This directory contains different versions of an example program which
shows MemCheck in operation.

!Normal
~~~~~~~

This is an application compiled with no MemChecking, that deliberately
accesses out of reach areas, and basically does naughty things with the
memory. Run !Normal.RunProg, and you will see that it falls over and
dies after a while, but certainly not on the first illegal access, or
even with a helpful error message.

!MemCheck
~~~~~~~~~

This is the same application compiled with C version 5, and linked
with the 'MemCheck:o.MC' library. When !MemCheck.RunProg is run the
display clearly indicates each illegal access as it happens, and even
provides throwback to the source.

!MC_4
~~~~~

This is the same as !MemCheck, except compiled with C version 4, and
hence linked with the 'MemCheck:o.MC_4.' library.

Note that Link version 4 (as supplied with Acorn's Desktop C product)
will not work with any of the MemCheck libraries. However, there is a
freeware linker 'DRLink' which does.

Another restriction with using MemCheck with Desktop C is that code in
the MC_4 library will not work on a StrongARM.





All these examples can be rebuilt, by double clicking them, but the
Makefiles may need slight editing. Specifically we assume that:

1) Makatic is on Run$Path somewhere.
2) !MemCheck has been seen by the Filer.
2) The C compiler version 4 is called cc400.
3) The C version 4 stubs library is called Stubs4.
