This is an example program to show MemCheck in operation with programs
that use the 'Flex' libary, derived from RISC_OSLib. Anyone using
similar memory allocation/deallocation libraries will probably need to
build similar veneer functions around their memory calls.

!Normal
~~~~~~~

This is an application compiled with no MemChecking, that deliberately
accesses out of reach areas, and basically does naughty things with
the memory. Run !Normal.RunProg, and you will see that it falls over
and dies after a while, but certainly not on the first illegal access,
or even with a helpful error message.

!MemCheck
~~~~~~~~~

This is the same application compiled with C version 5, and linked
with the 'MemCheck:o.MC' library. When !MemCheck.RunProg is run the
display clearly indicates each illegal access as it happens, and even
provides throwback to the source.

There is no C version 4 version of this example.

Both these examples can be rebuilt, by double clicking them, but the
Makefiles may need slight editing. Specifically we assume that:

1) Makatic and MemCheck are on Run$Path somewhere.
2) flexlib is installed somewhere on C$Path.
