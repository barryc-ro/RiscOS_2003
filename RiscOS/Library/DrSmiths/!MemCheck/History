Released versions
òòòòòòòòòòòòòòòòò


1.00	17 May 1996

First commercial release by Warm Silence Software.


1.01	22 May 1996

Diagnostics from memmove veneer used to incorrectly claim to be from
memcpy veneer....

Some diagnostics from strcat veneer used to incorrectly claim to be from
strncat veneer.

Added MemCheck_RestoreChecking, and altered SetChecking functions to
return info on current checking.

Added MemCheck:o.MCFlex and MemCheck:Flex.h - wrapper library for flex.


1.02	07 Jun 1996

MemCheck.CC now chains cc using system( "chain: ..."), which should give
slightly more memory to cc, and also return non-zero if cc fails
(previously, MemCheck.CC would get control back after cc, and always
return 0).

Fixed some bugs in MCFlex - MemCheck_Flex__Alloc now returns 0/1
(failure/success) etc.

Added source code for MCFlex.


1.07	29 Jul 1996

Outputs stack backtrace after attempt to free unrecognised block.

Attempts to free unknown blocks now report the address given to
free()/realloc(), rather than 4 words below it.

Outputs address of end of each malloc block, as well as start and size.

Fixed bug in MemCheck_SetQuitting.

MemCheck now calls an empty function 'MemCheck_DDTTrap' after any memory
violation has been reported. MemCheck_DDTTrap is compiled with debugging
enabled, so users of DDT can set a breakpoint at it and gain control.

MemCheckL:o.MC_M is compiled for use with modules - modified to work
automatically with SVC stack.

Improved detection of accesses to stackframe headers - some headers were
ignored.

Looks for misc blocks first when searching memory - allows parts of
malloc blocks to be set readonly etc.

Added MemCheck_ResizeMiscBlock.

Made display of Misc blocks show size of block.




1.10	21 Aug 1996

Added MemCheck_SetBlockAccess().

Now intercepts getenv, and marks returned string as readable.

Added MemCheck_CheckMallocHeap().

Changed stack-searching to much simpler and better code...

Added MemCheck_DDTTrap_buffer - contains brief info on error.

Added MemCheck_SetReportFrees() - outputs a diagnostic every time a
malloc block is freed.

Adding wrapper for _kernel_swi() - registers any returned os_error.
Added wrapper for _kernel_last_error().
Made SetBlockRead/Writable SetAccess accept (const void*) rather than (void*).
Added MemCheck_SetOSBuffersLifetime().

Adding MemCheck_RegisterMiscStack.

Module build registers __ctype as a 256 byte array in Init.
MemCheck_RedirectToFilename uses line buffering on file.

Added MemCheck_Finalise - used to free all memory in module version.

0.00


0.01	10 Feb 1996

Searches any debug data in AIF file, and displays line-number of source
instruction, plus throwback. 

Very brief !Help file written.


0.02	11 Feb 1996

Added this history file...

Minor changes to !Help.


0.03	12 Feb 1996

Made most of symbols in AOF file non-global, to avoid clashes if linked
with (for eg) DeskLib or StubsHack.

Removed a couple of DeskLib dependancies from the test app.

Required 'MemCheck_MEMCHECK' to be predefined instead of 'MEMCHECK'.



0.04	13 Feb 1996

Made misc block code work, and added misc-block code to test app.

Replaced all internal names in AOF file with cryptic ones...



0.05	15 Feb 1996

Improved the !Help file.

Removed MemCheck_INTERNAL test in MemCheck.h, to make the header file a
bit clearer. stack checking is now turned off for MemCheck source files
by internal Defs.h header.

Tidied up stderr diagnostics.



0.06	17 Feb 1996

Added C4-compatible version.
Debug data can now be loaded even if !RunImage isn't at 0x8000. Not
tested actually, but it works with 0x8000 programs.

Stubs4-compatible version made.


0.07	18 Feb 1996

Made throwback add !RunImage.^ filename to start of source filename -
works for most cases.


0.08	24 Feb 1996

Added read-write and zero-init areas of AIF image to MemCheck's list of
known blocks - access to global arrays work now.

Added replacement for <stdio.h> which makes getc and putc call the
non-macro functions, to avoid MemCheck thinking there is an error when
the internals of a FILE's buffer are accessed.


0.09	26 Feb 1996

Added note about stack problem to !Help

First beta release.


0.10	27 Feb 1996	Second beta release.

Minor changes to !Help

Added requirement to compile with -fw, to put string literals in a
separate data area, rather than within code.

Hopefully fixed problem with stack checking. Stack chunks are found, and
stack frames are only used to tell whether a ptr points to the top 4
words of a stack frame.

Added MemCheck_SetQuitting(), to control whether MemCheck terminates
program after a bad memory access.

Made output list known malloc blocks, misc blocks and stack info after
each error.

Added function to redirect MemCheck output to a new stream.
Added printf function to send text to MemCheck's stream.


0.11	28 Feb 1996

Minor changes to !Help


02 Mar 1996
Added MemCheck_RedirectToFilename
Added MemCheck_RedirectToFilenamef


10 Mar 1996
If unregistered malloc block is freed, MemCheck no longer aborts, and
outputs blocks info.


13 Mar 1996

Improved !Help. Cleaned up Test program.


15 Mar 1996	0.14

Added MemCheck_StoreMallocFunctions() - allows storing of function
nesting used for each m/re/calloc, so that diagnostics show where each
block was malloc-ed from.


24 Mar 1996

const void* used in MemCheck_RegisterMiscBlock etc.
Added MemCheck_SetRead/WriteChecking/Quitting.

MemCheck_StoreMallocFunctions -> MemCheck_SetStoreMallocFunctions

Improved !Help's description of test app.
Fixed test-app's makefiles etc.


26 Mar 1996

Added MemCheck_(Un)RegisterFlexBlock().

27 Mar 1996

Added MemCheck_ResizeFlexBlock()
Corrected null-macro names for MemCheck_RedirectToFilename(f).
Added read/write protection of individual blocks.
Added control for default read/write access for malloc, misc and flex
blocks.

28 Mar 1996

Added more comments to header file, and added StrongHelp / HTML help
pages for the MemCheck functions.

29 Mar 1996	0.20

Added MemCheck_SetDefaultMallocAccess etc.

Beta006

29 Mar 1996	0.21

Added MemCheck.MakeStdIO.!MakeStdIO program to make the stdio.h
header-file automatically.



02 Apr 1996	0.22	Beta007

Added MemCheck_InterceptSCLStringFunctions() - for checking of arguments
passed to strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, memcpy and memmove.
Not tested very much at the mo.





12 Apr 1996

Added MemCheck_RegisterArgs, and added more cross-refs to MemCheck.h

Added MemCheck.CC to automatically add the correct MemCheck flags to cc
command-line.

13 Apr 1996

Improved checking code - now checks whole byte / halfword / word is
within a block, rather than just the first byte. This uses the
range-checking code written for safe str/mem ANSI functions.

Improved ANSI function veneers strcpy etc.

14 Apr 1996	0.23	Beta008

Added MemCheck_SetAutoOutputBlocksInfo - controls whether to list known
blocks after each mem fault.

Fixed small bug in strncpy veneer.

Changed MemCheck to an application directory, to allow easy use of
MemCheck.CC by adding to Run$Path in !Boot. The new !MemCheck directory
should not be moved into C$Path - all files are now accessed using
the 'MemCheck:' prefix. Thus one should now use '#include
"MemCheck:MemCheck.h"', and link with 'MemCheck:o.MemCheck'.

Improved !Help.


16 Apr 1996

Attempts to free unknown malloc/misc/flex block now gives throwback.
Fixed HierProf.CC and !Help docs usage of -J flag to use MemCheck:
instead of C:MemCheck.

Added note to !Help about problems with cc -J when the ANSI header files
are in the current cc -I include path.

Added note to !Help about how calling MemCheck_Init after a malloc will
cause subsequent attempts to free/realloc the block to fail.



18 Apr 1996	0.23	beta009

Fixed brain-dead treatment of 'p=malloc(0);p=realloc(p,...);'.

Libraries now called MemCheck:o.MC/MC_4 . Now actual ALF files instead
of AOF files, so that the linker is able to leave them out if not
needed.



21 Apr 1996

Added wrapper for memset().

10 May 1996	0.24

Re-added detection of whether read/write checking is on - this got
deleted somewhere along the line.

Doesn't abort if illegal read/write is to zero bytes (eg with memcpy etc).




17 May 1996	1.00

First commercial release by Warm Silence Software.



21 May 1996

Diagnostics from memmove veneer used to incorrectly claim to be from
memcpy veneer....

Some diagnostics from strcat veneer used to incorrectly claim to be from
strncat veneer.

Added MemCheck_RestoreChecking, and altered SetChecking functions to
return info on current checking.


22 May 1996	1.01

Added MemCheck:o.MCFlex and MemCheck:Flex.h - wrapper library for flex.


30 May 1996

MemCheck.CC now chains cc using system( "chain: ..."), which should give
slightly more memory to cc, and also return non-zero if cc fails
(previously, MemCheck.CC would get control back after cc, and always
return 0).


07 Jun 1996	1.02

Fixed some stupid bugs in MCFlex - MemCheck_Flex__Alloc now returns 0/1
(failure/success) etc.



10 Jun 1996

MemCheck.cc Doesn't add -w flag when compilation is with -zm. This will
give lots of warnings about illegal reads from within the code space,
but -fw doesn't work well with -zm.


14 Jun 1996

No stack blocks are output in module version - don't know where the SVC
stack is.



17 Jun 1996

Added note to !Help about using MemCheck_OutputBlocksInfo() to find
memory leaks, and also about compiler bug with cc -zpc1 and
*(int*)"SQSH".


Outputs stack backtrace after attempt to free unrecognised block.


18 Jun 1996

Attempts to free unknown blocks now report the address given to
free()/realloc(), rather than 4 words below it.


18 Jul 1996	1.03

Outputs address of end of each malloc block, as well as start and size.


18 Jul 1996	1.04

Fixed bug in MemCheck_SetQuitting.

18 Jul 1996	1.05

MemCheck now calls an empty function 'MemCheck_DDTTrap' after any memory
violation has been reported. MemCheck_DDTTrap is compiled with debugging
enabled, so users of DDT can set a breakpoint at it and gain control.

18 Jul 1996

MemCheckL:o.MC_M is compiled for use with modules - modified to work
automatically with SVC stack.

19 Jul 1996	1.06

Removed some bogus longfilenames.


24 Jul 1996

Improved detection of accesses to stackframe headers - some headers were
ignored.

Made code-area readable in module builds.

Looks for misc blocks first when searching memory - allows parts of
malloc blocks to be set readonly etc.


25 Jul 1996

Sends fp when intercepting __rt_rd/wrchk, so that MemCheck's own
stackframes can be ignored.

This has brought to light what appears to be a bug in cc -zpc1. The
following code was produced:

00008000 : ..M‚ : E24D0004 : SUB     R0,R13,#4
00008004 : .@†· : E1A04000 : MOV     R4,R0
00008008 : ~!.Î : EB00217E : BL      &00010608		; __rt_wrchk
0000800C : .çÂ : E58D00F0 : STR     R0,[R13,#240]
00008010 : ..†· : E1A00004 : MOV     R0,R4

- ie should have been

00008000 : ..M‚ : E24D0004 : ADD     R0,R13,#240
00008004 : .@†· : E1A04000 : MOV     R4,R0
00008008 : ~!.Î : EB00217E : BL      &00010608		; __rt_wrchk
0000800C : .çÂ : E58D00F0 : STR     R0,[R13,#240]
00008010 : ..†· : E1A00004 : MOV     R0,R4

The first code makes MemCheck complain about a write to unused stack -
one word below sp.

This didn't used to cause MemCheck to complain because of the
(unintentional) ignoring of some leaf stack-frames.

Have now made MemCheck treat unused stack as ok memory... This is far
from ideal, but the best I can do.


Added finding caller's fp to SCL veneers too.

Need to recompile module version and test things.



29 Jul 1996

Module version seems to work ok...

Added MemCheck_ResizeMiscBlock.

Made display of Misc blocks show size of block.


01 Aug 1996

Fixed silly bug in stack-searching - was searching for correct chunk and
correct fp in wrong order. This only caused problems when multiple stack
chunks were active.

Added MemCheck_SetBlockAccess().

Now intercepts getenv, and marks returned string as readable.

Added MemCheck_CheckMallocHeap().



02 Aug 1996	1.08

Changed stack-searching to much simpler and better code...

Added MemCheck_DDTTrap_buffer - contains brief info on error.


05 Aug 1996

Prefixed 'Illegal read/write...' line with 'MemCheck:' in diagnostics.
This prefix was removed by mistake when putting int
MemCheck_DDTTrap_buffer code.


07 Aug 1996

Added MemCheck_SetReportFrees() - outputs a diagnostic every time a
malloc block is freed.

Recompiled, /then/ added #define for MemCheck_SetReportFrees() to
MemCheck.h 8( .

Adding wrapper for _kernel_swi() - registers any returned os_error.

Added wrapper for _kernel_last_error().


08 Aug 1996

Made SetBlockRead/Writable SetAccess accept (const void*) rather than (void*).
Added MemCheck_SetOSBuffersLifetime().


19 Aug 1996

Now uses Desk instead of DeskLib.
05:29pm	Checked in.

Adding MemCheck_RegisterMiscStack.


20 Aug 1996

Module build registers __ctype as a 256 byte array in Init.
MemCheck_RedirectToFilename uses line buffering on file.

03:43pm

Now seems to work ok in modules, apart from CMHG's irq veneer's stack
breaking _kernel_unwind().

Fixed bug - sp is inside a chunk if it points one word above the chunk
(first available stack word is at sp-4).

Checked in < 04:20pm


05:46pm

Added MemCheck_Finalise - used to free all memory in module version.
Module build uses ModMalloc.


21 Aug 1996	1.09

23 Aug 1996

MemCheck_Finalise now closes output stream if not stderr/stdout, in
MC_M. Also closes MemCheck debugging output stream.

Made MeMChecks's own version of Debug to unique file, to avoid debug
file being opened before SCL finctions are interecepted.

MemCheck_CheckMallocHeap doesn't attempt check when both checkreads and
checkwrites are 0. Useful for moduletask upcall handlers, which can be
called when app space not in place.

Debug module versions use Desk_M_D

0-length misc blocks now match ptrs, but will only be ok if read/write
is zero length (eg memcpy(,,0)).



02 Sep 1996

Made ptr past to RegisterMiscBlock a (const void*).


09 Sep 1996

Changed mask for MemCheck__GetCaller to 0x03fffffc (used to be
incorrectly 0x00fffffc). Instruction addresses used to be wrong for RMA
code.

Registers module zeroinit and readwrite areas properly - offset by
[sl,#-536]. Thanks to Tom Hughs for explaining this to me.

Outputs backtrace when unregistering unknown block.



23 Sep 1996	1.10beta

Added StrongARM flushing...
Changed to use SCL _swix rather than straylight's version.


24 Sep 1996

Module version not linked with Desk_LinkList_InsertAfter. Due to
ModMalloc changing I think. Reordeing list of libries to partically link
with ...

non-module version now doesn't register static as though it was a
module...

Module version bug. debug lib flushes stream after every write.

Fixed bug in .s code in !MemCheck.o.Sources.Sources.s.ModData - didn't
save lr.

Now calls exit() in module builds rather than abort().

Stack-walking does checks for end of stack - _kernel_unwind doesn't
return 0 early enough when used with SVC stack.


24 Sep 1996	1.11beta

25 Sep 1996	03:55pm	Checked in

25 Sep 1996	Adding guard word at end of each malloc block.


25 Sep 1996	1.12beta

Guard word seems to work...


27 Sep 1996	1.13beta

Made StrongARM compatible.


21 Oct 1996	1.14beta

Included !MemCheck.ANSI directory in zip file.


22 Oct 1996
Making debug version - turning up all diagnostics in stack code.

MemCheck.h typedefs MemCheck_checking even when MemCheck_MEMCHECK is not
defined. This is so that user code which stores old checking will
compile in non-MemCheck builds.

All diagnostics are echoed to debug output... Doesn't work too well - va
is corrupted by vfprintf???


23 Oct 1996

Turned off sigsegv and sigabrt around backtrace output.

06:45pm	Desk_BackTrace functions more careful when finding embedded
function names - length must be < 4096.


24 Oct 1996	1.16

Fixed bug introduced by gaurd-word checking. Bug caused MemCheck's
realloc wrapper to overwrite beyond end of a malloc block. Oh for a
MemCheck-ed MemCheck... 

Checked in

25 Oct 1996

MemCheck doesn't abort after failing to walk the stack.


28 Oct 1996	1.17

Outputing diagnostics about corrupt stack when it happens...

When looking for matching stackchunk for a sp, starts looking from
current chunk, found immediately without fn call. Avoids potential
problems with chunk being a newly allocated chunk, which is then removed
from chunk list, making subsequent chunk-walking fail.

Checked in

29 Oct 1996

Working on making MemCheck C4-compatible - previous versions turned out
not to be. cc5 and objasm 3 generate code that link4 can't handle...

Decided to require DRLink - objasm2 lacks the -i flag necessary to build
various libraries.

Added !!ReadMe files to the various examples directories, and a few
minor changes to !Help.

1.17 released



31 Oct 1996

flushes outputstream in debug builds.
Fixed bug in reporting of overlaping-blocks in memcpy - diagnostics
weren't printed properly.
Now treats memcpy/strcpy etc with overlapping blocks as a write to
illegal memory, for the purposes of deciding whether to terminate the
program.

1.18



04 Nov 1996

memcpy with overlapping blocks is now treated as a read error when
deciding whether to terminate the program.


05 Nov 1996

Outputs more detailed info from DDT area - function name etc.


06 Nov 1996

Outputs low-level debug data for instructions (offset from and name of
nearest prev code symbol) when high-level isn't present (eg when link -d
is used with .o files that don't contain debug information).

Fixed bug in DDT scanning - now rounds file fragment pointers up to
word.

checked in

1.19



13 Dec 1996

Made unreg flex output blocks info after attempt to unreg unknwon flex
block. Such an error is treated as a read error when deciding whether to
abort the program.


20 Dec 1996

Working on making output diagnostics output fn name using embedded
names, in adittion to using dfft info. Not started.


23 Dec 1996

Outputs offset of instruction into module in MC_M

13 Jan 1997	1.20

Minor changes to !Help - extra info about use with modules, deprecated
use of MemCheck.CC .


10 Feb 1997

Now closes old stream when redirecting output to new stream/file.

11 Feb 1997
Fixed minor bug in closing of old stream.


17 Feb 1997

Fixed bug in checking for overlapping memory in memcpy. Previously,
memcpy( a, a+n, n) was incorrectly faulted. Thanks to Tom Tanner for
spotting this one.

--- 1.21 ---


27 Mar 1997

If MemCheck_Init* is called more than once, the diagnostic now says
'Warning' - this is a non-fatal error and MemCheck will function
perfectly.

MemCheck_RestoreChecking( checking) now macros to (checking)=(checking)
when MemCheck_MEMCHECK not defined - should prevent compiler warnings of
unused variables in things like:
	{
	MemCheck_checking	oldchecking = MemCheck_SetChecking( 0, 0);
	...
	MemCheck_RestoreChecking( oldchecking);
	}

MemCheck_SetReportFrees() now effects freeing of misc blocks as well as
freeing of malloc blocks.


28 Mar 1997

Added MemCheck_RedirectToFunction(), and cleaned up the internal
printing functions.


11 Apr 1997
Added MemCheck_threaddepth, for use by thread-switching systems, so that
they can refuse to switch threads while memcheck is threaded.

-- version 1.22 --


01 May 1997

Added MemCheck_SetMallocHeapChecking() - determimes whether malloc heap
is checked every time malloc, realloc or free are called.


02 May 1997

Module now looks for ddt info, and so provides exact source-position
information. Currently needs modules to be linked with aof.ddtmodlink,
otherwise will complain of missing symol which is expected to point to
debugdata.


06 May 1997

Added MemCheck_SetMallocHeapChecking().

06 Jun 1997

Modules don't need to be linked with aof.ddtmodlink - the relevent
symbols are now weak, so reduce to 0 unless defined in client code.


20 Jun 1997

Made MemCheck_SetDefaultMiscAccess() MemCheck_SetDefaultFlexAccess() and
MemCheck_SetDefaultMallocAccess() visible in library - were being
removed by AOF.TrimAOF in the build.


30 Jul 1997

Put DDTModLink inside !MemCheck.


19 Aug 1997

-- version 1.23 --


21 Oct 1997

Added MemCheck_SetStoreMiscFunctions() - stores backtrace with each misc
block.

Added MemCheck_SetReportAllocs().


-- version 1.24 --


07 Jan 1998

Fixed typo - used to warn about 'No Desk_Debugging information
available.'. Now says 'No Debugging information available.'.

MemCheck_RegisterArgs now makes each arg string readable and writable -
used to be read only, which conflicts with ANSI C.


-- version 1.25 --


Fri 03 Apr 1998

Adding public MemCheck_CheckRange function (having to rename exiting
internal MemCheck_CheckRange to MemCheck__CheckRange).



Wed 08 Apr 1998

Recompiled with bug-fixed Debug library, which could fail to find source
positions, especially in C++ programmes.

Outputs source info slightly differently.


-- version 1.26 --


Mon 20 Apr 1998
Unmangles C++ fn names in malloc block info.

Wed 22 Apr 1998
Allows read/write anywhere below sp in current stack, because cc -zpc1
can give code that pretends to read from here even though it doesn't...


Fri 24 Apr 1998
Adding support for coping with malloc blocks that are allcoated without
memcheck's knowledge. This is with the function
MemCheck_SetMungeBadFrees in MemCheck/BadFrees.h. Not described in docs
yet though. This if for use with C++ which allocates stuff using malloc
before main(), then can realloc it later.


Thu 14 May 1998
Preserving MemCheck_threaddepth symbol in library. Seems to be required
when using cc4 and drlink.

MC_4 now linked internally with Straylight's StrongARM-compatible _swix
veneer.

For some reason, MemCheck can't find source info from CC v 4.00 built
programmes' DDT info. Prob because of c4 generating older debug info
format.


-- version 1.27 --


Mon 01 Jun 1998
Minor improvements to diagnostics produced by MemCheck.DDTMakeMod.
Added note in docs about memcheck.ddtmodlink requiring the Utilities
directory to be added to run$path.



Sun 14 Jun 1998

Making searching of malloc blocks use a binary tree, instead of a linear
search.

7x as fast for one test case. The improvement is O(N) -> O(logN) though,
so ratio will vary. Note that other stuff such as misc and flex block
searching is still O(N).


-- version 1.28 --
