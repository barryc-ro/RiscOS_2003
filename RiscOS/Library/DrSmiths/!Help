Introduction
˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜

	The two main parts of the toolkit are MemCheck (for finding
	illegal memory accesses) and HierProf (for detailed
	time-profiling).
	
	In addition, the directory 'Utilities' contains some
	command-line tools which may be useful.
	
	Each of the '!MemCheck', '!HierProf' and 'Utilities' directories
	contains a full !Help file. 
	
	The information in this file and the three !Help files is also
	contained in DrawFile form within the 'DrawDocs' directory, and
	in the TechWriter (Professional) file within the 'TWProDocs'
	directory.
