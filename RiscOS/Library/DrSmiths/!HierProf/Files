!HierProf.

	!Help		
	!Sprites
	
	History		Some info on HierProf development.	
	
	Files		This file.
	
	!Boot		Sets HierProf$Dir and HierProf$Path
			Creates the directories <Wimp$ScrapDir>.HierProf.c/c++ etc
		
	!Run		Runs !Boot and opens !Help.
	
	
	o.		Various versions of the HierProf library.
	
		HP		Library to link with profiled programs. 
				This contains all the time-measuring 
				code etc, and uses clock() for timing.
		
		HP_T1		Uses 2MHz from IOC's timer1
		
		HP_GCC, HP_T1_GCC
				Versions of the library for use with GCC
				- all references to Acorn's non-FP
				'_fprintf' etc are replaced by
				'fprintf'.
		
		HP_4, HP_T1_4	Versions of the library that are
				compatible with Acorn's	C version 4 (C5
				uses new stubs symbols).
		
		
		Data.
			HPData	Library containing 'HierProf_LoadData'
				function for loading HierProf output
				file.
	
	h.
		HierProf	Header file for HPLib. Contains
				#defines for HierProf_Start etc,
				and declarations for the 
				functions in HPLib
		
		Data		Header for data-reading library.
	
	sh.
		WrapMacro	Contains an assembler macro used
				by HierProfOO.
		
	
	Bin.
	
		HierProf.	Sub directory which contains all
				HierProf tools.
				
			CC		Frontend to any C compiler,
					which adds profile calls to C
					source code before compilation.
			
			ConvertAOF	Program which converts AOF
					files. Actually, this is an Obey
					script file which uses link,
					objasm and HierProfOb.
			
			ConvertALF	Program for converting ALF files
			
			_AOF		Used by ConvertAOF - not useful
					on its own.
			
			Every2		Runs command on matching files.
	
	
	Test.Simple		This contains an example C
				project which can be compiled
				for normal or profiling use.
				
			c.		C source code.
			h.		Headers.
			
			TemplateMF.	Used by Makatic.
		
			!Normal.	Directory containing
					normally-compiled .o
					files etc.
					Double-clicking this
					directory will (re)build
					the project.
				
				RunProg This runs the program.
				
			!HierProf.	Directory containing 
					.o files compiled for
					profiling.
					Double-clicking this
					directory will (rebuild
					the project.
					
				RunProg This runs the program.
			
			!HP_T1.	Uses 2MHz timer1 HierProf library.
