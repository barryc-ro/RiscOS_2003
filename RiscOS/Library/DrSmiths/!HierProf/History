Released versions
òòòòòòòòòòòòòòòòò

2.06	09 Nov 1995 (freeware release)

Uses HierProfCC to provide C preprocessing.





3.15	26 Feb 1996 (first beta release)

Added ConvertAOF (plus various support functions and tools) so that
profiling can be added to AOF files without recompiling.

HierProf can now cope with up to 65536 different functions (max was 256
in version 2).

Enabled profiling versions of Stubs to be used, and added info about
doing this to !Help.

Added preliminary Timer1 version of library, for 10kHz resolution.



3.34	20 Mar 1996 (beta)

HierProf.CC doesn't require -o parameter. 

ConvertAOF sets output filetype to data.

Improved timing correction, and added min, max and stddev statistics.

Now uses 2MHz timer1.

Added runtime finding of functions, as alternative to
HierProf.CC/ConvertAOF.

Improved output of raw-functions. 

Outputs exact machine-readable data, and added library function to read
such data for use with custom analysis program.





4.00	17 May 1996

First commercial release by Warm Silence Software.

Removed hex ticks and ticks^2 count in function-timings.

Now partially-linked with Straylight's swiv library, to enable use
without Acorn stubs.

Generated version for use with gcc with '_printf' replaced by 'printf' etc.

Removed need for _kernel_unwind - present in debug versions only.

Timer1 library now called 'HP_T1' instead of 'HPLib_T1'. This is to allow
GCC-version 'HP_T1_GCC'.

C4-version of library now has suffix '_4' instead of '4'.

Stddev calculation fixed in tree-display.

HierProf:o.HP* are now ALF files, rather than AOF, so that they aren't
automatically included in executables.

















Detailed history
òòòòòòòòòòòòòòòò


1.00	?? ??? 1994

Just a set of macros and a library.


2.00	02 Oct 1995

Added HierProfCC and wasted-time correction.

2.01
Fixed a parsing bug in ScanC - a '{' in comments could confuse it.


2.02	09 Oct 1995

Removed requirement that .c file is the last param to HierProfCC.
Doesn't need or do '-I,C:' - uses '-I<HierProf$Dir>.'.
Ignores recursive functions - also mutual recursion.
Improved the calculations of wasted time.


2.03	10 Oct 1995

Added simple and crude individual-function output


2.04	13 Oct 1995

Added 'Recursion' block whenever a recursion is detected
Does '-IHierProf:' rather than '-I<HierProf$Dir>.' - I think the
latter breaks cc4.

Added various #defines to enable compilation on non-riscos systems.
This hasn't been tested yet.


2.05	15 Oct 1995

Removed NullOutputToFilenamef - use '(1) ? 0 : printf' as a dummy
unlimited-args fn.



07 Nov 1995

Outputs text of call to cc to stdout before calling it.

Uses a c++ directory for C++ programs - Acorn's C++ doesn't cope with
source files inside a .c. directory

Copes with C++ style comments.

Uses leafname of input file if it is C++ - Acorn C++ always seems to
ouput a .o file with same leafname as input file, regardless of -o
directive.


2.06	09 Nov 1995

Corrected bug in handling beyond maximum nesting.


First release.



22 Nov 1995

Added HierProf__Start/StopClock2( char* fname). These just use a char*
to identify the function.



27 Nov 1995

Added HierProfOO program, which creates a HierProf-using version of an
AOF file.

Removed the restriction on there being 256 functions.


3.00	29 Nov 1995

Moved all tools into '!HierProf.Bin.HierProf.'. To run, use
'*hierprof.convertaof' etc. This is to avoid tool name-clashes.

Added 'Bin.HierProf.ConvertALF'.




3.01	12 Dec 1995

Made the error-handling slightly better. The error messages are messy,
but a little more useful than previously.

Corrected a call to sizeof - was using sizeof( xxx*) rather than sizeof(
int). These can be different on non-Acorn systems...




3.10	19 Dec 1995

ConvertAOF now accepts a list of wild-carded symbols to exclude. Useful
for makeing a HierProf version of Stubs...

Modified HierProf library so that it ignores re-enterent profile calls,
so that a profiled version of Stubs can be used.




3.11	02 Feb 1996

Added info to !Help about making HP version of Stubs.


3.12	18 Feb 1996

Example app uses latest Makatic, so makefiles can be run without
Makatic.


HierProf library is now actually an AOF file made with 'link -aof...'.
Stubs4-compatible files made using AOF.Stubs5to4 converter.



3.13	19 Feb 1996

Improved profiling to fix bugs in time-correcting.



3.14	21 Feb 1996

Added Timer1 version of library - uses 100kHz timer in IOC.
Improved the output formatting slightly.


3.15	26 Feb 1996

Improved timing correction for outermost loop.
Added local version of Timer1 MakeMod.


3.16	28 Feb 1996

Minor changes to !Help



3.17	04 Mar 1996

Now works even if input doesn't have a '-o <outfile>' parameter.
ConvertAOF sets output file to data.


3.20	07 Mar 1996

Used a different method of correcting for time spent within HierProf
functions. This should allow future collection of things like sum(t^2)
for stddev statistics.

Added second IOC Timer1 timer, turned on by compiling with
-DHierProf_TIMER1b and linking with HierProf:o.HP_T1b.

Timer1b uses the full 2MHz resolution of IOC Timer1, but unfortunately
the function which reads the time has a large overhead (around 15-20us).
This makes the overhead for a null function 20us, compared to Timer1's
3us.



3.30	09 Mar 1996

Added facility to find all functions at runtime, instead of interfering
with AOF or C source files. This idea due to Domonic Symes.




3.31	09 Mar 1996

Ensured that functions which consist of a single instruction are dealt
with properly.

HierProf_ProfileAllFunctions() et al ignore fns where the first
instruction refers to pc - can't easily copy such an instruction
elsewhere.

Added correction for the time spent inside time-reading code; this makes
using the full 2MHz of Timer1 practical (correction is ~19us per call).

There is still some time associated with the code which calls the
HierProf timing functions before and after each function. This is around
3us using HierProf.CC and 7-8us using run-time addition of profiling
with HierProf_ProfileAllFunctions().

(All times are for a 25MHz A5000 in mode 31).

Added min, max and stddev statistics to output.




3.32	10 Mar 1996

HierProf_OutputToTempFile now called HierProf_OutputToUniqueFile.
Fixed bug with calling OutputNow before HierProf has been inited.



12 Mar 1996

Removed Timer1_* functions from .o symbol list.

HP_printfn->HP__printfn etc.


17 Mar 1996

Used 64-bit integer for total_t^2 instead of double, so that profiling
can work in non-USR modes (as long as the SCL data in stack chunk is
valid). 

Improved display of raw-function data.

HierProf_OutputToFunction now expects a vfprintf-type function, rather
than a fprintf one.

Hidden all functions which aren't for external use.


18 Mar 1996	3.33

Timer1b no longer uses external BASIC program to assemble Timer1b
module.

Removed 10kHz timer. HierProf:o.HPLib_T1 now uses new 2MHz timer.

Outputs better individual fn info - sorted by name, time and av time.

Ouputs info in numerical form, for machine reading of all profiling
info.




19 Mar 1996	3.34

Added HierProf_IgnoreFunctions
Added library for loading profile data from file (header
'HierProf:Data.h' and library 'HierProf:o.Data.HPData', and example
program which uses this library - in '!HierProf.Test.Data.'.

20 Mar 1996	3.35

Removed hex ticks and ticks^2 count in function-timings.



29 Mar 1996	3.36

Now partially-linked with Straylight's swiv library, to enable use
without Acorn stubs.

Generated version for use with gcc with '_printf' replaced by 'printf' etc.

Removed need for _kernel_unwind - present in debug versions only.

Timer1 library now called 'HP_T1' instead of 'HPLib_T1'. This is to allow
GCC-version 'HP_T1_GCC'.

C4-version of library now has suffix '_4' instead of '4'.

Stddev calculation fixed in tree-display.



17 Apr 1996

Updated 'Files' file.



19 Apr 1996

HierProf:o.HP* are now ALF files, rather than AOF, so that they aren't
automatically included in executables.


17 May 1996	4.00

Small changes to docs etc.



12 Aug 1996

Test program runs from Obey file, rather than TaskObey. This avoids
negative min times.


19 Aug 1996	4.01

Runtime wrappers now restore flags.
Now uses Desk, instead of DeskLib.


05 Sep 1996	4.02

HierProf.CC now adds its flags to end of command line, allowing (if you
really feel the need) 'MemCheck.CC HierProf.CC cc ...'.

Removed the above changes - it's importatnt that the flags are before
any other flags, so that the original file's dir is searched first for
eg.


05 Sep 1996

Made HierProf.CC handle errors better - eg checking return code from
system()...


19 Sep 1996

Added dection of function->n=0 in individual fn output (prints 'NAN' in
average).


27 Sep 1996	4.02

Adding code to flusdh SA cache, and stopped linking with standalone
_swix library. Now runs on SA 8) .


13 Jan 1997	4.03

Fixed bug - flags not preserved when profiling reentered functions.



23 Jan 1997

Minor change to <DDD$Dir>.WSS.!HierProf.Examples.Data - displays min/max
etc.


24 Apr 1997

Making module version. Have to do FP by hand, as not allowed in SVC
mode.

Rough version works ok both using clock() and Timer1 for the timing. The
display of times is very crude though - percentages ok, but timings come
out like 344/2000000 etc/



16 Jul 1997

Few minor changes to correction code. WIll have to take into account the
time taken by assembler veneers though...

Corrected HierProf_ReturnValue() macro - used to use HierProf__fnref.



17 Jul 1997

Unmangles C++ names in output.

21 Jul 1997

Now corrects for time spent in veneers (only runtime munging veneers -
other profile methods will be over-compensated). The correction is done
only once at startup, and can be seen in the final output - the
'HierProf calibration' line. Only in HT_T_A3 (test builds).


11 Aug 1997

Adding HierProf_UseCustomClock() to allow user's own timing functions.


-- version 4.11 --



21 Aug 1997

Added HierProf_ProfileAllFunctionsListStdOut().
Will now ignore functions whose first instruction is ADR when profiling
all functions.


22 Aug 1997

Added ModMalloc to library.



24 Sep 1997

Removed some FP printfing which caused data aborts in module version,
introduced 21 Jul 1997. 

Now prints proper FP numbers in module version. Also cleaned up some
minor aspects of formatting.

Added module version of example program.

Fixed bug in HierProf_ReturnValue() - now uses HierProf__fnref instead
of HierProf__ref.



-- version 4.20 --


Thu 14 May 1998

Fixing build of c4 version - uses latest SA-compatible stubs and renamed
__rt_sdiv to x$divide.

-- version 4.21 --
