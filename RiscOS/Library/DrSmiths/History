27 Feb 1996	Beta001

First beta release. MemCheck doesn't cope with programs with more than
one stack chunk - accesses to stack data is faulted in such programs.


28 Feb 1996	Beta002

MemCheck: stack problem fixed. Added cc -fw ... requirement for
compiling for use with MemCheck, so that access to string literals is
allowed. Added control for whether MemCheck quits program after memory
error. Outputs list of all known blocks for every error. Can now
redirect MemCheck output to new stream. Added MemCheck_Printf for user
use.

HierProf: Renamed 'Examples' directory to 'Test'.

Added brief info on utilities.




09 Mar 1996	Beta003

HierProf: various small fixes suggested by Domonic Symes. Full 2MHz
timer1 available. Now corrects for the time spent reading the time.
Functions can be found at run-time. Added min, max and stddev
statistics.


11 Mar 1996	Beta004

Only minor changes:

HierProf: HierProf_OutputToTempFile now called
HierProf_OutputToUniqueFile. Fixed bug with calling HierProf_OutputNow
before HierProf has been inited.



17 Mar 1996	Beta005

MemCheck: Improved MemCheck's !Help and test program. Added
MemCheck_StoreMallocFunctions().

HierProf: Now doesn't use FP in timing code. Improved raw-function
display. HierProf_OutputToFunction changed. Hidden all functions which
aren't for external use. No longer uses BASIC program to make module.
Exact timings available in machine-readable form. Removed 10kHz library.



29 Mar 1996	Beta006

HierProf: Runtime can ignore functions.
Added library for loading profile data from file
_GCC version should work without stubs (not tested).
Changed names of libraries to 'HP', 'HP_T1', 'HP_T1_GCC', 'HP_4' etc.

MemCheck:
Fixed test-app makefiles.
Control of whether to quit after memory fault.
Proper support for flex blocks.
Each block can have its own read and write permissions.
Control of whether to quit after block-access fault.
Can set default Malloc/Misc/Flex block access permissions.
Added StrongHelp and HTML help pages generated from .h file.


02 Apr 1996	Beta007

MemCheck: 

Added MemCheck.MakeStdIO.!MakeStdIO program to make the stdio.h
header-file automatically. 

Added MemCheck_InterceptSCLStringFunctions()
- for checking of arguments passed to strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat,
memcpy and memmove.



14 Apr 1996	Beta008

MemCheck:

MemCheck now an application directory, and one now uses 
'#include "MemCheck:MemCheck.h"' and links with 'MemCheck:o.MemCheck'.

Added MemCheck_RegisterArgs for argc and argv. Added MemCheck.CC tool to
automatically add the correct MemCheck flags to cc command-line.
Improved checking code and ANSI str/mem wrappers. Added
MemCheck_SetAutoOutputBlocksInfo. Improved !Help.




19 Apr 1996	Beta009

Utilities: Every.Every2/Count/ListNewer now accept multiple specs, and
multiple exclude specs.

MemCheck: Attempts to free unknown malloc/misc/flex block now gives
throwback. Fixed HierProf.CC and !Help docs usage of -J flag to use
MemCheck: instead of C:MemCheck. MemCheck now copes with
'p=malloc(0);p=realloc(p,...);'. MemCheck library now called
'MemCheck:o.MC' and 'MemCheck:o.MC_4' rather than
'MemCheck:o.MemCheck_4'.

MemCheck and HierProf: All .o files are now ALF rather than AOF files,
so that link can leave them out of executables.




10 May 1996	Beta0010

Utilities: Added Makatic.ArgsFile.

MemCheck - set read/write checking works again. reads/wites to 0 bytes
never cause MemCheck to abort the program. Improved !Help




17 May 1996	1.00
First commercial release by Warm Silence Software.


22 May 1996	1.01

23 May 1996

Makatic now automatically removes dynamic-dependancies which depend on
non-existant files.


29 May 1996

Makatic removes dynamic-dependancies which depend on non-existant files
only if run with '-D' - removal is very slow, due to OS_File 5 taking
0.2 secs to find info for each file.

Added note in !MemCheck.!Help about use of
MemCheck_InterceptSCLStringFunctions() with libraries that aren't
compiled with MemCheck.CC

Moved TW and Drawfile docs into 'Docs' directory - Robin did this for
the demo release.
