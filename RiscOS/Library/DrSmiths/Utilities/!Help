The directory 'Utilities' contains some command-line tools which may be
useful.

Each tool gives full help if run with a '-help' parameter. This file is
just to give a brief overview.

Note that some of the simple Obey tools are dependant on others, and
assume that the 'Utilities' directory is put into Run$Path - the tools
themselves are run with (for example) 'AOF.Replace ...'.

If you don't like this system, it should be very easy to ammend the Obey
tools to work with your preferred tools names.
