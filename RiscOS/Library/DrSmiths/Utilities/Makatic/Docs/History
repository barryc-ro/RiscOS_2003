19 Jan 1996	2.00

First release


03 Feb 1996	2.03

For c++ bug: added Makatic._C++Move and included example project
'Large++'; also added note in !Help about c++ bug.

Added workaround for ImageFS bug.

Changed Makatic.Medium to use a separate makefile for each build-type.



17 Feb 1996	2.07

Changed fix for Acorn c++ bug, because c++ also generates incorrect
!Depend file. Also added not in !Help about Wimpslot problems with c++,
and added an example C-library project.



30 Mar 1996	2.10

Added -m flag to Makatic2. Changed Small/Medium/Large scripts to put any
extra macro definitions into the makefile using this flag, instead of
putting the macros into the AMU command.

This means that quotes are not needed when specifying macros with spaces
inside them.

For example, you should now do:
Makatic.Medium @ CCExtra="-g -DDEBUG" LinkExtra=-d OtherFlags=DEBUG

(Previously this would have been:
Makatic.Medium @ CCExtra='-g -DDEBUG'
- to use Makatic2's swapping of single and double quotes.)

The above change was made so that generated makefiles can be run with
AMU, without using Makatic.

Ignores all files with '.RCS.' in filename.



17 Oct 1996	2.18

Added Makatic.ArgsFile - simple tool for running commands with
parameters from a file.

Now treats image directories as directories.

Removes 'Foo.^' from generated filenames. This is needed because AMU
can't generate commands longer than 2048 chrs.

Can exclude certain files from search spec.
Eg
Makatic ... -f "Sources...c.* -x *...Bar.c.*" ...

Added Makatic.MultiILink - does an incremental libfile.
Added Makatic.MultiMF.
Added Makatic.CmdFile

Makatic2 -D strips any dyanmic-dependancies which depend on non-existant
files. Thus removal or renaming of a header file is handled
automatically - the user doesn't have to remove any effected dynamic
dependancies by hand.

Added -V <filename> flag to output objects to file for use with 'link -v
<filename>'. Useful when list of objects is more than 2048 - amu
truncates command lines longer than this; one can now do
'Makatic.Makatic2 -V objs ...' and make the link step in the template
makefile be something like '$(LINK) -o $@ -VIA objs $(Librarys)'.

Added Makatic.MultiBSub
Modified Makatic.MultiBSub and Makatic.ILink to use same filenames as
Makatic.Link. Otherwise, libraries can end up with two copies of the
same AOF files, with different names...

Added Makatic3 - inserts list of files into template makefile, and uses
Desk library. Added local -V option to output list of files to file.
Makatic3 was based on earlier version of Makatic2, without -V option in
main call.

Added Large2 - expects the caller to use the '-m' flag, which enables
Makatic flags to be set (for example -D).





Details
¨¨¨¨¨¨¨

11 Jan 1996
Makatic2 Canonicalises makefile filename before sending it to amu with
-a option. Now calls amu -desktop with -a option.

Added BuildLib and LibLib.

13 Jan 1996
Stopped LibLib from erroneously creating an incorrect tree of empty
directories.

15 Jan 1996
Makatic2 now prints blank line at start.


19 Jan 1996	2.00
First release.


26 Jan 1996	2.01
Added Makatic._C++Move and exampe C++ project 'Large++'.



28 Jan 1996	2.02

Added note in !Help about ImageFSFix bug and added fix.
Thanks to Mark Seaborn for telling me about this problem.

Changed Makatic.Medium to use a separate makefile for each build-type.





30 Jan 1996

Added MultiMFs - makes multi-project makefiles, but doesn't run them.
Changed Makatic._C++Move to use 'copy' instead of 'rename', and force
overwriting of any existing file.

03 Feb 1996	2.03

Added note to !Help about incorrect !Depend file produced by c++ when
used with >2 element filenames.



04 Feb 1996	2.04

Removed _C++Move. Added Mark Seaborn's '_C++Fix' program which, in
conjunction with _C++, moves the output of Acorn's c++ to the right
place, and also ammends any !Depend file which c++ generates using the
incorrect .o filename.




04 Feb 1996	2.04

Changed fix for Acorn c++ bug, because c++ also generates incorrect
!Depend file: _C++Move removed. Added _C++ and _C++Fix. _C++Fix was
written by Mark Seaborn.

Changed !Help to describe the new system.

05 Feb 1996

Added note about c++ running out of memory with long -o <filenames>.



12 Feb 1996	2.05

Yet another change to the fix for the Acorn c++ bug - Makatic._C++ is
now a small C prog to be used as a wrapper for C++, fixing the !Depend
and -o problems together.


15 Feb 1996

Added TestLib - example library.


17 Feb 1996	2.06

Added note about Wimpslot problems with c++, and made Large++ example
use 1000k Wimpslot.

Added Every2 to Makatic directory, and changed Multi scripts to use this
instead of 'Every.Every2'.


17 Feb 1996	2.07

Updated History file for this release version.


18 Feb 1996	2.08

Added -m flag to Makatic2, and changed scripts Small, Medium and Large
to use this flag.

This means that the generated makefiles can be run on their own without
Makatic - all special extra flags are stored in the makefile.

This means that you /shouldn't/ replace " by ' when calling the Small,
Medium or Large scripts - the arguments you send are put in the
makefile, where quotes aren't needed. See the example projects.


22 Feb 1996	2.09

Fixed small bug in Multi scripts - .o directory is created as
'<Sublibrary name>.<build type>.o', rather than '<Sublibrary name>.o'.

Made MultiLink generate a makefile with things like
'Libraries.<build-type>.o.*' rather than list all the individual .o
files - AMU can't cope with very long macro definitions.

Changed Makatic2 so that calling with a directory of
'<Makatic$ProjectDir>' will expand, to allow:

Makatic.MultiLink Debug |<DeskLib_Sources$Dir>

- which will put <DeskLib_Sources$Dir> into AOF files etc. Useful for
debugging, maybe... except it doesn't work



23 Feb 1996

'&' now stands for leafname-without-extension, (used to be '$').


02 Mar 1996

Ignores all files with '.RCS.' in filename.




30 Mar 1996	2.10

Released to hensa.



03 May 1996	2.11

Added Makatic.ArgsFile - simple tool for running commands with
parameters from a file.


13 May 1996	2.12

Now treats image directories as directories.

14 May 1996

Removes 'Foo.^' from generated filenames. This is needed because AMU
can't generate commands longer than 2048 chrs.


15 May 1996

Can exclude certain files from search spec.
Eg
Makatic ... -f "Sources...c.* -x *...Bar.c.*" ...



20 May 1996	2.14

Added Makatic.MultiILink - does an incremental libfile.
Added Makatic.MultiMF.
Added Makatic.CmdFile



23 May 1996	2.15

Makatic2 now strips any dyanmic-dependancies which depend on non-existant
files. Thus removal or renaming of a header file is handled
automatically - the user doesn't have to remove any effected dynamic
dependancies by hand.


29 May 1996	2.16

Makatic2 now only strips non-existent dynamic dependancies if run with
the -D flag. This is a result of profiling Makatic2 - when generating
the new makefile, over 80% of the time was spent in OS_File checking for
the existence of the files.


18 Jun 1996	2.17

Added -V <filename> flag to output objects to file for use with 'link -v
<filename>'. Useful when list of objects is more than 2048 - amu
truncates command lines longer than this; one can now do
'Makatic.Makatic2 -V objs ...' make the link step in the template
makefile be something like '$(LINK) -o $@ -VIA objs $(Librarys)'.

19 Jun 1996

Added Makatic.MultiBSub

Modified Makatic.MultiBSub and Makatic.ILink to use same filenames as
Makatic.Link. Otherwise, libraries can end up with two copies of the
same AOF files, with different names...



01 Jul 1996

Makatic3 - inserts list of files into template makefile, and uses Desk.
Added local -V option to output list of files to file.
Makatic3 was based on earlier version of Makatic2, without -V option in
main call.

Added Large2 - expects the caller to use the '-m' flag, which enables
Makatic flags to be set (for example -D).

08 Aug 1996

Makatic3 inserts only 1 tab at start of each line in replacement text.




17 Oct 1996	2.18

Added help to Makatic3.


09 Dec 1996

Changed CmdFile to print input file contents with puts rather than
printf - printf seemed to fail with long strings (<600 bytes though...).


10 Dec 1996

Added LongObey - runs Obey files with commands>256 chrs (simply sends
each command to system(), so only works for commands that are compatible
with DDEUtils' (any C programs, not 'If' etc).



10 Jan 1997

Adding -ff option to Makatic3 - doesn't indent created text or append
newline. \n, \t and \\ are converted to newline, tab and \.

Makatic3 version 3.01


11 Jan 1997	Makatic3 version3.02

Fixed bug introduced in 3.01 in -f habdling - replacement text wasn't indented.
Fixed bug introduced in 3.01 in handling of -e ensure directory.

13 Jan 1997	Makatic3 modified - was producing incorrect files with
#Makatic{ -V ...
...
#Makatic}


23 Jan 1997

Modified Makatic.LongObey to chain the last command in the input file,
to allow the last command to increase its wimpslot.




Updated !Help to briefly mention Makatic.Makatic3.

14 Feb 1997	2.20

---------------------------------




30 May 1997

Adding '-2' flag to Makatic3 - makes it behave as Makatic2. Replaing
Makatic2 by an obey script which simply calls Makatic3 -2 ...



03 Oct 1997

Makatic3 -2 ignores ./cvs* filenames.



11 Dec 1997

Recompiled Makatic3 with new Desk with bug fix in Filing module - used to
break when enumerating directories with long names.


-- Makatic3 version 3.03 --


22 Dec 1997

_C++ now checks return from *copy command.

_C++ now does the copy by hand - *copy is not good...


23 Dec 1997

Rebuilt Makatic3 to use new replace schem - allows use of #/x.


Wed 25 Mar 1998
MultiILink copes if output file doesn't already exist.

Fri 27 Mar 1998
_C++ ensures 'o' exists.
