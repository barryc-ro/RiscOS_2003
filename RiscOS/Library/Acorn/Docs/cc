Changes since version 5.06 are just the addition
of new warnings and warning suppression flags:

-Ws   suppression of "module has init to static data"
-Wr   suppression _swix format warnings
-Wc   suppression of "use of reserved C++ keyword" warnings
-Wb   suppression of unknown pragma warnings
-Wg   suppression of non-const format parameter warnings
        (..printf, ..scanf, _swix)

The compiler now knows (with #pragma -v4 in swis.h) about _swi
and _swix and will check that the correct number of parameters
have been supplied and that they are of suitable types.

The compiler now identifies *which* function parameter it is 
grumbling about when it has a complaint about one of them.


Changes in version 5.11 of the compiler:

-Ws is assumed and ignored, but not faulted.

-ccversion <version * 100> option is supported.  eg. --ccversion 512
will abort compilation if you aren't using version 5.12 or later.

A new macro __CC_NORCROFT_VERSION with a numeric value equal to the
version number * 100 is predefined.


Changes in version 5.12 of the compiler:

Signed shift right following a bitwise AND with a constant used to do
a logical shift, not arithmetic.  This is now fixed.  (C standard says
that the LSR/ASR choice is implementation defined - and our manual
defines it as ASR)


Full set of active pragmas:

The following comes from cfe/pp.c and maps the long pragma names to
the short versions.  The digit is the value to use with the short
versions to effect the same thing.  (ie. #pragma -v4 is the same
as #pragma check_swix_formats).  Do not use -v3 as it is for
internal use only (by the compiler's own source code).

Debug flags are used with -zq<option>.  Some options are
counted in that repeating them increases the debug level.
Such options are marked with <n> in the list below.  It
is expected that very few people will need to know these
(only people modifying the compiler itself, probably).
Options can be combined in a single flag, eg. -zqvvcka
