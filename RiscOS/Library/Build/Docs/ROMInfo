ROMInfo

This utility is used for determining information about a ROM image.  It will 
output the image type and size and then for each module held in the image, 
the name, description, version, date, size and other comments.  It will also 
output the location in memory of each module if the -loc option is used.  
When the -csv option is used the module information is printed in CSV format.
The whole of the ROM image needs to be loaded into the RAM of the RiscPC 
before analysis takes place so be sure to have at least the image size of 
free memory.  

Usage:	
	ROMInfo [-loc | -csv] <rom image>
        	
Options:
	-loc : print out the position in memory of each module
	-csv : print out the module information in csv format
