The ModGen tool
---------------

ModGen is a tool for creating a Resources module (like the UK Messages module)
from a set of input files and corresponding resource file names.

The format of the ModGen command is:

ModGen <Filename> <Title> <Help> <Version> { <Binary file> <Resource file> |
-via <viafile> }

<Filename> is the filename in which the generared module is to be placed.

<Title> is the module title string. This should consist of ASCII alphanumeric
characters only and should be less than 16 characters long.

<Help> is the modules help string without the version and date information.
This may contain any non control characters including spaces. It should be
less than 16 characters long.

<Version> is the modules version number, this should be of the form V.VV

<Binary file> is the name of a file to be included in the resource file
data.

<Resource file> is the name within the ResourceFS which is used by the
application to refer to a file within the resource file data.

A <viafile> is a file containing a list of <Binary file> <Resource file> pairs
one per line. This may be used for convenience or to circument the 256
character command line length limit.
