ROM Module Splitter 

	This little utility splits up a ROM image into its constituent
modules.
	Each module is saved into an individual file numbered module001,
module002, module003 etcetera according to their position within the ROM.
	If there are more than 78 modules in the ROM, they go into
subdirectories numbered 1, 2, 3 etcetera.

Syntax: ROMUnjoin <ROM image> <dir base>
Flags:
<ROM image> 	The name of the image to be split.
<dir base>	The base directory for the seperate modules to be saved into.
