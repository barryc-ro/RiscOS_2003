This is the RiscOS tools directory hierarchy.  It contains all the tools
required for building RISC OS and its associated paraphernalia.  All the
tools are classified into one of the sub-directories:

Acorn     -  Tools from Desktop C, Acorn C/C++ release 5, and tools that
             are closely related and would have gone in release 6.
ARM       -  ARM Toolkit tools.
Build     -  General utilities required to build RISC OS, including ROM
             build bits and pieces.
DrSmiths  -  Dr Smiths C Development Toolkit.  Contains all the tools
             provided as part of the DSCDT.  Maintained by Julian Smith.
GNU       -  Free Software Foundation tools.
Misc      -  Miscellaneous tools (a handful of legacy tools)
Unix      -  RISC OS versions of common UNIX tools.

New classifications and addition of new tools should be requested through the
Tools group (mailto:cam-toolsgroup@pace.co.uk)

The classifications are prioritised.  All tools which existed in the old
structure are still on the search path which is set up by the !Common file
in RiscOS.Env.  The ARM and GNU directories are NOT on the path and must be
referenced using their classification prefix.  eg. "gnu.gcc", "arm.armasm"


Makefile
--------

The Makefile provides the rule for generating the Binary Build Environment
version of the Library directory.  Currently, it exports everything.  This
probably ought to be looked at.


Documentation
-------------

Each of the sub-directories contains a Docs directory.  This contains 
documentation about each binary in that classification, with the Docs
file using the same leafname as the tool binary.
