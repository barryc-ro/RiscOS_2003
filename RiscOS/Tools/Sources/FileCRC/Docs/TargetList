Target List
===========

	This document outlines the targets available for building this utility.
	
!Mk.
	This is the standard default target

!MkClean
	Use this target to clean the build.

!MkD
	Make a debuglib-enabled version of the utility.

!MkDocs
	Automatically generate documents from the sources.

!MkInstrum
	Builds preprocessed sources from the i directory which have been
instrumented in McCabe. The istrumented utility will be found in
targets.filecrci

!MkMCD
	Builds the utility with DebugLib and MemChecking enabled.

!MkPreproc
	Preprocesses the sources and places them into the i directory.

!MkProd
	Build with PRODUCTION_TEST_BUILD defined. Used to build the utility
with the pre-V2.15 interface.




To build for McCabe
===================
	If you wish to build a McCabe-enabled version of the utility, then
you perform the following stages:
	
	1) Initially clean all the sources. This is not vital, but gives a
known basis for the rest of the process.
	2) Double-click on the !MkPreproc target to make the pre-processed
sources.
	3) Move the preprocessd sources from the i directory to the McCabe machine and instrument them.
	4) Move the instrumented sources *plus* the instlib/c file back to
the i directory
	5) Double-click on the !MkInstrum target to produce an instrumented
executable in the targets directory.
