This directory contains a series of test that can be used to check whether
FileCRC is working correctly. There are two main test harnesses in the form
of taskobey files:

* SimpleTest. this file simply creates a CRC checkfile for a directory structure.
* Test1. This runs a series of tests which test the behaviour of FileCRC. It
includes testing various parts of the fialure behaviour, eg. files that have
incorrect sizes, missing files, incorrect CRC's etcetera.

To use this facility, put the version of FileCRC to be tested into the
'Tests' directory and click on the relevant taskObey file. This is done to
ensure that the version being tested is the version you want to be tested and
not the one on hte library path.
