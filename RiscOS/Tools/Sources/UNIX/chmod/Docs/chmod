chmod
=====

This tool provides the same sort of functionality as the UNIX tool of the
same name: namely to change the access permissions on files and directories
as per a specification provided on the command-line.

Syntax: chmod [-R] [-v] [-d] <op spec> file ...

-R means operate recursively
-v means verbose mode - show names of files as changes are made
-d means debug mode - show lots of internal debugging data

file ... is one or more space-separated filenames.  Wildcards are allowed
in the last component of a name only.  They are faulted elsewhere.

op spec is the specification of the changes to be made.  See the chmod manual
page for more details (chmod.1 with this document).  You can specify absolute
permissions in octal or use symbolic form.  This must only be one argument. 
Comma separate multiple specs as shown below.

Group permissions are ignored.  User permissions affect the Locked, user read
and write attributes; Other permissions affect public read and write
attributes.  Use = to set, - to clear and + to add permissions.  Use u+t to
lock, u-t to unlock.

e.g.

op spec            Permissions (file)   Permissions (dir)

000                /                    /
020                W/                   /
400                R/                   /
500                R/                   /
600                WR/                  /
700                WR/                  /
701                WR/                  /R
702                WR/W                 /W
703                WR/W                 /WR
704                WR/R                 /
705                WR/R                 /R

u=rw,o=            WR/                  /
a=                 /                    /
u+t                L bit set            L bit set
u=rwt              LWR set              L bit set
+X                 (unchanged)          /R bit set

The setuid bit is ignored (ie. u+s).



Future versions may take advantage of the backdoor in the NFS module to
send UNIX permissions directly to remote NFS mounts if possible.
