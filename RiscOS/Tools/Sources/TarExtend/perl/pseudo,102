# File:        filecmp (pseudo)
# Description: Compares two files, reporting entries which exist in
#              one file, but not in the other.  The check works both ways, 
#              on both files.  
# Assumptions: a) Typical file format as follows:
#                 a 03-08.!Builder.!Boot, 55 bytes, 1 block
#                 a 03-08.!Builder.!Help, 2080 bytes, 5 blocks
#                 x 03-08.!Builder.!Boot, 55 bytes, 1 block
#              b) Single file does not contain duplicate entries.
#              c) Files do not contain blank lines.
#              d) Files are extracted in the same order that they were
#                 archived, although of course, files may be missing.
# ToDo:        a) If the files being compared are radically different from
#                 each other, we'll eventually run out of memory.  Handle
#                 this cleanly.  
# History:     10-Feb-1999  SR  Created.
#              11-Feb-1999  SR  Algorithm verified against test cases.

Anything left in listA is missing from file2.
Anything left in listB is missing from file1.
