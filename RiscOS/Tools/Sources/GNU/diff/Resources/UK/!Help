  Gnu Diff
  ========

  Purpose: To compare two files for differences.

  Setup:

    Icon                        Action/Meaning
    ----                        --------------

    Path1                       First file to be compared (old file)
    Path2                       Second file to be compared (new file)

    Context                     Context style output
    Unified                     Unified context output
    Ifdef                       Merged output with changes marked by
                                #ifdef TAG lines (TAG from the next box)
    RCS                         RCS style output
    Ed script                   Editor script for changing old to new
    Reverse ed                  Ed-like output, with lines in file order
    Summary                     Summary output, only reporting changed files

    Report identical            Report identical files
    Recursive                   Search subdirectories in directory search

    Menu                        Action/Meaning
    ----                        --------------

    Expand tabs                 Expand tabs in the output
    Force comparison            Compare even if files appear to be binary
    Minimal changes             Guaranteed minimal set of changes (slower)
    Speed up large files        Use heuristics to speed comparison
    Missing file is empty       In directory searches, treat missing files
                                as empty

    File label                  Use the given labels in the context header
    Lines of context            Number of lines of context to give
    Context header              Write lines matching this regex as headers

    Ignore case                 Ignore differences in case
    Ignore blank lines          Ignore blank lines when comparing
    Ignore changes in space     Ignore changes in whitespace when comparing
    Ignore all space            Ignore all whitespace when comparing
    Ignore regex                Ignore lines matching the given regex


  If the paths specified are filenames, those files are compared. If one
  of the paths is a directory, it is searched for a file with the same
  name as the other file. If both paths are directories, all files in the
  directories are compared (matching files with the same name, and reporting
  files which do not exist in both directories).
