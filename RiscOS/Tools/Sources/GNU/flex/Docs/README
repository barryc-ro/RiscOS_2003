This is a tool which uses itself to build itself.  It also uses the
bison tool to help.  However, this causes a certain circularity problem!

The Makefile will arrange for the pre-generated code to be compiled to
make a bootstrap version, then it will use this to generate scan.c which
is then compiled to give the final proper version.

This tool requires the bison tool to have been built and installed first.
