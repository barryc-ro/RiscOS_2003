Note that cfront doesn't build itself correctly unless it is using cc410.
Therefore use !Before and !After around a build to set an alias
appropriately. More automated methods in the build were considered but not
implemented due to the danger of the alias being left set unnoticed if there
were any problems.

Note that the c++ frontend tool in the cmd directory here is no longer
used and has been superseded by the one in Tools/Sources/c++cmd.

------------------

The above information regarding !Before and !After is no longer relevant
as cfront will build with later versions of the compiler provided that
the CSE optimiser is disabled (the -zpz0 switch on CPPFLAGS)
