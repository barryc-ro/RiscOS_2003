2  Requirements


2.1  A working knowledge of RISC OS and the Acorn Desktop Development
     Environment and ANSI C Release 4.

2.2  A suitable RISC OS computer (eg an A440 running RISC OS 2.00, or an
     A5000 running RISC OS 3.00).

2.3  Acorn Desktop C (Product code SKB75) which includes the following discs:

        - Installation Disc    -  part no. 0270,521
        - Boot Disc            -  part no. 0270,523
        - Work Disc            -  part no. 0270,525
        - Reference Disc       -  part no. 0270,527

2.4  Printer Driver Release 2 disc, part no. 0270,824-01: this is the master
     for the !SysMerge utility. 

2.5  SCSI/CDROM Utils disc, part no. 0273,380-01: this is the master for the
     ScsiDM utility.



3  Procedure


3.1  Install Acorn Desktop C onto the hard disc of your computer using the
     !Install application on the Installation Disc.

3.2  Copy the contents of the ISOFORM Source disc (ie this disc: part no.
     0284,081/DR) to a directory ISO on your hard disc.

3.3  The file called "makeiso" in ISO is the makefile for the ISOFORM
     project, and contains a number of targets. Double-click on this file to
     make the "ISOForm" target, creating a new file called "ISOForm" in the
     ISO directory.

3.4  Create a directory called ISOFORM on your hard disc: the contents of the
     ISOFORM Disc will be rebuilt inside this directory.

3.5  Copy the following items from the ISO directory to the ISOFORM
     directory:

         - !ISOForm
         - ISOForm

3.6  Copy the following files from the sub-directory ISO.misc to the ISOFORM
     directory (at the top level):

         - ReadMe1st
         - RelNote
         - manual
         - MSDOS-Mods

3.7  Copy the file "ISOForm" from ISOFORM to ISOFORM.!ISOForm and rename as
     !RunImage.

3.8  Copy !System from the Acorn Desktop C Boot Disc (part no. 0270,523) to
     ISOFORM.

3.9  Delete the following files from ISOFORM.!System.Modules:
  
         - Colours
         - DDEUtils
         - DDT

3.10 Copy !SysMerge from the Printer Driver Release 2 disc (part no.
     0270,824) to ISOFORM.

3.11 Copy ScsiDM from the SCSI/CDROM Utils disc (part no. 0273,380) to
     ISOFORM.


The ISOFORM directory should now contain a copy of the files on the ISOFORM
Disc part no. 0284,081 as follows:

            !ISOForm
              !Boot
              !Help
              !Run
              !RunImage
              !Sprites
              Desc
              Messages
              Templates
            !SysMerge
              !Help
              !Run
              !RunImage
              !Sprites
              Templates
            !System
              !Boot
              !Run
              !Sprites
              modules
                CLib
                FPEmulator
                FrontEnd
                Task
            ISOForm
            manual
            ReadMe1st
            RelNote
            ScsiDM



4  Additional notes


The makefile "makeiso" includes further targets as detailed below; these may
be useful if further development of the product takes place, and more
information can be found in the ISOFORM PST Report (part no. 0384,080/SQ)
and in the corresponding source files themselves.

  test1     -  for testing the "toscsi" interface
  test2     -  for testing the "tofile" interface
  test3     -  for testing formatter options processing
  test4     -  for testing file copying
  test5     -  tests get_datestamp
  test6     -  special tests for read_RISCOS_dir
  compare   -  compares two directory hierarchies in detail
  eximage   -  examines an ISO image held in a file or on a SCSI disc
