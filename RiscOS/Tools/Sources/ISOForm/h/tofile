/*
  This interface provides functions to validate a request to output an image
  to a file, and to handle sequential output of that image.

  Typical use is as follows:

    << first check that it's possible to open the file >>

     if (tofile_validate(char *filename) < 0) ...

    << now write out the image block by block >>

     tofile_open_image();

     { buff = tofile_next_image_block();
       << copy the next image block into buff >>
     }

     tofile_image_close();
