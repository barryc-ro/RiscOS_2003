#
# Test Makefile for amu which tests precedence of macro definitions.  Macros
# can be defined from the environment, the CLI or the Makefile itself.
#
# Default precedence is:       CLI, Makefile, Environment.
# -E changes precedence to:    Makefile, CLI, Environment.
# -e changes precedence to:    CLI, Environment, Makefile.
# -e -E changes precedence to: Makefile, Environment, CLI.
#
# The 'override' keyword demotes CLI to after Makefile.
#
# Try invoking this Makefile with the following tests:
#
# *unset MACRO
# amu                     (should output Makefile)
# amu MACRO=CLI           (should output CLI)
# amu -E                  (should output Makefile)
# amu -e                  (should output Makefile)
# amu -e MACRO=CLI        (should output CLI)
# amu -E MACRO=CLI        (should output Makefile)
# amu -E -e MACRO=CLI     (should output Makefile)
# *set MACRO Environment
# amu                     (should output Makefile)
# amu MACRO=CLI           (should output CLI)
# amu -E                  (should output Makefile)
# amu -e                  (should output Environment)
# amu -e MACRO=CLI        (should output CLI)
# amu -E MACRO=CLI        (should output Makefile)
# amu -E -e MACRO=CLI     (should output Makefile)

# *set FOO Environment
# amu foo                 (should output Makefile)
# amu foo -e              (should output Makefile)
# amu foo -E              (should output Makefile)
# amu foo -e -E           (should output Makefile)
# amu foo FOO=CLI         (should output Makefile)
# amu foo -e FOO=CLI      (should output Environment)
# amu foo -E  FOO=CLI     (should output Makefile)
# amu foo -e -E FOO=CLI   (should output Environment)

# *set BAR Environment
# amu bar -E              (should output Environment)
# amu bar -E BAR=CLI      (should output CLI)
# amu bar -E -e BAR=CLI   (should output Environment)
