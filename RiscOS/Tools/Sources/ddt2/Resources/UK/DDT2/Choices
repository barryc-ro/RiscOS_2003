# User-configurable choices
# =========================
#
# These may not be freely internationalised - the values of the tokens,
# where strings, are compared directly inside the debugger. Since the user
# should edit this through a dialogue, it is that dialogue's contents which
# should be internationalised. Changing the values here to foreign ones
# requires the code to be appropriately altered and recompiled.

# If any items appear below, the Choices file being maintained wherever
# the debugger is saving it to (e.g. <Choices$Write>) has become out of date
# compared with the default Choices file inside the application directory.
# The items below have been added to that default Choices file, and so have
# been appended to this working copy as well.
