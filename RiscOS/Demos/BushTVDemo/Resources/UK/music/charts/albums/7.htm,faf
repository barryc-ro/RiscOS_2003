<TD VALIGN="top">Though there is something fairly unhealthy (and unconvincing) about 32-year old Kylie's skimpily-clad jiggy business down the disco, and she's clearly not going to evolve into a fully-grown pop goddess like Madonna, there's also something very <I>good</I> about her latest records. And Light Years is probably the most <I>consistently</I> good so far. The songs are all instant hits and top class pop at its most powerful and there are also several moments of absolute genius. There's the Robbie duet Kids, the retro-disco of Koocachoo, the take-that-Steps stomp of Disco Down (a song that could only have been improved had it been a cover of the Shed 7 song of the same name) and the truly triumph kitsch call to arms that is Your Disco Needs You (another Robbie co-composition). Even without those moments, this is still an accomplished album of anthems and rather more knowing pop tunes, which nod back and forth between classic moves and future grooves. While she still seems to be doing much the same thing stylistically, Light Years shows her doing it so much <I>better</I> than before and providing far more exotic, ambitious and involving listening without confusing anyone. And that's where Kylie's true talent lies. At last she seems to have discovered and developed it.<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="-2" COLOR="#666666"><I>By Esther Sadler<</I></FONT>
