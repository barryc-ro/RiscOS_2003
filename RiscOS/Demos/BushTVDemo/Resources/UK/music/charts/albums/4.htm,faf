<TD VALIGN="top">She truly is the queen of pop. Despite the hype, Madonna's greatest and best achievement throughout her colourful career is her consistent command of the power of pop music. And she knows this too. So despite all the "controversy" generated by the tabloid-tastic antics of her very public private life we'll all have her songs in our heads to tell us the only really important stuff about her as an artist. The revelations and rumours fade, but the songs remain fresh and vital up to fifteen or so years on. Thus Music is another seemingly effortless, though rewardingly hard worked for triumph. Madonna just seems to be getting cooler and cooler. The pop trash and squeaky vocals of Holiday, Material Girl and Get Into The Groove have evolved into the fully-developed vocal female who commands the music and the trendy electronics on songs like Paradise (Not For Me), Music and Runaway Lover. This is a consistently enticing album of mature pop magic of both cutting edge modern pop and enduring classic tunes. Madonna has been consistently been underrated both as a singer and songwriter, but now she's got this much better at both bits and capitalised so completely on her early prodigious promise, she's really ready to command the world of pop. Long may she reign.
