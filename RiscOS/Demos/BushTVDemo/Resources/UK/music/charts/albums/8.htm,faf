<TD VALIGN="top">With a twinkle in his eye and a song in his heart post-teen idol Ronan Keating, comes gently rocking along the highway with the summer wind in his golden hair. And, er, that's it really. However, he's invested too many of his resources in the Big Corporate Power Ballad Shop. (And we're talking power ballad in a couple of senses of the term here, for, as well as the big, blustering choruses Ronan has also got some of the biggest writers in the business (Diane Warren, Bryan Adams, the bloke out of the New Radicals) in his pocket.) Which is odd and sad seeing as recent non-soppy single Rollercoaster proved at a (master)stroke that he could do something considerably more invigorating than limply tug on a few heartstrings. There are other highlights here (Heal Me, If You Love Me, Addicted, but none soar as high as Rollercoaster and much of this is very wet indeed (In This Life, When You Say Nothing At All, Only For You, which last sins doubly with its diddly Irish pipes). And there is simply no excuse for a) inviting Bryan Adams to a) write you one song for your solo debut and then b) attempting to become him for most of the rest of the record. An ominous augury. <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="-2" COLOR="#666666"><I>By Esther Sadler</I></FONT>
