<TD VALIGN="top">It's been three years since the last Paul Simon album, Songs From The Capeman, the tie-in disc to his critically-lambasted and commercially-unsuccessful attempt at a Broadway musical. But there's something about Simon, his smart-arse wit, his way with a needlessly-complicated rhythm, and his easy gift for melody that ensures eternal failure to fail. Twenty years before Capeman, his stab at film-directing, One Trick Pony, was a nearly equal disaster, but he followed it with the remarkable Hearts & Bones. You're The One is neither as back-to-basics nor as brilliant, but it has many moments. The title-track is a particular delight, from its great opening "May twelve angels guard you/ While you sleep/ Maybe that's a waste of angels/ I don't know" to its bouncy, brass-boosted, chorus. Equally, Darling Lorraine is a gem, teasingly slinking along with a winding melody and casual, slangy love-story-based lyrics. Throughout, You're The One is inflected with hints of many musics, from folk to township, doo-wop to Brazilian, which makes for a varied collection of songs, but also prevents this from being as cohesive or as inventive as his best discs. But, it's certainly better for sixty-year-old Simon to have dished up a smorgasbord of many delectable flavours than a half-baked attempt at being hip. And there's a curious thing about musical travellers such as Simon - the more they take in the rest of the world, the more they sound like themselves. As he sagely sings "All my life I've been a wanderer/ Not really, I mostly lived near my parents' home". <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="-2" COLOR="#666666"><I>By Toby Smith</I></FONT>
