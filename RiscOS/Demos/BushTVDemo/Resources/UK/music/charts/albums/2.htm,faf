<TD VALIGN="top">When Robbie Williams announces with typical gusto: "I don't want to be unfamous
now", you realise that this is just as well as he's not going to have much choice in the matter
for a while yet. In truth, both his previous albums haven't made much of
an attempt to spiral away from the flip, hip pop that he does so well,
but as his onetime buddies Oasis have proved, if something's fixed, why
bother trying to break it. Sing When You're Winning is therefore pretty
much what you'd expect, further honing Williams' vaudevillian panache. It's no mere
coincidence that the hit single Rock DJ leans heavily on the synthy squelch
of Relax by Frankie Goes To Hollywood, pop's last
roar-of-the-greasepaint troupers. The album determinedly has a little
something for everyone: glam metal on Kids (where he duets with Kylie)
and Let Love Be Your Energy; wistful balladeering on If It's Hurting You
(a thinly veiled observation on post-Nic life) and the Angels-in-waiting
Better Man. There's even, courtesy of Supreme, a song that sounds
marvellously like one of Scott Walker's loucher moments. A smart record
in every sense of the word, with co-writer Guy Chambers' contribution as
vital as ever. And Williams even manages, with By All Means Necessary, to
prove that he could get a lot more complicated if he wanted to. No wonder he's singing when he's winning as easily as this.<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="-2" COLOR="#666666"><I>By Paul Mathur</I></FONT>
