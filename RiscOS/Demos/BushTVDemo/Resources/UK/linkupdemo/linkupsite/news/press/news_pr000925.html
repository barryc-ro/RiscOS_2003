<tr><td><h1>LinkUp Systems L7200 system on chip now supported by Mentor Graphics VRTx operating system</h1>

<p><b><i>Development Platform for Wireless Internet and Consumer Electronics OEMs to include Processor, Peripheral Devices and Operating System</i></b>
<p>SANTA CLARA, Calif. - Sept 25, 2000 - LinkUp Systems Corp. and Mentor Graphics Corporation (NASDAQ: MENT) today announced that the Mentor Graphics® VRTX® Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) supports the LinkUp L7200 System Development Board.
<p>LinkUp Systems L7200 family of processors are multi-functional devices, incorporating an ARM720Tä CPU core, an integrated DSP, key peripherals and several serial interfaces on a single System-on-Chip (SoC). The small hardware footprint of the L7200 architecture, combined with the memory-efficient VRTX RTOS, form an ideal solution for SoC-based Internet Appliance applications such as Pocket PCs, Web phones, wireless Internet terminals and smart cellular phones. The addition of VRTX support for the L7200 provides system designers with a high-reliability, pre-ported and configured RTOS, enabling immediate software application development on the L7200 System Development Board (L7200SDB).
<p>"Mentor Graphics, with their VRTX RTOS, is an ideal development partner for LinkUp Systems," said Ravi Bhatnagar, president and CEO of LinkUp Systems.  "Together, our companies can offer systems designers a complete OEM solution including an embedded OS, a highly integrated system-on-chip, a complete development environment and reference platforms."
<p>"VRTX support for the LinkUp Systems L7200 development board provides system designers with the embedded industry's most reliable and highest performance real-time operating system solution for next-generation wireless Internet appliances and communications devices," said Michael Kaskowitz, vice president and general manager of the Embedded Software Division of Mentor Graphics. "The availability of the L7200 development board with the VRTX OS provides OEM customers of both companies with a complete development solution to create reliable, market-ready SoCs for the explosive Internet Appliance market."
