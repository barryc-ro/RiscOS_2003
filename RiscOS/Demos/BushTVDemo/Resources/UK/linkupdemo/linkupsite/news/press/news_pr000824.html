<tr><td><h1>LinkUp Systems Joins ARM Partnership, Licenses ARM720T Technology from ARM</h1>

<p>SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 24, 2000--
License to Enable LinkUp to Provide Innovative Processor Plus Peripherals Solutions for Internet Appliances, Mobile Applications 
     <p>LinkUp Systems Corporation today announced that it has joined the ARM Partnership and licensed the ARM720T(R) CPU core from ARM
(Nasdaq:ARMHY)(LSE:ARM), the industry's leading provider of 16/32-bit embedded RISC microprocessor solutions. LinkUp will embed the ARM720T core
in its next generation of system-on-chip (SoC) solutions targeted at the fast-growing Internet and mobile markets.

     <p>The agreement will expand LinkUp's product portfolio, enabling the company to provide a wide range of customers with a complete processor plus
peripherals solution on a single chip. LinkUp Systems will leverage its design experience with the high-performance, low-power ARM(R) architecture to create
innovative single-chip solutions with highly-integrated system peripherals. These on-chip peripherals include LCD and memory control, USB and Bluetooth
connectivity and access to industry-standard storage options.

<p>LinkUp Systems offers reference designs for popular Internet appliances such as Pocket PCs, Set-Top-Boxes, Web phones and Web Pads, speeding
customer time to market. The company's ARM core-based L7200 family of processor plus peripherals solutions also supports leading embedded operating
systems, such as Microsoft Windows CE, Symbian EPOC, Linux, Wind River Systems VxWorks, and the ATI Nucleus OS.

<p>"As a long-time ARM developer, LinkUp Systems is delighted to join the leading lights of the semiconductor world as an ARM partner," said Ravi Bhatnagar,
President and CEO of LinkUp Systems. "With this new ARM720T core license, LinkUp will be able to position itself as a premier supplier of ARM core-based
system-on-a-chip solutions for a very wide range of system applications."

<p>"This agreement further strengthens the momentum of the ARM architecture as the microprocessor of choice for the digital world," said Reynette Au, Vice
President of Worldwide Marketing at ARM. "By taking this license, LinkUp Systems will be able to seamlessly integrate the high-performance, low-power
ARM720T core with industry-proven peripherals, to create a full range of innovative Internet-enabled information appliances."

<p>LinkUp Systems is using the newly licensed ARM720T microprocessor core in system-on-a-chip devices using the latest 0.18 process technology. The power
conservation features of the new device and the 1.8V process make these devices particularly well suited for mobile use. These products will address the next
generation of smart cellphones using packet-based air interface standards such as GPRS and EDGE, as well as to create WAP-enabled phones.

<p>LinkUp provides complete Integrated Development Environment (IDE) including the software tool kit, Multi-ICE(TM) support, and development system.
