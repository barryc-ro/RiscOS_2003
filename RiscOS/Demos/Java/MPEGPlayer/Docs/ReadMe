------------------------------
Robert Dyke 14/4/99

Files:

In the top level of this directory are all the class files needed to run
the MPEG interface. The html file containing the applet tag is MPEGInterface.html.
To run the interface, this file should be opened by the browser.
Various parameters are specified (see page source and getParameterInfo()).

The details of the class file are:

  MPEGInterface - this is the the applet
  Graphic - the class provides the component Graphic used by the interface
  DisappearingGraphic - this class provides the component DisappearingGraphic
                        used by the interface
  InformationWindow - this class provides the component InformationWindow
                      used by the interface
  Icon - the class provides the component Icon used by the interface
  IconGroup - used to facilitate the radio-button behaviour of icons
  
Directories:

  com/acorn/MPEG - the package com.acorn.MPEG
  control_images - contains the images used for the control panel
  doc            - contains javadoc information
  images         - contains other images used by the interface
  spec           - contains the full design specification
  src            - contains all the .java files
  testIR         - contains a test applet used to check IR operation
  
NOTES
-----
  1. The applet can take a while to load - on the STB I used during testing
  the load time was approximately 45secs.
  
  2. The information window component does not work as intended on the STB.
  This is not a major problem because the information window runs too slow
  when playing a MPEG. Currently no information is displayed when playing an
  MPEG and an empty box is displayed when not.
  
  3. The applet will not respond to any inputs from the IR until it has been
  clicked on by the mouse. For example, pressing the 'Options' button on the IR
  when the applet has not been clicked on will bring up the options bar provided
  by the STB. Pressing the 'Options' button after clicking inside the applet will
  bring up the applet's control panel.
