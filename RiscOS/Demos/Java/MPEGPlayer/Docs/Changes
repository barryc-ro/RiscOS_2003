=======================
Robert Dyke 16/4/99

This file details the changes made to the baseline.

A directory called interface has been created its path is:

	NFS::NB2.$.baseline.Content.HTML.Demo.interface
	
This directory contains all the files needed to run the MPEGInterface, plus
the source code and javadoc information. The files contained in this top level
directory are the .class files and the html file. I have also added the following
documents:

	ReadMe	- general information
	Changes (this document)
	Handset	- details of the handset buttons used
	Depend  - all the dependancies
	
Other directories:

	com		- contains the MPEG api
	control_images	- contains the images for the control panel
	doc		- javadoc information
	images		- the other images (i.e. the intro graphic)
	spec		- contains the full design spec
	scr		- contains the source code
	testIR		- contains an applet used to test the codes sent by the IR
	
Other changes:

The html file 'NFS::NB2.$.baseline.Content.HTML.Demo.welcome/html' has been
modified to provide links to the two applets (MPEGInterface and TestIR). The
section added has been commented <! Added by Robert Dyke 13/4/99> at the start
and <! end of 13/4/99> at the end.
