Dependancies
============
Robert Dyke 16/4/99

This file describes the dependancies of the interface.

1. In order to play a stream the applet uses a StreamController object. The applet
also implements an MPEGListener. These classes are provided by the package
com.acorn.MPEG. Without these classes available the applet will not function.

2. The applet looks for various images specified as parameters in the html file.
The applet will continue to operate if it can not find the images. For example if
the applet fails to find the image used for the play icon, a blank component will
result.
