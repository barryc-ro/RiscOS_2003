General Notes
-------------


Modem module currently supports V90 connections, not V92.

Sources.!Mk makes rm.CtrlsModem ... there are a few warnings generated during the build... these are lucent software bits... don't worry about them.

Add PODULEBASED to the makefile c flags if you want a new podule based module.  I have left the makefile set to create ALBA2 versions of the module.

All the riscoos interface lives in riscos.c (riscosutil.c contains glue functions to the modem software).  I suspect the interrupt setup bits in riscos.c module_initialise and finalise routines may require a little tweaking.

The module currently spews debug to !listdebug.

The modem polling routine speed can be changed from the default 5 centiseconds (you may need to change this, the default is set as macro "PollPeriod" at the top of riscos.c) using "*ModemPollPeriod" (pollperiods of greater than 5 or 6 cs break V90 handshake process on my riscpc.  "*modemstats" may prove useful too.

The modem starts when you open the device and stops polling when you close it again... it doesn't currently drop the line on closeing the device... useful with PPP setup.

I am off to scotland for the weekend, so I shall be out of the office on friday.  I am likely to be contactable (Friday) on xxxxxxxxx.
