Issue: Does the kernel set up the mapping (note that this is a reserved
address range, but without RAM mapped into it), or does the PCI manager do
it. Can the PCI Manager do it - does the kernel export enough assistance ?
Outcome of discussion was that kernel should detect PCI hardware presence,
map appropriately, export this information using ReadSysInfo, and the PCI
Manager should use that to determine whether to run or go dormant.
[ WTurner to amend spec to reflect relevant aspects (including dependency
upon kernel ]
[ MStephens to ensure the kernel aspects are covered in another spec - either
one covering kernel changes, or miscellaneous changes ]
