I'm hoping you can help us with a slight query we have on
the PCI9080 chip...

In our system, the aim is to be able to use standard PCI cards
from within our own local address space. To achieve this, we
obviously need to map one or more segments of the PCI address space
into our local address space. This is additionally complicated by the
fact that we need to map PCI IO space into our memory map too, as 
we don't have I/O space on our architecture.

As can be seen in the diagram below, our current plan is to map
the IO areas into PCI address space 256MB+, and Memory-mapped areas
into PCI address space 0-256MB, using the base address registers on the
PCI cards.


    Local address space				PCI address space

   4GB +-----------+				|           |
       |           |                            |-----------|
       |           |                            | I/O areas |
       |           |128MB        +=======+      +-----------+ 256MB
       |           |             |PCI9080|      |           |
       |           |             +=======+      |           |
3.75MB +-----------+                            |-----------|
       |           |                            | Mem areas |
       |           |                            +-----------+ 0MB
       
       
Then, the intention is to map:

Local->PCI IO access:  3.75GB(local) => 256MB(PCI), size 128MB
Local->PCI mem access: 3.75GB(local) => 0MB(PCI), size 128MB

Obviously, if we had 1MB of IO space mapped in at 256MB(PCI), and
2MB memory mapped in at 0MB(PCI), this would cause conlicts. It is
intended to avoid these at map-time, resulting (in this case) with
the memory mapped at 0MB(PCI), and the IO mapped at 258MB(PCI), thus
removing the overlap.

However, it isn't clear from the documentation we have whether the PCI9080
chip can doubly-map IO and memory areas in this fashion, in which case,
is the only alternative to split the 128MB(local) into two distinct areas,
one for memory and one for IO (probably 64MB each)?

Thanks for your help, and sorry if this is a bit disorganised/confusing!
