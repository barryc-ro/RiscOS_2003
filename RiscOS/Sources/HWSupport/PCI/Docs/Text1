Initially

Set up the PCI9080 as necessary, mapping the 128MB of RiscOS memory onto
the PCI address space. This is still waiting for confirmation from the
9080 tech support as to how we map IO and memory spaces.

Prod the PCI config spaces on slots 0-2 such that the base address registers
return us the memory size required, and remember what we've read.

Process the base address gubbins to map the chunks into a contiguous block
(or as close as possible) in PCI space
