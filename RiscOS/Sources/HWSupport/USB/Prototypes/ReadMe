The Prototype USB drivers in this directory sit directly on an OHCI
controller and talk to the relevant devices.

ProtoUMouse is a mouse driver.
ProtoUKey is a keyboard driver.
ProtoUComb is a combined keyboard and mouse driver for keyboards with a mouse
interface as well (the mouse plugs into the keyboard).

They were tested on a Belkin keyboard and mouse.

ProtoUPrint supplies a devicefs device which supports bulk transfers.  This
can be used for printing to, and has been tested with the LexmarkZ12 and the
Canon 2100.

ProtOHCI is a prototype for the dynamically created DeviceFS entries which
reads complete descriptors from devices and sends a service call for drivers
to latch onto the driver.  The format of the data sent in the service call
can be seen in the source.
