Service_Standby (Service Call &AD)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This service call is identical to the one in NCOS (where it is instead issued
by the Standby module). It serves as notification that the standby state has
changed.

On entry
        R0 = state flags (identical to <STB$StandbyPressed> )
                Bit     Meaning when set
                0       now in standby mode
                1-31    reserved, should be ignored
        R1 = &AD (reason code)
On exit
        R1 preserved (service call must not be claimed)
