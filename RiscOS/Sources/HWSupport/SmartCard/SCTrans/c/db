 * Modification History
 *---------------------
 *
 *
 * Getting debug data from the SCTransport module can be difficult. As far as I know, nobody as successully
 * used DebugLib - debugging to a disc file fails to write all of the data; debugging to the parallel port
 * causes the Smart Card reading to fail and debugging to a stream isn't possible as the stream cannot be
 * opened until the Internet connection has been made. My solution was to use my own debug library which
 * writes debug text to a buffer and saves the buffer atexit.
 *
 * My solution was to use the pmsdebug routines which write to a memory buffer which is dumped to a Zip
 * disc file atexit. This is enabled in the pmsdebug.h header file.
