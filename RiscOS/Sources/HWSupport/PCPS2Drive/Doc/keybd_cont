%	Port Mode		  Description

	64h  read   8042 status register. Can be read at any time.  See
		    table above for more information.
	64h  write  8042 command register.  Writing this port sets Bit 3
		    of the status register to 1 and the byte is treated
		    as a controller command.  Devices attached to the
		    8042 should be disabled before issuing commands that
		    return data since data in the output register will
		    be overwritten.
	60h  read   8042 output register (should only be read if Bit 0 of
		    status port is set to 1)
	60h  write  8042 data register.  Data should only be written if
		    Bit 1 of the status register is zero (register is empty).
		    When this port is written Bit 3 of the status register
		    is set to zero and the byte is treated as a data.  The
		    8042 uses this byte if it's expecting data for a previous
		    command, otherwise the data is written directly to the
		    keyboard.	See ~KEYBOARD COMMANDS~ for information on
		    programming the actual keyboard hardware.

^Keyboard Commands & Responses

^Commands System Issues to Keyboard (via 8042 port 60h)

	ED  Set/Reset Mode Indicators, keyboard responds with ACK then
	    waits for a following option byte.	When the option byte is
	    received the keyboard again ACK's and then sets the LED's
	    accordingly.  Scanning is resumed if scanning was enabled.
	    If another command is received instead of the option byte
	    (high bit set on) this command is terminated.  Hardware
	    defaults to these indicators turned off.

	    7-3210 Keyboard Status Indicator Option Byte
	          +--- Scroll-Lock indicator  (0=off, 1=on)
	         +---- Num-Lock indicator  (0=off, 1=on)
	        +----- Caps-Lock indicator  (0=off, 1=on)
	      +------- reserved (must be zero)

	EE  Diagnostic Echo, keyboard echoes the EE byte back to the system
	    without an acknowledgement.
	F0  PS/2 Select/Read Alternate Scan Code Sets, instructs keyboard
	    to use one of the three make/break scan code sets.	 Keyboard
	    responds by clearing the output buffer/typematic key and then
	    transmits an ACK.  The system must follow up by sending an
	    option byte which will again be ACK'ed by the keyboard:

	      00  return byte indicating scan code set in use
	      01  select scan code set 1  (used on PC & XT)
	      02  select scan code set 2
	      03  select scan code set 3

	F2  PS/2 Read Keyboard ID, keyboard responds with an ACK and a two
	    byte keyboard ID of 83AB.
	F3  Set Typematic Rate/Delay, keyboard responds with ACK and waits
	    for rate/delay byte.   Upon receipt of the rate/delay byte the
	    keyboard responds with an ACK, then sets the new typematic
	    values and scanning continues if scanning was enabled.
	    
	    76543210  Typematic Rate/Delay Option Byte
	        +-+-+-+-+---- typematic rate indicator (see ~INT 16,3~)
	          +------- A in period formula (see below)
	        +---------- B is period formula (see below)
	      +------------- typematic delay
	     +-------------- always zero

	    delay = (rate+1) * 250   (in milliseconds)
	    rate = (8+A) * (2**B) * 4.17  (in seconds,  20%)

	    Defaults to 10.9 characters per second and a 500ms delay.  If a
	    command byte (byte with high bit set) is received instead of an
	    option byte this command is cancelled.
	F4  Enable Keyboard, cause the keyboard to clear its output buffer
	    and last typematic key and then respond with an ACK.  The
	    keyboard then begins scanning.
	F5  Default w/Disable, resets keyboard to power-on condition by
	    clearing the output buffer, resetting typematic rate/delay,
	    resetting last typematic key and setting default key types.
	    The keyboard responds with an ACK and waits for the next
	    instruction.
	F6  Set Default, resets to power-on condition by clearing the output
	    buffer, resetting typematic rate/delay and last typematic key
	    and sets default key types.  The keyboard responds with an ACK
	    and continues scanning.
	F7  PS/2 Set All Keys to Typematic, keyboard responds by sending an
	    ACK, clearing its output buffer and setting the key type to
	    Typematic.	 Scanning continues if scanning was enabled.  This
	    command may be sent while using any Scan Code Set but only has
	    effect when Scan Code Set 3 is in use.
	F8  PS/2 Set All Keys to Make/Break, keyboard responds by sending an
	    ACK, clearing its output buffer and setting the key type to
	    Make/Break.  Scanning continues if scanning was enabled.  This
	    command may be sent while using any Scan Code Set but only has
	    effect when Scan Code Set 3 is in use.
	F9  PS/2 Set All Keys to Make, keyboard responds by sending an ACK,
	    clearing its output buffer and setting the key type to Make.
	    Scanning continues if scanning was enabled.  This command may
	    be sent while using any Scan Code Set but only has effect when
	    Scan Code Set 3 is in use.
	FA  PS/2 Set All Keys to Typematic Make/Break, keyboard responds by
	    sending an ACK, clearing its output buffer and setting the key
	    type to Typematic Make/Break.  Scanning continues if scanning
	    was enabled.  This command may be sent while using any Scan Code
	    Set but only has effect when Scan Code Set 3 is in use.
	FB  PS/2 Set Key Type to Typematic, keyboard responds by sending an
	    ACK, clearing its output buffer and then waiting for the key ID
	    (make code from Scan Code Set 3).  The specified key type is then
	    set to typematic.	This command may be sent while using any
	    Scan Code Set but only has effect when Scan Code Set 3 is in use.
	FC  PS/2 Set Key Type to Make/Break, keyboard responds by sending an
	    ACK, clearing its output buffer and then waiting for the key ID
	    (make code from Scan Code Set 3).  The specified key type is then
	    set to Make/Break.	 This command may be sent while using any Scan
	    Code Set but only has effect when Scan Code Set 3 is in use.
	FD  PS/2 Set Key Type to Make, keyboard responds by sending an ACK,
	    clearing its output buffer and then waiting for the key ID (make
	    code from Scan Code Set 3).  The specified key type is then set
	    to Make.  This command may be sent while using any Scan Code Set
	    but only has effect when Scan Code Set 3 is in use.
	FE  Resend, should be sent when a transmission error is detected
	    from the keyboard
	FF  Reset, Keyboard sends ACK and waits for system to receive it
	    then begins a program reset and Basic Assurance Test (BAT).
	    Keyboard returns a one byte completion code then sets default
	    Scan Code Set 2.

Programming the Keyboard 


=============================================================================
 Overview 
==========

The operation of the keyboard is really quite simple. Every time a key
is pressed or released an interrupt 9 is generated, and reading the value
from port 60h tells you what happened.

=============================================================================
 Decoding the Keyboard Byte 
============================

So let's say you've installed an interrupt handler to handle all keyboard
events and when an interrupt is generated your handler reads the byte from
port 60h. What now?

Well..each key on the keyboard has an associated scan code which is contained
in the lower 7 bits of the byte. The most significant bit (ie bit 7) tells
you what was actually done, 0 = key was just pressed, 1 = key was just
released. If someone had just pressed the ESC key for instance, the port will
show a value of 1 (1 is the ESC key's scan code). If they hold their finger
on the button the keyboard will keep generating interrupt 9's and each
time the port will still show a value of 1. When the person releases the key
a final interrupt will be generated and the port will return 129 (1 + 128,
since the high bit will be set indicating the person has released the key).

Well...it's almost this simple. Some keys are "extended" keys. When an
extended key is pressed an interrupt is generated and the keyboard port
will return a value of 224 (E0h). This means that an extended key was pressed
and it's *extended* scan code will be available during the *next* interrupt.
Note that the left control key has a scan code of 29, while the *right*
control key has an *extended* scan code of 29. The same applies to the alt
keys and the arrow keys (keypad arrows vs the other ones).

It would be nice if all keys were created equal and we could just throw away
the 224 extended bytes and handle all the other bytes normally. Unfortunately
there are two buttons which on my machine at least (and others I have tested)
do some really weird stuff:

PrtScn
======

Pressing this button will send *2* extended characters to the handler, 42
and 55, so the actual byte sequence will be 224, 42, 224, 55. (Also note
that the left shift key has a regular scan code of 42, so there goes our
idea of just throwing 224's away). Only the extended 55's are sent during
auto-repeat. When the key is released, the two are sent again with the high
bits set (224, 170, 224, and 183). If any of the shift or control keys are
being held down when the PrtScn button is pressed then only the (224, 55) is
sent when the key is pressed and only the (224, 183) is sent when it's
released. If the alt key is being held down (System Request) then the key
behaves like an ordinary key with scan code 84. The practical upshot of all
this is that the handlers you write to handle normal keys and extended keys
will work fine with all the different PrtScn combinations (although a program
would have to check normal key 84 *AND* extended key 55 in order to determine
if the key is currently being pressed).

Pause/Break
===========

Welcome to hell. If you press this key while either of the the control keys
are being held down, it will behave like extended key 70, at all other times
it will send the following bytes: (225, 29, 69, 225, 157, 197). Holding the
key down does not result in autorepeat. Taking your finger off the key does
not send any extra bytes, they appear to be sent after the "key down" bytes
when you first press the key. Notice that 225 isn't 224, so our normal
extended character handler will not take care of this. My personal theory is
that while a scan code of 224 (E0h) means there is 1 more character
following, a scan code of 225 (E1h) means there are *2* more following. I've
seen a number of keyboard handler libraries and they all seem to overlook
this key. So why not be the first kid on your block to have a keyboard
handler which properly supports the Pause/Break key? CHECK IT OUT!!

=============================================================================
 Writing a Handler 
===================

Writing a keyboard handler is fairly straightforward. This section will
show how to do it in Pascal (you C and asm programmers would probably already
know this stuff anyway).

First we'll declare a few things we'll need:

const KEYBOARDINTR = 9;
      KEYBOARDPORT = $60;

var BIOSKeyboardHandler : procedure;
    CallBIOSHandler : boolean;

The CallBIOSHandler variable will be initialised by the calling program. If
we also want the BIOS handler to process all keystrokes then this variable
must be set to true.

Next we need to store the value of the current handler and set up own our
own one. We'll use a procedure called KeyboardHandler to handle the actual
interrupt.

CallBIOSHandler := false; { ...or set it to true if you want. }
GetIntVec(KEYBOARDINTR, @BIOSKeyboardHandler);
SetIntVec(KEYBOARDINTR, Addr(KeyboardHandler));

Ok, so everything is now set up and our handler will now be able to process
all keyboard events. The actual interrupt handler could look like this:

{$F+}
procedure KeyboardHandler(Flags, CS, IP, AX, BX, CX, DX,
                          SI, DI, DS, ES, BP: Word);
interrupt;
var key : byte;
begin

  key := Port[KEYBOARDPORT];

  { PROCESS THE KEYSTROKE HERE }

  if CallBIOSHandler then

  { Call the BIOS keyboard handler if the calling program wants us to }
    begin
      asm pushf end;
      BIOSKeyboardHandler;
    end

  { Otherwise just acknowledge the interrupt }
  else Port[$20] := $20;
end;
{$F-}


When the program is finished we can set the old keyboard handler again:

SetIntVec(KEYBOARDINTR, @BIOSKeyboardHandler);

=============================================================================
 A Word of Warning 
===================

When I was writing a simple handler to test the info in this file I did
something REALLY stoopid which I would like to share with the world. I
thought that my program was stuffing the keyboard up because when I exited
the program my editor (Borland Pascal 7.0) would act as though the control
button was being held down (I'm sure some of you have already started
laughing by now). I had to press it after each time I ran the program
just to sort it out. After spending a few hours looking all over the place
for info on what could possibly be wrong I realised what I was doing. I was
pressing CTRL-F9 to compile the program which would also immediately make it
run and I was releasing the control key when my program was running, ie the
regular BIOS handler was not getting the control key's "key up" command and
still thought it was being held down when my program returned control to
it. Moron.....

=============================================================================

The following is a list of all the regular key scan codes in numerical
order:
