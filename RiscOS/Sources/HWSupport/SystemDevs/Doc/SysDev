 SystemDevices 1.17 (05-Mar-91)
 ==============================

 * Bug fixed in kbd: which caused it to read off the end of its buffer if
   you typed in a line of 255 characters in response to a BGET.

 * EOF on kbd: now continues to return TRUE once it has got a character &04
   (Ctrl-D) - it used to only return EOF once, but FileSwitch's EOF flag was
   set, so BGET would return with carry set, but EOF would be returning
   FALSE.

 SystemDevices 1.16
 ====================

This module has undergone some minor changes for RISC OS 2.50.

 * 'Serial' has now been removed from the system devices module,
   this is provided by the DeviceFS and SerialDeviceDriver modules.

 * 'Printer:' now supports multiple streams - if the device that the
   stream is going to does.

 * Extensions for RISC OS Kernel 2.09.


 Printer:
 ========

Printer: has been extended to allow multiple streams to be opened onto
suitable devices, eg. NetPrint, this is done by the system first checking to
see if a PrinterType$x varaible is defined, where x relates to the printer
desintation.

If this variable does exist then the 'printer:' filing system will try to
open a file onto this object and then stream data to it.  If the variable
does not exist then the original system is used.


 RISC OS Kernel 2.09
 ===================

The module has also been changed to setup PrinterType$0 to equal Null:. 
This feature is used within the kernel now for talking to devices,
originally all printer destinations <=3 would be handled by the kernel and
anything above would be redirected to the specified file in the system
variable.

Now the kernel always redirects to the system variable.
