/*
 * Initialisation code
 * ===================
 *
 * Return NULL if your initialisation succeeds; otherwise return a pointer
 * to an error block. cmd_tail points to the string of arguments with which
 * the module is invoked (may be "", and is control-terminated, not zero
 * terminated).
 * podule_base is 0 unless the code has been invoked from a podule.
 * pw is the 'R12' value established by module initialisation. You may
 * assume nothing about its value (in fact it points to some RMA space
 * claimed and used by the module veneers). All you may do is pass it back
 * for your module veneers via an intermediary such as SWI OS_CallEvery
 * (use _swix() to issue the SWI call).

/*
 * Finalisation code
 * =================
 *
 * Return NULL if your finalisation succeeds. Otherwise return a pointer to
 * an error block if your finalisation handler does not wish to die (e.g.
 * toolbox modules return a 'Task(s) active' error).
 * fatal, podule and pw are the values of R10, R11 and R12 (respectively)
 * on entry to the finalisation code.
 */
_kernel_oserror *module_finalise(int fatal, int podule, void *pw);


/*
 * SWI handler code
 * ================
 *
 * swi_offset contains the offset of the SWI into your SWI chunk.
 * r points to the registers passed to the SWI.
 *
 * Return NULL if the SWI is handled successfully; otherwise return
 * a pointer to an error block which describes the error.
 * The veneer code sets the 'V' bit if the returned value is non-NULL.
 * The special value error_BAD_SWI may be returned if you do not
 * implement a SWI; the veneer will arrange for the appropriate
 * standard internationalised error 'SWI value out of range for
 * module TouchScreen' to be returned.
 * The handler may update any of its input registers (R0-R9).
 * pw is the private word pointer ('R12') value passed into the
 * SWI handler entry veneer.

/*
 * Vector handlers
 * ===============
 *
 * This is the name of the vector handler entry veneer
 * compiled by CMHG. Use this name as an argument to SWI
 * OS_Claim. (EventV claimants should use a CMHG event handler).
 *
 * Note that vector handlers were previously called IRQ handlers
 * and were documented as being for attaching to IrqV. IrqV has
 * long being deprecated; you should use OS_ClaimDeviceVector and
 * a CMHG generic veneer instead.

 *   Return 1 to pass on the call.
 * If you use a vector handler veneer for any other purpose, always
 * return non-0, and consider the use of a generic veneer instead.
 * It is not currently possible to return an error from a vector
 * handler.
 *
 * 'r' points to a vector of words containing the values of R0-R9 on
 * entry to the veneer. If r is updated, the updated values will be
 * loaded into R0-R9 on return from the handler.
 *
 * pw is the private word pointer ('R12') value with which the
