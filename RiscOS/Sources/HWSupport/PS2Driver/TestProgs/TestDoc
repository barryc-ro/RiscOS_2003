This directory contains the following test programs, designed to check that
PS/2 keyboards and the PS2Driver software module conform to the Keyboard
Extension Software Functional Specification (2107,730/FS). See also the
TestProgs directory in Sources.Internat.IntKey for further keyboard test
programs.

 PS2Test1
 --------
 
This program prints out all PS/2 codes received from the keyboard. Before
running it, you need to load the debugging version of the PS2Driver module
'PS2DrivDbg' in this directory. This is made from the normal PS2Driver
sources by setting the flag 'CaptureInput' to true (for the release version
of the module this should always be set to false).

When you run the program, it prints out (in hex) the codes received from the
keyboard. These should match those codes detailed in the spec.

Note that:

 a) the program exits if you press Escape or Break, so it's not possible with
this program to check the key-up sequence for these two keys;

 b) pressing Caps lock, Num lock or Scroll lock will cause the OS to send
down the command to set the LED state, which the keyboard will acknowledge,
so you see the extra bytes FA, FE after the normal key code;

 c) after running this program, you should reboot the machine, so that the
standard PS2Driver module is reinitialised.

 PS2Test2
 --------

This program intercepts KeyV and prints out calls to this vector indicating
keys going up or down - it prints the key up/down code in green for the key
going down, and in red for the key going up. By pressing and releasing single
keys or combinations of keys you can tell that the PS2Driver is correctly
converting the PS/2 scan codes into key up/down codes, once you have
established that the keyboard is sending the correct PS/2 codes using
PS2Test1.
