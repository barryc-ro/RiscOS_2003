Ursula changes for DualSerial
-----------------------------

On Phoebe, we have 2 serial ports as standard in the combo chip.
However, unlike the NC, these ports have individual interrupts, and
so this needs to be changed in the DualSerial source. Also, the second
serial port on Phoebe is capable of acting over an IR link OR a wire
link.

In order to add this, a pair of IOCtl reason codes will be added...

IOCtl reason code 11
	read IR capability of port
	  bit
	   0 - IrDA capable
	   1 - ConsumerIR capable
	   2 - ASK-IR

IOCtl reason code 12
	set/read IR status of port
	  0 - Wired
	  1 - IrDA
	  2 - ConsumerIR
	  3 - ASK-IR
	   
note that the 'capability' of being driven in a set mode does not imply
anything about the data format required.



An additional problem is that we need to retain as much backwards compatibility
as possible, namely OS_SerialOps etc.
