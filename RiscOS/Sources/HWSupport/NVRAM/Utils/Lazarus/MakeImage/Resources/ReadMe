ReadMe

This example intends to show how to construct the EEPROM image for Bethany
machines.

* main/c is the main c code source file.
* ExampInput is an example input configuration file.
* ExampOut is the output file that should be produced from the example input
configuration file.

The main/c program should be relatively easy to port to other
platforms. However, this has not been tried.

When first trying a port, use the ExampInput file as the inout and compare
the output against the ExampOut file. If they differ then a problem has
occured during the port.
