The Tags file contains all of the NV-RAM allocations for a particular
machine.

Please use the 'nvcheck' utility in the NVRAM.dev directory to check that
the Tags file is valid after making any changes.

The NVRAM module itself assumes that the Tags file is valid and contains no
clashes etc. The 'nvcheck' utility checks the syntax of the file including
broken tags, invalid location descriptors, invalid numbers, wrong number of
fields, ranges and allocations which clash.
