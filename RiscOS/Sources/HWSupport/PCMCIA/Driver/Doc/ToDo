PCMCIA 'Berlin' Hardware driver 'to-do' list
============================================

FIXED?  Update IRQ despatcher to support multiple IRQs properly
        
FIXED   Change function 6 (Select data mode) to no longer use R2
        
IMPLEM  Really ought to write functions 13 & 14! (Implemented but not tested)
        
FIXED   Match the naming of functions 18 & 19 to the FS
        
BODGED  Enable use in any podule slot that supports DEBI - NB If Stork uses podule 0, then don't bother <gasp!>.
        
FIXED   Need some sort of fix for Stork due to there only being -* 1 *- PCMCIA slot
        
FIXED?  Make sure function descriptions in the code match the spec!
