 Important
 ---------

1) In DeviceFS_Register/RegisterObj, list of devices must have zero word at
+24 for future expansion.

2) Change DeviceFS_CallDevice to pass in a parameter which says whether r1
is the path name or the parent record pointer.

3) Allow device to know buffer number.


 Not so important
 ----------------

1) Remove list of devices from DeviceFS_Register, and only have it in
DeviceFS_RegisterObj. That way you can add to the device structure at will.

2) Docn. of SleepRX could be improved.

3) Docn. of EnumDir: why does the path get passed in - it's not the device's
job to parse path names.
