 Dear Mr. Muddiman,

 re - Sony ATAPI CDU55E version 1.0u

The problem also occured with version 1.0g.

Sending this command (ReadCD) should read any form of data.
It should return 2340 bytes consisting of - all headers, user data, EDC & ECC.
It should read mode 1, mode 2 form 1 or mode 2 form 2 data. (not concerned about CD-DA).
The Panasonic drive carries out this command as expected.  The Sony drive replies that there are
in fact 0 bytes to be read, but the drive light stays on as if there is data to come.

The reason data is being read this way is because the sector type is not necessarily known, or
in the case of mode 2 data may alternate between form 1 and form 2.

I've done some tests - if the expected sector type is set to whatever the block really is, ie
mode 2 form 1 then everything works fine, but not with an expected
sector type of 0.

 0xbe                 ; Opcode for ReadCD
 0x00                 ; expected sector type = 0 (any)
 0x00                 ; }
 0x00                 ; } Logical block address = 16
 0x00                 ; }
 0x10                 ; }
 0x00                 ; ]
 0x00                 ; ] Transfer 1 block of data
 0x01                 ; ]
 0x78                 ; flag bits (header, sub-header, user data, EDC & ECC)
 0x00                 ; sub-channel data = 0 so none
 0x00                 ; reserved = 0
