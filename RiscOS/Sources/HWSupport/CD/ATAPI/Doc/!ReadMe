 Dear Martin,
             please find version 1.00 of ATAPI driver on this disc.



Drives tested with       Noticed
------------------       -------
Sony CDU55E BC           Works fine with audio, mode 1 and mode 2 form 1 (PhotoCD)
                         Doesn't work with mode 2 form 2 - CD-I green/white book discs

Panasonic CR-571         Works fine with audio, mode 1, mode 2 form 1, green/white book
                         Seems a bit pushed to play Replay in mode 28 on A5000.  Just copes.


  Basically, I'd go with the Panasonic drive - especially if it's cheaper.  I would advise
testing it out playing MPEG videos as these may be heavy on processor power.  It's probably
fine, but it's the one thing I can't test (as it is v. important to you guys).

ps  I've still got a 40MB harddisc of yours and an 8MB A5000.  Do you want them back ? (ho-ho)
