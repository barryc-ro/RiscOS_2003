/* File:    modulehdr.cmhg
 * Purpose: Header for DaytonaHW module
 * Author:  Ben Laughton
 * History:
 * 1997-07-11: BAL: 0.01
 * Created
 *
 * 1997-08-12: BAL: 0.02
 * Does everything except LEDs
 *
 * 1997-08-13: BAL: 0.03
 * Made reading the processor I/O register a bit safer.
 *
 * 1997-08-19: BAL: 0.04
 * Uses new callx library to do Callbacks, CallAfters and CallEverys instead of
 * CMHG generic veneers, so that handlers can be passed a private data pointer.
 *
 * 1997-08-26: BAL: 0.05
 * Reimplemented processor I/O register routines in assembler due to paranoia.
 *
 * 1997-08-27: BAL: 0.06
 * Changed modem reset to use correct bits (ie. not bits specified in Hardware
 * spec. 003).
 *
 * 1997-08-27: BAL: 0.07
 * Changer ringer to be active low to reflect change from Hardware spec.
 *
 * 1997-08-28: BAL: 0.08
 * Added option to reset modem using DTR instead of Processor I/O register.
 *
 * 1997-08-28: BAL: 0.09
 * Added SWI to enable / disable fax receiver detection.
 *
 * 1997-08-29: BAL: 0.10
 * Added support for controlling power LED in same way as other LEDs for self
 * test.
 *
 * 1997-08-30: BAL: 0.11
 * Fixed bug in fake exhange: was always sending 'cant add callafter error'
 * after script finishes.
 *
 * 1997-08-31: BAL: 0.12
 * Really changed ringer to be active low (see 0.07 :-). Fixed a bit of
 * inverted logic to do with On/Off states. Changed timings to seconds instead
 * of centiseconds!
 *
 * 1997-08-31: BAL: 0.13
 * Yet another logic bug in call local fax (couldn't detect whether it was
 * currently calling or not).
 *
 * 1997-09-05: BAL: 0.14
 * Modified fake exchange hangup script to issue #VLS=0 (don't think it will
 * make any difference though).
 *
 * 1997-09-11: BAL, SBF: 0.15
 * Incorporated SBF's changes to number capture to make it more reliable.
 *
 * 1997-09-11: BAL: 0.16
 * Changed the way that fake exchange interacts with the dialler.  Put more
 * hangups in.
 *
 * 1997-09-11: BAL: 0.17
 * Version 0.16 managed to remove the termination from the captured number.
 *
 * 1997-09-12: BAL: 0.18
 * Fixed hangup script - had missed of AT from AT#VLS=0
 *
 * 1997-09-15: BAL: 0.19
 * Changed dialtone amplitude back to original value to test hardware fix.
 *
 * 1997-09-29: BAL: 0.20
 * Changed fakeexchange to use DiallerB
 *
 * 1997-10-08: MGR: 0.21
 * Changed DLEE to DLEp.  Always ensure enough space in buffer for DLEp.
 * Silence now used to end number instead of inserting pauses.
 *
 * 1997-10-10: MGR: 0.22
 * Reinstated buffer flushing after capturing first digit in fakeexchange.
 *
 * 1997-11-11: BAL, MGR: 0.23
 * Fakeexchange hangup script now sends <DLE><CAN> instead of fakeexchange
 * itself (we beleive Dialler was flushing the buffers before the <DLE><CAN>
 * actually got sent, which was making the test software fail.  No idea why we
 * never observed this in 'normal' operation).
 *
 * Made aware that DiallerB SWI chunk and service call number has now changed.
 *
 * Added new SWI to allow sending of Wimp messages to be enabled / disabled.
 *
 * Added EEPROM control.
 *
 * 1997-11-27: BAL: 0.24
 * Added missing newline in fakeexchange hangup script
 *
 * 1998-01-21: BAL: 0.25
 * Fixed stupid cut-and-paste bug in DTR modem reset (wasn't reasserting DTR)
 *
 * 1998-03-26: BAL
 * DaytonaHW has been placed under srccommit control, so see the VersionNum file
 * for the log.
