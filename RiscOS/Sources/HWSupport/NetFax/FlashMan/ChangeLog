Version:	0.10
Date:		1998-07-29
Name:		John Beranek
CVS tag:	jberanek_flashman-0_10

#ifdef'd out TinyStubs calls, in an attempt to fix DayFlashMan to run with
an XIP SharedCLibrary in AppFlash.

Tidied up the Makefile, and made changes so that XIP DayFlashMan should work.

Made it so that the debug version doesn't go into an infinite loop on flash
error.

Version:	0.09
Date:		1998-05-05
Name:		John Beranek
CVS tag:	jberanek_flashman-0_09

Changed FlashMan's behaviour when there's a Serial flash error on
intitialisation.  It now prints a pretty box, and puts the box in a live-lock,
so that the box isn't booted with a faulty serial flash.
