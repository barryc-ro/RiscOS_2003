These notes have been put together to provide a skeleton C/OBJASM module
structure that will fit into the Acorn ROM build mechanism.

The example C module given does the following :
* Uses features of the latest cmhg to generate C header files
* Provided the simple calls to use TinyStubs

Variations on this core structre might consist of :
* Sources - conditional assembly of debug/non-debug versions of the module
* rm - multiple targets based on machine/system/userif oriented builds
* Docs - location of useful nugets of info
* Resources - different locales, userif etc
* Test - location of any test harnesses used - sources and makefiles in same
  style as build process.
