Added three additional flags - FaxConfigured, EmailConfigured and
FactoryDefault for use by !DaytSetup.  The first two are used to specify
when Daytona is sufficiently configured to allow fax and email transfers
respectively.  The FactoryDefault flag is to be utilised by !DaytSetup
internally to ascertain when the serial flash has been erased: it will
be reset (zero) when the flash is blank, and !DaytSetup will set it (one)
once the configuration has been altered by the user.  This allows !DaytSetup
to provide some suitable default values in cases where the serial flash is
in its erased state.
