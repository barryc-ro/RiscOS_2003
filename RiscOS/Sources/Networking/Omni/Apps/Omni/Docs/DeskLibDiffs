Rough overview of differences between ANT's customised version of DeskLib and
'recent' Desk/DeskLib sources

Icon

GetText

ANT bahvioural change.  Normal DeskLib will copy contents of buffer up to 0
terminator or size of indirection buffer in no term, then force 0 termination
of the destination string on the first control character, or at the end of
the buffer.  ANT's will copy the contents of the buffer up to the first
control character, or up to wimp_MAXNAME if the icon isn't indirected, then
force this char to 0.  In the non indirected case this will potentially write
one char past the destination.  Also, allows sloppy programming as it means
can often get away with dest buffers smaller then indirection buffers!

printf
SetDouble
SetInteger
SetText

General change - common code moved out of first 3 and put into last one,
which others now call.

Window

ANT have Window_CreateSpriteArea instead of Window_Create.

ANT's Window_Show attempts to ensure Window will be completely on screen,
whereas DeskLib's just ensures some furniture on screen.  Though in ANT's, if
window is wider than mode, it'll 'right justify' the window whereas I'd have
thought it'd be more sensible to left jusity it.
