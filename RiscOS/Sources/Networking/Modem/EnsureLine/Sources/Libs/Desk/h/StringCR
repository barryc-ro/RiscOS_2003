    File:    stringcr.h
    Author:  Copyright © 1992, 1993 Jason Williams
    Version: 1.13 (30 May 1993)
    Purpose: Provides functions identical in operation to those defined in
             ANSI <string.h>, except that these functions all work with strings
             that have non-zero terminating characters (BASIC and the WIMP
             often use a char 13 instead of a char 0 to terminate their
             strings). ANY char < 32 will terminate these strings.
             These functions are currently defined in Sublibrary Misc.c.*
