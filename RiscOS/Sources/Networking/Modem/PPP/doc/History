Fixed bug in command handler: command string tail was being written to, which is
not allowed.  This causes 'abort on data transfers' if you use OS_CLI (or C's
'system') to call a *command from a program in ROM which has the command string
embedded in its code (eg. as a string literal in C).  This is because the
command handler would try to write to ROM!

Changed some of the dialler flags checks to check for autodialling as well as
just use of the dialler.

Got rid of a couple of warnings.  I hate them, I hate them...

Added the doc directory and started this history file.
