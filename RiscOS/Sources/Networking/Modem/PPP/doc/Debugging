DebugLib may be used to debug PPP. 

However, I found it would not work writing to PDebug (parallel port debug)
or to a file unless buffering was enabled.

To do this, use these calls to initialise DebugLig:

    debug_initialise ("PPP", "izipfs:$.Spool.PPP", "");
    debug_atexit ();
    debug_output_buffer_on(0, 512000);

You also need to write the buffer to a file at some stage. I did this in 
ppp_quit() which is called at module finalisation. 

Run the test and then RMKill PPP to write the debug output.
