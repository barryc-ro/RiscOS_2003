Two different variants of PPP can be built: one to work with
blockdrivers and one to work with the new-style DeviceFS interface.  For
ROM builds (under the new !Builder system) the build can be selected by
passing down options to PPP from the components file.

For the blockdriver version the entry in the components file should be:
PPP		-options ASMBLOCKDRIVERS=TRUE CBLOCKDRIVERS=-DBLOCKDRIVERS

For the DeviceFS version the entry in the components file should be:
PPP		-options ASMBLOCKDRIVERS=FALSE
