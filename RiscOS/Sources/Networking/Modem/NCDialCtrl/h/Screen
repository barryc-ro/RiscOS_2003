 /* Screen_CacheModeInfo --------------------------------------------------
  * This should be called before you try to use any of the above screen 
  * variables. It only needs to be called whenever the screen mode changes
  * so call it:
  *   a) When you initialise your program, and whenever a mode change
  *      message is received (see ModeChangeHandler, below)
  *   b) Immediately before you use the variables (i.e. in your redraw
  *      handler, etc.)
  *
  * It checks the screenmode, and if it has not changed, then the variables
  * are not updated, so it is not too bad if you call it more often than
  * you really need to (i.e. every time you redraw, for example).
