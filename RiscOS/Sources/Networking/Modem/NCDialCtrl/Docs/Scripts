Scripts used by NCDialCtrl (Justin Fletcher, 16 Jun 2000)
--------------------------
NCDialCtrl takes scripts from NCMA using the tag 'SEND_EXPEXT'. These scripts
are of the form :
  <expect><lf><send><lf>

<expect> and <send> should be short, 79 characters is the current maximum
(filegen create_diallerB_script). <send> and <expect> will be converted to
a form that DiallerB can understand.

<send> may contain special strings to indicate replacements should be used.
(expand_special in c.module deals with this)
  ATDT will be replaced by the dial command for the remote system.
  send_user will be replaced with the user string
  send_pass will be replaced with the password string


Country configuration / Dialing
-------------------------------
NVRAM tag ModemCountry is used to set up the country dial strings. These are
read from the MessageTrans file InetDBase:Files.ModemCtrl using the tag
Country# (where # is the ModemCountry number). ModemCountry should be
regarded as a RISC OS territory number. The read string will be inserted
in the to the ATDT command to dial the provider. The full string is :
AT<country><dial ignore><dial type><prefix><dialtone wait><call waiting disable><phone number>

Other tags used :
  ModemDialIngore
  ModemDialType - selects pulse, tone, or fast pulse
  ModemPrefixStatus - are we using a prefix or not
  ModemPrefix - the prefix we're using
  ModemDialTone - whether we wait for dialtone after prefix
  ModemCallWaitingStatus - whether we are disabling call waiting
  ModemCallWaiting - string to disable call waiting
