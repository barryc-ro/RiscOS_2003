/* File:    header.cmhg
 * Purpose: Header and history log for Dialler module
 * Author:  Ben Laughton
 * History:
 *
 * 1997-07-22: BAL
 * Started history log.
 * Fixed bug where couldn't execute more than one script if using client
 * supplied handles.
 *
 * 1997-07-24: BAL
 * Made Dual Serial buffer flushing use new IOCtls.
 *
 * 1997-08-12: BAL: 0.08
 * Fixed cancelling of connection timeout
 *
 * 1997-08-27: BAL: 0.09
 * Answer script wasn't calling serial_setup_vars
 *
 * 1997-08-28: BAL: 0.10
 * Fixed bug: serial_close was altering the connection status bits (clearing
 * ConnectionChanging) - why?  Anyway, this was obviously screwing up the
 * connected outgoing / incoming flags.
 *
 * 1997-09-01: BAL: 0.11
 * Fixed faults in calling sequence for serial_close and serial_open.  Only
 * does serial_close when finishing a hangup script or aborting a script to
 * start another one.
 *
 * 1997-09-01: BAL: 0.12
 * Changed behiaviour of report / status strings.  They are no longer cleared
 * at the start and end of a script, so you can read them after the script
 * terminates.
 *
 * 1997-09-01: BAL: 0.13
 * Can receive report strings across expect strings Fixed timeout bug: TIMEOUT 0
 * was not disabling timeout.
 *
 * 1997-09-02: BAL: 0.14
 * Version 0.13 broke expect strings (eg. would remember previous OK); now
 * fixed.  Fixed escaping of \ (ie. \\) in put_string.
 *
 * 1997-09-02: BAL: 0.15
 * Added flag to not reset modem before starting script
 *
 * 1997-09-03: BAL: 0.16 & 0.17
 * Fixed bug in expect strings.  If two consecutive expect strings arrived in
 * the same chunk of data then the second string would not be matched.
 *
 * 1997-09-03: BAL: 0.18
 * If two consecutive expect strings arrived in the same chunk of data then
 * the second string would not be matched until another chunk of data was read.
 *
 * 1997-10-03: BAL: 0.19
 * Fixed memory leak and trampling and added detection of serial stream
 * handles being closed underneath the Dialler's feet.
 * Removed assembler bits - they were not time critical and were easily done in
 * C.
 *
 * Changed log for Daytona build to go to centisecond resolution
 *
 * 1997-11-18: BAL: 0.20
 * Daytona build uses hardware modem reset instead of dropping DTR
 *
 * 1998-01-05: BAL: 0.21
 * Revamped error system.  Fixed abort string handling (would report wrong
 * string if other strings added in script).  Changed blockdriver loading code
 * to get rid of warning about cast of non-function pointer to function pointer.
 *
 * 1998-01-19: BAL: 0.22
 * Fixed line drop detection routine to work properly if no script is being
 * executed.
 *
 * 1998-01-20: BAL: 0.23
 * Removed 'standard' abort strings.  The Dialler will no longer abort on these
 * strings - they must be activated by putting "ABORT <string>" in the script.
 * However, if any of these strings _are_ activated they still return the
 * previously defined error codes.
 *
 * 1998-02-02: BAL: 0.24
 * Fixed memory leak in log.c
 *
 * 1998-02-13: BAL
 * Dialler and DiallerB can be built from the same sources (its messy but I
 * couldn't think of any other way).
 *
 * 1998-02-17: BAL: 0.25
 * Added new status value for user-defined (ie. non-standard) ABORT strings
