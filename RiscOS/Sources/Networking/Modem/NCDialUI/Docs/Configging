                      ========================

NCDiallerUI expects to find a file Resources:$.Resources.DiallerUI.Config
containing a list of Service_DiallerStatus reason codes, flags, and the
URL or filename to be used with that reason code. The file used for the
RCA NC100 project (and this the default if it is not overwritten) is...

0x00 308 None
0x04 208 None
0x81 004 file:/Resources:$/Resources/DiallerUI/HTML/NoDial
0x82 007 Resources:$.Resources.DiallerUI.HTML.Busy
0x83 007 Resources:$.Resources.DiallerUI.HTML.Server
0x84 007 Resources:$.Resources.DiallerUI.HTML.Server
0x85 006 Resources:$.Resources.DiallerUI.HTML.Error
0x86 006 Resources:$.Resources.DiallerUI.HTML.Error
0x91 104 file:/Resources:$/Resources/DiallerUI/HTML/Dialling
0x92 006 Resources:$.Resources.DiallerUI.HTML.Connect
0x93 004 file:/Resources:$/Resources/DiallerUI/HTML/Verify

Each line in the file starts in the left hand column with '0x' followed
by a reason code in hex. The flags are also hex digits, currently only
the lower 12 bits are used.

Bit 0 of the flags word indicates that the URL or filename can be masked
out if NCDialUI_Start has been called with the '1' parameter, for RCA this
is used to hide the the 'Busy' and 'server unavailable' screens.

Bit 1 if set means the screen has dynamic fields which need to be filled
in before they are displayed. In this case, the third parameter in the
line must be a filename, not a URL.

Bit 2 indicates the screen is to be displayed as an OSD by the browser,
rather than full screen.

Bit 3 if set means there is no HTML file associated with this code.

Bits 4-7 are currently unallocated.

Bits 8-11 are the least significant digit of a sound event. This is added
to 0x20000 before being passed to SWI SoundFX_Play.

For dynamic screens the HTML should contain a pseudo HTML tag <XTAG> which
can take two parameters, 'scf' indicates a field should be read from the
smart card (via the managed access module) and the text inserted. *Note
that there is no checking to ensure it is actually a text file. It is
assumed the Config file is correct!* The second parameter is 'alt' to give
the text to be used if the smart card field is not found, eg in the RCA
NC100 the Connect screen contains a line...

       Connecting to <XTAG scf="ISP_NAME" alt="the ISP">

...so the DiallerUI tries to look up the ISP name from the smart card,
and if it fails puts in the alt text to give 'Connecting to the ISP'
instead. Note that alt text must be contained in quotes, and it advisable
to do the same for the scf field.
