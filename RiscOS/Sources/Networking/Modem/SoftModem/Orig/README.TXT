Patches

When important changes need to be made to a module before the next
version release, we create a patch. These patch files are available on our
Customer Support BBS, at (919) 846-1966, as long as the code is in
warranty or a Service Agreement is in effect.  

To access the patches, first register on the BBS.  When you have been
given full access, select the "Software Support" item from the main
menu, then select the "How to Use" item.  Further directions will be
displayed.


==============================================================
Notes:

1) The file art.exe is a self-extracting file containing all
   source and makefiles. To setup the working directory, copy
   the file into desired location and execute the command:
       art -d

   This will then create a list of sub-directories and place all 
   the code in the correct location.

2) The makefiles require OPUS V6.04 or later.

3) To build the code, execute the command:
       make art
