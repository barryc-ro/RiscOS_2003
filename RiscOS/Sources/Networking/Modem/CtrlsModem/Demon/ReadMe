This directory contains the Demon debug monitor sources and objects. 
For details, please refer to the following documentation:

 -  The ARM Debug Monitor section of the technical specifications
 -  The Remote Debug Protocol technical specification
 -  Files 'demon' and 'fpe' in the notes directory

This directory contains the following:

	level1.s	Level 1 of Demon
	checkmem.s	RAM checker and sizing routine
	crc.c		A program to add a 16 bit CRC to a file
	makemmu.c	A program to add MMU tables to a file
	split.c		A program to split an file into four pieces
	fpe_26l.o	The Floating Point Emulator code, 26-bit variant
	fpe_32l.o	The Floating Point Emulator code, 32-bit variant
	init_rom.s	Installer for the FPE
	pie		Directory containing pie-specific code
	
Level 0 of Demon is concerned with booting and testing the card, and
supplying a simple environment for Level 1. Level 1 contains code to
support the Remote Debug Protocol (RDP), and implements a number of
SWI's to support both standalone programs and the ANSI C library.
	
The makefile creates executable versions of crc, makemmu, and split.
These are then used to make final ROM images, by adding a ROM CRC, adding 
MMU pagetables, and (in the case of the PID) splitting the image into four 
pieces ready for ROM programming.

The pie & pid directories both contain a driver.s, which is the board specific
serial driver code.

The pie directory contains a pre-built demon ROM image called 'image'.
This is identical to the image which would be built by using the makefile.
This can be used to program a replacement EPROM for a pie board
(current boards do not contain the latest floating-point emulator).

'make pie' constructs a file pie/pie which is the ROM image for a PIE card.
