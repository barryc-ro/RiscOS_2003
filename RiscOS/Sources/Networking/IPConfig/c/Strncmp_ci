/* Function to compare two strings case insensitively up to a maximum char count
 *
 * Originally: sbrodie
 *
 * Parameters: matches those of strncmp.
 * Result: matches the exit conditions of strncmp.
 *
 *
 * The conversions to unsigned int stop the compiler messing around with
 * shifts all over the place whilst trying to promote the chars to int
 * whilst retaining the sign.
 *
 * Problems: Choice of return value when strings do not match is based
 *           upon character number rather than any alphabetic sorting.
