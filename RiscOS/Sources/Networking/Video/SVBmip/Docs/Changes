Changes
=======

980410 - RCE - 0.02
-------------------

Added a channel usage flagging mechanism, to try to trap cases where an IGMP
leave hasn't been sent to a group before another join is attempted.

980421 - RCE - 0.02 -> 0.03
---------------------------

Added SWI_ReadChannelNames: a callable interface to the routine of the same

when it starts up (implemented by TMD 11/3/98 Sweden).

---------------------------

Modified usage flag to be join/leave counts.

980427 - RCE - 0.04 -> 0.05
---------------------------

Modified internal flagging to permit persistance of channel data over stream
start/end events - makes above counts useful !
