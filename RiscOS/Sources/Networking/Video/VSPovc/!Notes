EOS timeout operation CP 26/8/98
--------------------------------
Found in CheckEndofStream() (vspc.c) and tick_handler() (module.c)

Checks are made only when the controlling program polls for EOS.

If MPEGControl_Stats call fails (returns -1) then immediately timeout stream.

If data is being received (received data count is growing) then set end of
stream timer to 0.  Ie. disable it.

Otherwise, set the timer to its timeout value (2 - set in SysEnv.!SysLoad.!Run).
It will be decremented each tick (currently called every 100 cs).   When it
reaches 0, timeout occurs. (Note: setting counter to 0 or less disables timeout
since the initial value is checked before decrementing it).

If video is received, then EOS timer will be disabled again.
