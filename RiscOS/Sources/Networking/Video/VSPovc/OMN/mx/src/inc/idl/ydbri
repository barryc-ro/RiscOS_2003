// Interface to IIOP bridge
// Provides the function GetStats() that returns a ydbr_Stats structure
// containing all the important statistics about the IIOP bridge.
// The information includes the total number of different messages
// passed through, last message, any errors, last accessed time etc., on a
// per connection basis. It also gives the total # of connections so far
// managed (by this instance) and the number of connections currently
// being managed.
