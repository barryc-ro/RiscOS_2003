 * ycosyn0.h - Dumb header file for inclusion in the generated ycosyn.c file.
 *
 * NOTES
 * Slax needs to stash the size of PXVALTYPE (the union defined in ycosyn.y)
 * in the parser's virtual machine, but it is written in such a way that it
 * does not include the right header files to interpret the field types of
 * PXVALTYPE (which are potentially user-defined types), so it doesn't want
 * to include the real definition from ycosyn.h.
 *
 * Instead, it slimes in a typedef of PXVALTYPE of ub4, thereby always
 * assuming that PXVALTYPE is 4 bytes. Now, drop this code on a platform
 * with 64-bit pointers, and watch the compiler crash...
 *
 * Instead, the compiler's makefile uses sed to replace the slimey typedef
 * with an include of this file. So, this file should contain enough
 * #includes to make ycosyn.h (and therefore the real PXVALTYPE) stand on 
 * its own. 
 *
 * Have a nice day.
