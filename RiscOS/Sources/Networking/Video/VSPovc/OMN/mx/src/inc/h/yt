/*
 * ytOpen - open a port
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 * ytOpen() creates a port using the specified transport protocol.  A port
 * is an endpoint used for communication.  A port may be used to both send
 * and receive data.  A stream port is opened in an active, unconnected
 * mode, meaning that it either needs to be connected using ytConnect() or
 * converted to a passive port ysing ytListen().

/*
 * ytClose - close a port
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 * ytClose() closes a port.  ytClose() will block until all outgoing data
 * has been flushed.  To avoid blocking unexpectedly, use ytFlush() prior
 * to closing the port.  Any unread data or inbound connection requests
 * on passive streams are discarded.  For a connected port, the connection
 * is dissolved.
 */
void ytClose(ytp *port);

/*
 * ytFlush - flush a port
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 * ytFlush() flushes outgoing data from a port.  Data sent by a reliable
 * protocol is not flushed until receipt by the destination has been
 * confirmed.  A connection attempt is not flushed until the connection
 * completes.  The given event will be triggered when the data pending
 * at the time this routine is invoked has been flushed.  Subsequent
 * data sent may or not have been flushed.  If no event is given, ytFlush()
 * blocks unless the port is non-blocking.

/*
 * ytSetOptions, ytGetOptions - get & set options
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 * ytSetOptions() is used to modify the characteristics of the port.
 * ytGetOptions() returns the options that are currently set on the
 * port.
 *
 * The following options are defined:
 *   YTFLG_NONBLOCK - If set, the port is non-blocking.  Any operation
 *      initiated on such a port that would otherwise block will cause
 *      the YT_EX_WOULDBLOCK to be raised.
 *   YTFLG_MANFLUSH - If set, the port will not flush outbound data
 *      automatically.  A ytFlush() must always be executed in order
 *      to flush outbound data.

/*
 * ytBind - bind a name to a port
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 * ytBind() binds a name to a port.  When the port is created, it is
 * assigned a name dynamically.  ytBind() allows the port to be rebound
 * to a well-known port number.  Dynamic port numbers are assigned starting
 * at 1024, and port numbers below 128 are reserved.  Therefore, well-known
 * port numbers should be between these two values.
 */

/*
 * ytGetAddr, ytGetPeer - get the address of the port or the peer
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 * ytGetAddr() returns an address descriptor denoting the full address
 * of the given port.  ytGetPeer() returns an address descriptor denoting
 * the the address of the port to which this port is connected.  Thus,
 * ytGetPeer() is only valid on connected, stream-based ports.  The
 * address descriptor must be freed by the caller.

/*
 * ytListen - listen for connections
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 * ytListen() converts a stream port from active to passive mode.
 * Once in a passive mode, connections may be accepted from this
 * port.
 */
void ytListen(ytp *port);

/*
 * ytAccept - accept a connection
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 * ytAccept() accepts a connection from a passive stream port.  A
 * new port is created and returned.  The new port is used to read
 * and write data from and to the port which initiated the connection,
 * but cannot be used to accept further connections.  The original
 * port remains open and available to accept further connections.
 * If no connection requests are pending, ytAccept() will normally
 * block until the port is in a non-blocking mode.  ytTest() may be
 * used to test for inbound connnections.
 */
ytp *ytAccept(ytp *port);

/*
 * ytConnect - initiate a connection
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 * ytConnect() initiates a connection from an active stream port
 * to a passive stream port.  A port may only be connected once.
 * This routine will not cause any network traffic by itself.  The
 * destination port will not receive the connection attempt until
 * data is written to the port or the port is flushed.  A connection
 * may fail due to an inability to reach the destination or a bad
 * address.  Either YT_EX_FAILCONN or YT_EX_BADADDR may be raised
 * during any subsequent ytRead(), ytWrite(), or ytFlush() operation.
 */
void ytConnect(ytp *port, yta *addr);

/*
 * ytRead, ytReadV - read from a stream
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 * ytRead() reads up to max bytes of data into the buffer pointed to
 * by buf.  ytReadV() similarly reads data from a stream and scatters
 * it to the supplied buffer vector.  The buffer or buffer vector
 * passed in must remain valid until the operation completes.  The
 * read operation completes as soon as some amount of data is read,
 * unless the port is in a non-blocking mode or fill is TRUE.
 *
 * If fill is TRUE, the operation will not complete until the buffer
 * is filled or the end of the stream is reached.  If fill is TRUE,
 * and the port is non-blocking, and the full amount of data required
 * to fill the buffer is not available, and the call is synchronous
 * (i.e. no event descriptor is supplied), no data will be read and
 * the YT_EX_WOULDBLOCK exception is raised.
 *
 * The result of the operation is the number of bytes read and
 * transferred.  The operation may raise the exceptions:
 *   YT_EX_NOTCONN if the stream port is not connected;
 *   YT_EX_BROKEN if the communication with the peer is lost;
 *   YT_EX_DISCONN if the stream port was disconnected.

/*
 * ytWrite, ytWriteV - write to a stream
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 * ytWrite() writes len bytes of data pointed to by buf through the
 * connected port.  If insufficient buffer space is available to queue
 * the write, the routine will normally block until space becomes
 * available, unless the port has been placed into a non-blocking mode,
 * in which case some amount of data less than the total will be written.
 * ytWrite() returns as soon as the data is buffered.  ytFlush() may be
 * used to synchronize with the receiver on certain data.  ytWrite()
 * returns the number of bytes buffered.  Any of the exceptions raised
 * by ytRead() may be raised by ytWrite().

/*
 * ytSend, ytSendV - send a message or datagram
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 * ytSend() sends a message or datagram to the destination specified by
 * to.  If no buffer space is available to queue the send, these routines
 * normally block until space becomes available, unless the port has been
 * placed in a non-blocking mode.  If the protocol is reliable, the
 * operation completes when the other side confirms receipt of the data.
 * If the protocol is unreliable, the operation completes as soon as the
 * data is buffered.  The number of bytes in the message is returned.
 * The send operation may complete with one of the following exceptions:
 * YT_EX_BROKEN or YT_EX_BADADDR.  Messages sent from the same port to the
 * same destination are guaranteed to be received in the order they were
 * sent when using a reliable protocol.

/*
 * ytRecv, ytRecvV - receive a message or datagram
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 * ytRecv() receives a message.  The contents of the message are
 * transferred up to the limits of the given buffer.  The remainder
 * of the message is discarded.  ytRecvV() does the same thing but
 * scatters the contents of the message to the buffer vector.
 *
 * The receive operation completes when the entire message is received.
 * If the operation is synchronous, and the entire message has not yet
 * been received, and the port is non-blocking, ytRecv() will raise
 * the YT_EX_WOULDBLOCK exception.

/*
 * ytTest - test the port for inbound data
 *
 * ytTest() tests the given port for inbound data.  If the port
 * is a passive, stream port, ytTest() returns the number of
 * pending connection requests.  If the port is a connected stream
 * port, it returns the number of bytes available to read.  If the
 * port is a message or datagram port, it returns the number of bytes
 * contained in the next message or datagram.  It will continue to
 * return this value until reading of the message is begun.  Once it
 * is begun, ytTest() will return the amount of data remaining in the
 * current message.
 *
 * If there is no data pending, and the operation is synchronous,
 * then ytTest() will block until data arrives or the timeout expires,
 * unless the port is in a non-blocking mode.  If timeout is non-null,
 * then ytTest() will only block for the number of milliseconds
 * pointed to by the timeout value.  (Thus, if it is zero, ytTest()
 * will poll.)  If evt is provided with a timeout, the evt will be
 * triggered with a TIMEOUT exception if the time expires before the
 * event completes.
