9001, "unexpected internal error: %s from file %s, line %d; aborting..."
// *Cause: An internal error occurred.
// *Action: Report to Oracle.
9002, "unrecognized mode %s specified"
// *Cause: An unrecognized program mode was specified.  Valid modes are
//         "compile" (-c), "verify" (-v), "lookup" (-l), or "translate" (-t).
// *Action: Correct the command-line arguments and retry.
9003, "must specify either product or pathname(s)"
// *Cause: Files to be processed may be identified either by product,
//         by product plus facility, or by specifying one or more pathnames
//         explicitly.
// *Action: Correct the command-line arguments and retry.
9004, "%s: could not open file - %s"
// *Cause: The file could not be opened.  An operating-system specific
//         explanation is included.
// *Action: Check to make sure that the product and facility were specified
//          correctly.  Case-sensitivity may matter on some platforms.  Next,
//          check to make sure that the file exists.
9005, "%s: unexpected text in file at line %d"
// *Cause: In the source message file, lines prefixed by '#' or '/' are
//         treated as comments.  Lines prefixed by digits are message
//         declarations.  All other lines in the file must be empty.
// *Action: Edit the message file to correct the error.
9006, "%s: errors detected; no output generated"
// *Cause: Errors detected during parse phase prevent the output file from
//         being generated.
// *Action: Correct the errors and retry.
9007, "%s: could not create output file: %s"
// *Cause: The output file could not be created.  An operating-system
//         specific explanation is included.
// *Action: Correct the indicated condition and retry.
9008, "%s: error writing file"
// *Cause: The compiler was unable to write out all the required data.
// *Action: Most likely, disk space was exhausted or a disk error was
//          detected.  In either case, this must be corrected before retrying.
9009, "unrecognized output mode %s specified"
// *Cause: An unrecognized output mode was specified.  Valid mode are
//         "none" (-n), "force" (-F), or "normal" (default).
// *Action: Correct the command-line arguments and retry.
9010, "%s: duplicate message number %d at line %d"
// *Cause: The same message number appears more than once in the source file.
// *Action: Message numbers must be unique within a facility.  Correct the
//          conflict and retry.
9011, "%s: message number %d at line %d is out of range"
// *Cause: Message numbers must be positive numbers less than 65535.
// *Action: Change the message number to be valid and retry.
9012, "%s: parse error on line %d"
// *Cause: The syntax for a message declaration is not valid.
// *Action: Correct the line and retry.
9013, "unrecognized input style %s specified"
// *Cause: An unrecognized input style was specified.  Valid input styles
//         are "omn", "lms", or "mzl".
// *Action: Correct the command-line arguments and retry.
9014, "message id list required for lookup"
// *Cause: The -l option was specified without supplying one or more
//         message ids via the -m switch.
// *Action Correct the command-line arguments and retry.
9015, "message id %s is invalid"
// *Cause: An invalid message id was specified with the -m switch.
// *Action Correct the command-line arguments and retry.
9016, "message id %d was not found"
// *Cause: The given message id was not present in any of the searched
//         files.
// *Action: Correct the command-line argument.
9017, "unrecognized output style %s specified"
// *Cause: An unrecognized output style was specified.  Valid output styles
//         are "omn" or "lms".
// *Action: Correct the command-line arguments and retry.
9018, "%s: file appears to be truncated"
// *Cause: The message object file is corrupted.
// *Action: Regenerate from the original source.
9019, "%s: file has bad magic number"
// *Cause: The message object file is corrupted.
// *Action: Regenerate from the original source.
9020, "%s: directory not found"
// *Cause: Bad search path provided
// *Action: Check the value of the resource ys.log.msg-path and values for
//          the -I switch provided.

9051, "%s: lines=%d, messages=%d, low msgid=%d, high msgid=%d"
// *Cause: The parse of the source file is complete.
// *Action: No action is required.
9052, "%s: no output generated per -n switch"
// *Cause: The -n switch was specified; thus, no output is produced.
// *Action: No action is required.
9053, "%s: object file created"
// *Cause: The compiler has finished and produced the compiled message file.
// *Action: No action is required.
9054, "%s: object file created with errors"
// *Cause: The compiler has finished and produced the compiled message file,
//         even though there were errors in the source.
// *Action: Verify that the errors do not affect the results before using
//          the output.
9055, "searching for %s"
// *Cause: The compiler is indicating progress in its search for files.
// *Action: No action is required.
9056, "not found in %s"
// *Cause: The compiler is indicating progress in its search for files.
// *Action: No action is required.
9057, "opened %s"
// *Cause: The compiler is indicating that it has found and opened a message
//         file.
// *Action: No action is required.
9058, "%s: translated file created"
// *Cause: The compiler has finished and produced the translate source file.
// *Action: No action is required.
