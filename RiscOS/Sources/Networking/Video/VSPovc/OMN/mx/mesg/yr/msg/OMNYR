5500, "unexpected internal error: %s from file %s, line %d; aborting..."
// *Cause:
// *Action:
5501, "unable to locate interface repository server with tag '%s'"
// *Cause: No interface repository with the given implementation id is 
//         registered with the ORB daemon.
// *Action: Start up a new server with the expected tag, or change the
//          tag you are using to a registered server. Use mnorbls to
//          determine what tags are in use.
5502, "unable to get current working directory: %s"
// *Cause: Unable to determine the current working directory, needed to
//         translate all load file names into absolute pathnames. 
// *Action: Check directory privileges and try again.
5503, "file/directory not found: '%s'"
// *Cause: Unable to locate a file or directory to load into the server.
// *Action: Check pathnames and permissions and try again.
5504, "IFR data file '%s' appears corrupted"
// *Cause: A file was found which appears to be an IFR data file (has .ifr
//         suffix and expected header), but the data in the file is unreadable.
//         The file is either corrupted, or is of an IFR data format more
//         recent than the server it is being loaded into.
// *Action: Regenerate the data and try again. If you suspect a newer data
//          format, try a more recent version of the IFR server.
5505, "unexpected exception raised during load of '%s': %s"
// *Cause: The server sent back an unexpected/unrecognized exception when
//         attempting to load the specified file/directory.
// *Action: Check pathnames, network state, etc. and try again. It may
//          be necessary to restart and reload the server.
5506, "unexpected exception raised while attempting to get load list: %s"
// *Cause: The server sent back an unexpected/unrecognized exception
//         when the client attempted to retrieve the server's load list.
// *Action: The server is either down or in a corrupt state. Restart it.
5507, "shutdown failed - exception received: %s"
// *Cause: mnirctl was unable to shutdown the requested server. Instead,
//         the stated exception was raised. The server may be corrupted
//         or the connection may be down.
// *Action: Kill the server manually.
5508, "load conflict occurred while loading '%s':"
// *Cause: Attempt to load data into the server failed due to conflicts
//         between the existing server contents and the new data. The
//         names of the offending symbols and the nature of the conflict
//         are reported in subsequent messages.
// *Action: If a names is undefined, load a definition into the server.
//          If a name is already defined, do not load the offending file,
//          or restart the server and change it's contents so there is no
//          conflict.
5509, "symbol undefined: %s"
// *Cause: Attempt to load data into the server resulted in an unresolved
//         symbol reference.
// *Action: Before loading the offending file, load a definition of the
//          the specified symbol.
5510, "symbol redefined: %s"
// *Cause: A definition of the given name is already loaded in the IFR.
// *Action: Do not load the offending file, use a different IFR server,
//          or restart the server and change its contents.
5511, "an IFR server with tag '%s' already exists"
// *Cause: There is already a server running with the same tag (implementation
//         id) as the one just started. IFR servers must have unique tags
//         because they do not share data.
// *Action: Use the running server, if it contains the right data. Bring
//          down the existing server, or restart the current one with a
//          different tag.
5512, "unexpected exception raised instantiating a new repository for '%s': %s"
// *Cause: An unexpected exception was raised when the IFR server tried
//         to initialize itself. The server is probably out of memory
//         (unlikely) or memory is corrupted.
// *Action: Restart server.
5513, "IFR data file appears corrupted (unreadable): '%s'"
// *Cause: A file which appeared to be an IFR data file was unreadable.
//         That is, the file had a ".ifr" suffix, but the header or
//         data was unreadable. The file may be corrupted, may not be an
//         IFR data file, or may not match an IFR data format this server
//         knows how to deal with (e.g. server only understands up to
//         v.2, but the file is v.3).
// *Action: If you believe the file is really an IFR data file, try
//          regenerating it with a version of the compiler you know is
//          compatible with the server. If the file is not an IFR data
//          file, do not attempt to load it (or it's containing directory
//          into the server.
5514, "debugging trace level must be an integer value: %s"
// *Cause: Debugging trace level resource was set to a non-integral value.
// * Action: Correct and restart the server.

5800, "loading '%s' into repository"
// *Cause: Identifies the file/directory currently being loaded into
//         the repository server.
// *Action: None. This is an informational message.
5801, "all requests successfully completed"
// *Cause: Successful completion of requested IFR server operations.
// *Action: None. This is an informational message.
5802, "load failed"
// *Cause: One or more files/directories failed to load into the server.
// *Action: None. This is an informational message. One or more errors
//          should have previously been reported - correct them and try
//          again.
5803, "attempting to shut down server with tag '%s'"
// *Cause: Notification of an attempted shutdown.
// *Action: None. This is an informational message.
5804, "retrieving load list from IFR server with tag '%s'"
// *Cause: Notification of attempt to retrieve server load list.
// *Action: None. This is an informational message.
5805, "interrupt received, got value %d. Quitting"
// *Cause: Program received an interrupt signal.
// *Action: None. This is an informational message.
5806, "IFR server with tag '%s' ready to receive requests"
// *Cause: Notification of startup. OMN environment is initialized at 
//         this point, but nothing else has happened.
// *Action: None. This is an informational message.
5807, "no qualifying IFR data files found"
// *Cause: One or more files/directories were listed on the command line
//         with the -f option, but no files were found to load.
// *Action: None. This is an informational message.
5808, "IFR server loading completed"
// *Cause: Done with the loading phase of server startup.
// *Action: None. This is an informational message.
5809, "IFR server '%s' terminating"
// *Cause: Graceful shutdown of server.
// *Action: None. This is an informational message.

5900, "file '%s' does not appear to be an IFR file, skipping"
// *Cause: Attempt to load a non IFR file. Probably, the header is bad.
// *Action: If you think this is an IFR data file, try regenerating it with
//          a version of the compiler you know is compatible with the server.
5901, "unable to open '%s'"
// *Cause: If a directory, unable to get a list of directory contents.
//         If a file, unable to open the file for reading.
// *Action: Check file/directory permissions.
5902, "IDL entity already defined in the IFR: '%s', from file '%s'"
// *Cause: Attempt to load something in the IFR that was already in there.
// *Action: The only way to remove the exsiting definition is to restart
//          the server.
