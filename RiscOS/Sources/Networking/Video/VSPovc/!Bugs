Outstanding Bugs for VSPovc module
==================================
21mar99 CP
More sucking error handling.
It appears that longjmp can be called after the setjmp data has become invalid!
(Ie. after the function has finished).  Boom!

17mar99 CP
Error handling sucks.  If an error happens there is no guarantee that everything
will be taken down cleanly.  Case in point - watchdog timer activates during SWI
call.  This results in the MediaNet flag being reset.  This causes smnudpPoll to
fail (which means that MediaNet IS running!), and generate a longjmp(), which
will try and call smnudpClose().  This leaves Medianet in an unusual state,
since any further activity will try and restart it.

Also, we have no way of identifying where the error was thrown from in the
longjmp().

15mar99 CP
Sometimes the NIO socket will return an ENOBUFS error when sending data -
particularly when sending Medianet mnIdle packets.  Possible mbuf exhaustion?

9feb99 CP
Client does not appear to be implementing MediaNet keepalive properly.  If video
is streamed for a period exceeding the switch's routing table timeout, then the
switch will  try and discover the destination by broadcasting the video packets!
v3.13 QDF done; code in mx/mn/sosd/riscos/smni.c left untidy (see !VsnInfo
file).

3feb99 CP
Callback mechanism broken - STB and server hangs.

4/9/98 CP
VSP_ReadNPT does not work with Java.  Presumably this is a Java issue rather
than a bug in the module, but it's worth noting.

28/8/98 CP
Handling of 'no NPT' returns from interrogating MPEGTrans stats is not very
good.  Basically, it will cause the video to resume from 0.  Related to the
state of the playback mode state machine :-(

27/8/98 CP
Playback mode state machine is showing extreme software rot, and is borderline
unmaintainable.  Needs to be restructured/redesigned/rewritten.

25/8/98 CP mzswrap.c
It is possible for buffer overflow when using the -server flag.  The
argument is put into a *fixed length* buffer!  If it's too long, the code will
barf.  Marked a couple of places where this could happen.  Also tbuf can
overflow.  The code seems to be full of this sort of thing, so needs to be
carefully checked and fixed sometime.



FIXED BUGS
==========

7/12/98 CP
Module does not interact with new Multicast image (using Internet5 module).
Hangs at end of first video. FIXED - caused by bad error handling.

1/10/98 CP
Module does not work with new internet 5 compatible libraries (even when tagged
Inet4 compatible). FIXED - caused by bad error handling.

4/9/98 CP
SWI handler has no protection from unknown SWIS!  FIXED.

CLI handler does nothing!!  FIXED (removed!)


25/8/98 CP
Trickplay is not always accurately placed.  Sometimes goes to start of file(!),
or can be out by several minutes.

WORKAROUND.  The stream carries NPT information in the PMTs.  There is no
standard minimum interval for these, so some streams will result in stale
timings from the MPEG stats call.  So, if the MPEG value is behind the STB value
by an unacceptable amount (currently 5 seconds), use the STB estimate of time,
otherwise use the stats value.

Note that trickplay streams have PMTs after every I frame, so provide extremely
accurate timing information; it is the transition to trickplay that gives
inaccuracies.
