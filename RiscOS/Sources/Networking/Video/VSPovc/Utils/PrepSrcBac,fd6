| Get rid of MediaNet stuff we don't need from an imported copy of the
| source with .c, .h and .idl files moved into appropriate directories
| with their extensions stripped. Note that some foreign makefiles,
| path setting scripts and so-on will be removed - it is worth keeping
| an unchanged copy of the sources to hand for later reference.
|
| Alter IDL files so that #include "xxx.idl" becomes #include "xxx".
| Unlike the C compiler, our IDL compiler port doesn't understand
| reversing 'xxx.idl' to 'idl.xxx' (or even turning '.' into '/') so
| it'll fail unless we do this.
|
| RISC OS specific parts of code which go into the 'sosd' directories
| in the MediaNet source tree are copied from OMN-RISCOS to OMN by a
| rule in the main Makefile, so that doesn't need to be done here.

| History
| =======
|
| 20-Apr-1999 (ADH): Created. Should ideally become a Makefile target
|                    at some point rather than a hacky script file
|                    full of hard coded relative paths.
