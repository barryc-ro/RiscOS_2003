/*
 * yotk - Typecode Definitions
 *
 * Typecodes are an encoded form of describing the structure of possible data
 * values that can be manipulated by the object layer. They are generally
 * constructed by the IDL compiler, but may be synthesized dynamically.
 *
 * The IDL compiler generates function declarations for retrieving typecodes
 * for all of the defined structures. These functions typically are only
 * used by the marshalling code in the libraries provided by the server
 * vendors, who may or may not choose to use these suggested function names.
 *
 * In other words, functions which return yotk* should not be called by
 * anyone unless they are creating a network layer and implemeting those
 * functions themselves.
