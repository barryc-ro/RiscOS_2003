Miscellaneous MediaNet sources, 21-Apr-1999
===========================================

These source files are extra components of MediaNet which don't
seem to fit in anywhere else. I can't find them in the sources on
the client or server CDs and whilst some/all may say they are
auto-generated from IDL, they have been modified since then (e.g.
skeleton code has been filled in).

If copied over the main MediaNet tree, the directory structure here
should ensure that all files end up in appropriate places. Ideally
this directory will eventually disappear, since its existance flags
failure to identify the origin of all of the source code here.
