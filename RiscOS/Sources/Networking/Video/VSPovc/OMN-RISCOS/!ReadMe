RISC OS specific MediaNet sources, 21-Apr-1999
==============================================

These files form the RISC OS specific components of MediaNet. Whilst
it is possible to export these into the main MediaNet source tree
(where in one sense they belong) in a Makefile rule and clean up
afterwards, it is pointless having two copies of the sources when
the ones here can be readily accessed by appropriate path variables
(see SetPaths). Consequently, the source structure here represents
the minimum required to hold RISC OS specific MediaNet components,
in a tree which, if copied over the main MediaNet tree, would place
all files in the correct place.
