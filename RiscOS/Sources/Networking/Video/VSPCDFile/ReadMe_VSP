Here are common sources for version 0.04 of VSPCD/VSPFile. When assembled
VSPFile 0.04 should be identical to VSPFile 0.03, apart from the date and
version number.

I know of one outstanding problem but you may not care about it as it does
not affect reading video data: on white/green book CDs, some (2?) mixed mode
files (i.e. files containing both mode 2/1 and mode 2/2 blocks) start with a
mode 2/1 block rather than a 2/2 block. Since VSPCD only checks the mode of
the first block, it will be fooled by this. A quick hack would be to check
the first two blocks before deciding on the mode to use. Clearly, this is
not foolproof...

I hope the build sequence is self-explanatory. I would have liked to merge
the two makefiles but I went for a quick solution - I can sort this out if
you want me to.

Please let me know how you get on.
