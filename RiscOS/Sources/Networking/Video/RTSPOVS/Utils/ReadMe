Ticket test system                                           04-Dec-2001
==================                                           ===========

In the absence of any ticketing server, ticket support can be tested by
reading up on and setting the GENERATE_FAKE_INTERNAL_RESPONSES flag in
the Status.c file, and using the TicketTest BASIC program. This will
make RTSP OVS send out a series of commands which match up to a series
of responses that get generated internally. These responses are hard
coded and based on a packet dump from a real session between a
Thirdspace OVS installation and the Oracle Video Client.

The comments in Status.c describe the response strings that are expected
to be generated by RTSP OVS. Other parts of the commands may deviate
from the header dump in minor ways (such as differences in the range,
speed or scale values). At the time of writing, the module passes the
tests by raising the correct responses to the server's challenges.

A tidied up version of the original packet dump is in 'AuthHdrs'.
