PlugPlay ReadMe 03-Apr-2000
===========================

The TaskObey files prefixed with Mk make the targets in the Makefile
which are constructed as part of a ROM build, apart from !MkClean and
!MkClnAll. Others make specific name variants of the main application
- it is possible to have builds which even have different names as
well as compilation options, should you need this. The INSTDIR,
SYSTEM, TARGET and rule to run will be obvious from the various files
as listed below:

  TaskObey    Object dir    Base name    End result

  !Mk         oppz          PlugPlay     RAM module
  !MkRom      oppz          PlugPlay     ROM module
  !PlugPlay   opp           PlugPlay     Application
  !PlugPlayD  oppd          PlugPlay     Debug application

Your exported item is placed in the "Targets" directory.

There's a debug RAM module notionally available based on PlugPlay
which builds into "oppdz", but that's not currently exposed through
a TaskObey file. !MkInstall is a generic build rule to export the
ROM module.

To make every non-module non-debug build available, use !All. To make
every non-module debug build, use !AllD. To clean temporaries but
leave exported applications and symbols tables intact, use !MkClean.
To clean absolutely everything, use !MkClnAll. Dynamic dependencies
in the Makefile are stripped in both cases.

VersionNum is used purely as a tracking mechanism for CVS. Version
numbers in here have no bearing on in-application information. This
comes from the Messages file of whatever variant you're building; see
"Base name" in the table above.
