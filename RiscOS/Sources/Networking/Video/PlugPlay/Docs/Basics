* Operation in plug-in mode
  =========================

When in plug-in mode, the browser is expected to be running JavaScript
code that handles all video setup and manipulation besides scaling.
When the plug-in starts it embeds a blank window filled with whatever
colour will be transparent under Video Control defaults for 256 colour
or lower screen modes, or black with the transparency bit(s) set for
16 and 32bpp screen modes.

The plug-in is launched via. an OBJECT element. Currently, filetype
&BF8 is used as the launch key, so the system's MimeMap file should
contain at least one of the following lines:

  video/mpeg		MPEG		bf8	.mpeg	.mpg	.mpv
  video/x-mpeg2		MPEG		bf8

The TYPE attribute of the OBJECT element can then carry a value of
either "video/mpeg" or "video/x-mpeg2". The OBJECT must enclose at
least one PARAM element, with 'NAME="id"' and 'VALUE' holding some
unique string identifier which the JavaScript code knows about - this
is how the plug-in, on reception of broadcast messages by the
JavaScript code, can identify which of potentially many currenly open
plug-in instances is affected.

A 'STANDBY' attribute should be used with text related to the video
clip in use if possible. 'WIDTH' and 'HEIGHT' are mandatory. The DATA
attribute should be set to the RTSP URL of the video clip being played.

For example:

  <OBJECT TYPE="video/mpeg"  STANDBY="Eagle Eye Cherry"
          WIDTH="320"        HEIGHT="240"
          DATA="rtsp://neptune.eng/asset/mds%3a/mds/video/eagleeye.mpi">

    <PARAM NAME="id" VALUE="eagleeye">

    The video plug-in is not installed, or is incorrectly installed.

  </OBJECT>

The software will not quit a Message_PlugIn_Close is received with bit
0 of the flags at offset 20 in the block is set. Only the instance to
which the message refers is closed. This is because other services
are provided (such as full screen playback) so it is inappropriate to
quit just because plug-in functions are no longer required. Similarly,
if there are no active plug-in instances, the software keeps running.


* Operation as a helper application
  =================================

Upon seeing an ANT URL or Acorn URI broadcast holding a URI with a
scheme of "mpeg2ts", "mpegv" or "rtsp", full-screen playback is
started. In the case of the first two URIs, the OMN_ADDR system
variable is read to aid in construction of an equivalent RTSP URL. The
playback is single-tasking and runs in the Video Control default
resolution in 4 colours for any non-"rtsp://" URL, else it runs in the
current screen depth and resolution and multitasts. Playback is
terminated automatically at the end of the clip or when the user asks
it to be stopped.

* Player parameters
  =================

All parameter names are case insensitive. Parameter values are not.

  name          Plug-in ID name (mandatory)   <n/a>

  border        Border, pixels, -ve=overscan  0

  fontname      RISC OS font name             Homerton.Medium
  fontx         X size in pts * 16            228
  fonty         Y size in pts * 16            228
  fontcolor     RRGGBB hex specified colour   00FF00
  fontcolour    RRGGBB hex specified colour   00FF00

  controller    We handle playback: yes|no    no (plug-in), yes (URL)
  fullscreen    Full screen/window: yes|no    no (plug-in), yes (URL)
  singletask    If controller=yes; yes|no     no

  demux         0-Auto, 1-MPEG 1, 2-MPEG 2    0

The following act in the same way as the old BASIC player arguments of
the same name, and may also be specified through the old-style
MPEGV/MPEG2TS/MPEG1SS URLs.

  from          Starting NPT (seconds)        Start of clip
  to            Approx. ending NPT (seconds)  End of clip
  loop          Loop playback? yes|no         no

  volume        Starting volume setting       256 (full volume)
  noaudio       Switch off audio; yes|no      no
  novideo       Switch off video; yes|noo     no

  channel       Channel no. for multicast     First in channels file
  program       Program number for MPEG2TS    1

Full screen controller playback takes place automatically when
launched by URL rather than as a plug-in. In this case there is some
translation of the old MPEG URL scheme from the previous player as
listed above. RTSP URLs, however, cannot legally carry such data.
Consequently the application-defined query string is used to specify
parameters by 'name="value"&name="value"&...'. For example:

  rtsp://neptune.eng/bondclip.mpi?fontname="Trinity.Medium"&loop="yes"


* Appendix A: General out of memory error message numbers
  =======================================================

These errors are raised internally through the make_no_memory_error
function in Utils.c. The error message is looked up through the
NoMemGen token in the Messages file and is typically of the form
"There is not enough free memory to continue this operation" with a
number in brackets following the error text. The number indicates the
point of failure:

0    malloc for plugin_instance or related structures / data failed
     (PlugIn.c)
1    RMA claim for application name for filter failed and RMA system
     did not raise an error about it (should never happen, Main.c)
2    RMA claim for filter code failed and RMA system did not raise an
     error about it (should never happen, Main.c)
3    malloc for filter structure failed (Filter.c)
4    malloc for overlay structure / associated text failed (Overlay.c)
5    malloc for pixel translation table failed (Overlay.c)
6    malloc for play session structure failed (Play.c)
7    malloc for channel name failed (FullScreen.c)
8    malloc for new URL for channel change failed (FullScreen.c)
9    urlutils_return_description for URL copy during full-screen
     playback returned NULL (FullScreen.c)
10   Various allocation problems when trying to (re)construct a URL
     for channel changing (FullScreen.c)
15   A queue entry could not be claimed in the URI dispatcher
     (URLUtils.c)
22   A claim failed in the RMA allocation routines (RMA.c)
30   malloc for a canonical path failed (Utils.c)
31   malloc for temporary path in utils_build_tree failed (Utils.c)
