The MimeMap module
==================

The MimeMap module provides a central service for mapping between RISC
OS file types, MIME content types and 'dot' extensions to file names.

When the module is loaded it reads the file <Inet$MimeMappings> and
stores the parsed file internally.  When ever the user tries to
perform a mapping operation the file is checked to see if it has
changed, the file is re-read if it has, and the translation is
performed from the interally held data.

At the moment the module can handle 4 different file typing schemes:
RISC OS file type by number, RISC OS file type by name, MIME content
type string and file extension string.  Any type can be converted to
any other type.

The module is usually driven through a single SWI, MimeMap_Translate.
On entry:
	r0 = Input format
	r1 = Input data or buffer
	r2 = Output format
	r3 = Output data buffer (if needed)

On exit:
	r0-r2: Preserved
	r3 = Result or output buffer

The 4 formats supported are:

#define MMM_TYPE_RISCOS		0 /* RISC OS file type passed as an int */
#define MMM_TYPE_RISCOS_STRING	1 /* RISC OS file type passed as a char* */
#define MMM_TYPE_MIME		2 /* MIME content type passed as a char* */
#define MMM_TYPE_DOT_EXTN	3 /* File extention (no dot) as a char* */

There is also a command line interface to the module.  The MimeMap
command can either be given on its own to list all the known types or
it can be followed by &xxx to map a RISC OS file type in hexadecimal,
.ext to map a file name extension, major/minor to map a MIME content
type or a simple string to look up for a RISC OS file type.
