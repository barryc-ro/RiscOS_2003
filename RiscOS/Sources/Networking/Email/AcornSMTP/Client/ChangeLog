CVS tag:	rwarren_AcornSMTP_Client-0_30

Replace my email address in the Fatal internal error string with "NetFax"
plus white space to pad it out to the same size.

Version:	0.29

Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_AcornSMTP_Client-0_29

Added same fix for initial socket connection that I missed in 0.26.
Changed the re-entracy mechanism into the FSMs to what should be secure.
Perhaps this will fix PAN-01995.

===============================================================================
Version:	0.28
Date:		1998-05-18
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_AcornSMTP_Client-0_28

Fixed Debug build.  DebugLib initialisation added in module initialisation.
Cleaned up the setting of callbacks from the eventhandler and the cleaning
up of pending ones on exit from the GET, SEND and SENDLINE FSMs.  There was
a small chance before that a callback could be set into an FSM that had
terminated.

===============================================================================
Version:	0.27
Date:		1998-04-08

Fixed to work with servers that return multi-line responses to commands
(PAN-01821).
