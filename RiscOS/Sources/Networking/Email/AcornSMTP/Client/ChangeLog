===============================================================================
Version:	0.33
Date:		1998-01-05
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_AcornSMTP_Client-0_33

Fixed fault which was introduced by a change in EmailLib 0.48 (change to
expired() function), but wasn't noticable in most test cases.  Problem would
only show up where DNS resolution took a noticable amount of time.  Module
would stay in a tight loop in SVR mode instead of releasing control to USR
mode.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.32
Date:		1998-11-11
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_AcornSMTP_Client-0_32

Service_WimpCloseDown support added.  If the client passes its taskhandle on
Register, then if the client subsequently dies without calling DeRegister
first, the module can clean up.  Only works for clients which register for
WimpMessage notification.  Support needs to be added to the module in the
future to do this for Wimp apps. that don't request WimpMessage notification.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.31
Date:		1998-08-24
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_AcornSMTP_Client-0_31

WimpMessage support fixed.

C Veneer has:
 * _AcornSMTP_WimpRegister() for registering for Wimp Messages to be sent
   when pollword is set.
 * BOOL replaced with bool from Email/bool.h
 * extern "C" added for C++ compilers
 * enum for error numbers added
 
Internal error string INTERNALERR contents is now build time configurable.
By default it is "Report to Acorn Computers".  If Daytona is the System, then
"Report to NetFax".

Makefile targets for McCabe and TaskObey files changed.

===============================================================================
Version:	0.30
Date:		1998-06-24
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_AcornSMTP_Client-0_30

Replace my email address in the Fatal internal error string with "NetFax"
plus white space to pad it out to the same size.

===============================================================================
Version:	0.29
Date:		1998-06-03
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_AcornSMTP_Client-0_29

Added same fix for initial socket connection that I missed in 0.26.
Changed the re-entracy mechanism into the FSMs to what should be secure.
Perhaps this will fix PAN-01995.

===============================================================================
Version:	0.28
Date:		1998-05-18
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_AcornSMTP_Client-0_28

Fixed Debug build.  DebugLib initialisation added in module initialisation.
Cleaned up the setting of callbacks from the eventhandler and the cleaning
up of pending ones on exit from the GET, SEND and SENDLINE FSMs.  There was
a small chance before that a callback could be set into an FSM that had
terminated.

===============================================================================
Version:	0.27
Date:		1998-04-08
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_AcornSMTP_Client-0_27

Fixed to work with servers that return multi-line responses to commands
(PAN-01821).
