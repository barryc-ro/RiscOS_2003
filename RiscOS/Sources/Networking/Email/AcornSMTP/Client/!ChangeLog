0.06
====

07/04/97
--------
Makefile	0.02	EXTRAS added to make acornsmtp.o automatically


0.07
====

16/06/97
--------
antlib.c	0.??	open_smtp modified to use ANT Resolver GetHost
			Non-blocking
sendmail.c	0.03	ANT_sendmail changed to cope with changes to open_smtp()
			which can now return EINPROGESS.
			ERROR state added to post_message() so it can return a
			failure code.

0.08
====

20/06/97
--------
Start to implement in non-blocking sockets.

30/09/97
--------
As I've not worked on AcornSMTP for ages and we need a working version I'm
checking the current 0.08 sources to return to them later.  I will then extract
0.06 (the version before non-blocking prototype code was done) apply some
fixes and check it in as 0.09.  Work will carry on from there and I'll
return later to merge the unfinished non-blocking code from 0.08 into the
current version.

0.09
====
Code of 0.06 taken and port number bug fixed.
Build env. changed over to standard RISC OS build env.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.13
====

0.13 is a *major* change from 0.12.  The entire AcornSMTP is effectively
re-implemented.  The code is based on AcornPOP3 0.14's non-blocking FSM
system.  Future effort should be made to move common functionality between
these modules into a library which they, and other protocol modules, can use.

			responses.  However, will only return the last line.
			Need to in future change so that we can return whole

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.28
====

06/05/98
--------
header.cmhg	0.28	increment version number to 0.28
handlers.c	0.08	changed commented out Printf's to dprintf to use
			DebugLib
module.c	0.10	Added DebugLib initialisation if DEBUGLIB defined

18/05/98
--------
get.c		0.06	Only switches process1.state into GET on a EWOULDBLOCK.
			Also, on exit now ensures there is no callafter or
			callback pending
handlers.c	0.09	process1.state switched back to PROCESSING immediately
			before setting the callback to do the processing.
send.c		0.04	Only switches process1.state into SEND on a EWOULDBLOCK.
			Also, on exit now ensures there is no callafter or
			callback pending
sendline.c	0.04	Only switches process1.state into SENDLINE on a
			EWOULDBLOCK.  Also, on exit now ensures there is no

0.29
====

28/05/98
--------
header.cmhg	0.29	increment version number to 0.29
sendmail.c	0.15	moved switch to process1.state CONNECTING to exit from
			CONNECT state where it should be!
			And ensure on end of FSM CallAfter/Backs are removed
			and process1.state = PROCESSING
			Fixed MemCheck faulting on read in GET_HOST_NB
			Re-entracy changes as per cmdresp.c 0.05
smtp_utils.c	0.08	smtp_irqs_off and smtp_restore_irqs added
smtp_utils.h	0.06	smtp_irqs_off and smtp_restore_irqs added

02/06/98
--------
cmdresp.h	0.02	CA_command_response() moved to .c file
cmdresp.c	0.05	in_FSM, pending_CB and need_CB added to context.
			command_response() now sets process1.state to PROCESSING
			to ensure event handler doesn't do anything.
			CB_comamnd_response now checks there is not already a
			pending call back set.  It also checks to see if there
			is an active thread in the FSM.  If yes, it sets a flag
			for that thread to be responsible for setting the
			callback, otherwise it sets it and sets the pending
			flag.  command_response_CAhandler now just calls
			CB_command_response.  command_response_CBhandler now
			sets in_FSM and unsets pending_CB before calling the
			FSM.  command_response_FSM on exit now either:
			FSM end case: resets process1.state and destroys the
			              context
			t_slice expiry: sets a callafter (though callback used
			                for performance just now. Once I pass
			                timeslices between FSMs, I'll change
			                this)
			need_CB set: sets a callback
