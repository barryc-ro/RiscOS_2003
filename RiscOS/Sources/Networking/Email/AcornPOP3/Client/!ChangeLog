			is an active thread in the FSM.  If yes, it sets a flag
			for that thread to be responsible for setting the
			callback, otherwise it sets it and sets the pending
			flag.  command_response_CAhandler now just calls
			CB_command_response.  command_response_CBhandler now
			sets in_FSM and unsets pending_CB before calling the
			FSM.  command_response_FSM on exit now either:
			FSM end case: resets process1.state and destroys the
			              context
			t_slice expiry: sets a callafter (though callback used
			                for performance just now. Once I pass
			                timeslices between FSMs, I'll change
			                this)

logon.c		0.18	notify_progress added to logon_context
			Notifies client of AcornPOP3_CS_Resolving,
			ConnectingSocket, WaitingForGreeting and LoggingIn on
			switch into GET_HOST (or GET_HOST_NB), CONNECT,
			GREETING and USER respectively
			logon_USER_PASS(), notify_progress parameter added.
swihndlers.c	0.13	Register() updated to support global flag setting for
			progress notification of all operations and initialise
			the returned data queue
			DeRegister() updated to destroy the returned data queue
			Logon() updated to support local toggling of progress

pop_utils.c	0.12	notify_client() renamed as send_notification()
			EnQueue(), ProcessQueue() and new notify_client() added.
			notify_client now takes the data and EnQueues, it then
			calls ProcessQueue().
			ProcessQueue() checks to see if pollword is null (ie.
			client is free to receive new data) and takes the head

			parameters.  data is as before, location is set to
			the static data area the client expects data to be at.
			if data is the actual static location, as in normal
			returned data, then set location to 0.  size should be
			set to the size of the data (data and location must be
			of the same size obviously)
!MkClnAll		New Task obey file added which does clean phase, then
			runs stripdepnd, if it exists, on the Makefile
