Added same fix for initial socket connection that I missed in 0.26.
Changed the re-entracy mechanism into the FSMs to what should be secure.
Perhaps this will fix PAN-01995.

Cleaned up the setting of callbacks from the eventhandler and the cleaning
up of pending ones on exit from the GET, SEND and SENDLINE FSMs.  There was
a small chance before that a callback could be set into an FSM that had
terminated.

Sleep time on get FSM increased to 20cs from 1.  Should release CPU to rest
of system more now.  Time slice on get message FSM decreased from 50cs to 20cs.
Time slice is now preserved across re-entracy to get message FSM.
