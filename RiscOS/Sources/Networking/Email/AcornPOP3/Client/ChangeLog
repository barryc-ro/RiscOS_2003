===============================================================================
Version:	0.34
Date:		1998-12-10
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_AcornPOP3_Client-0_34

Fixed fault in the changes made in 0.33 that wasn't caught by the test
harness/test env. used on 0.33.  Problem wouldn't occur depending how much
the byte count returned by the server was off from the actual value and
where in the download buffer we were at the time.

Small, simple fix though.

===============================================================================
Version:	0.33
Date:		1998-11-20
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_AcornPOP3_Client-0_33

Flag added to GetMessage and GetXLinesOfMessage, bit 1.
AcornPOP3_NO_SPACE_CHECKING defined in AcornPOP3.h for it.
If this bit is set it means that for retrival to file (not supported for
memory) the module will not use the filespace size value passed to it in
R3, but will write the data to the file until the end is reached or a file
system error occurs (ie. out of space).

Module initialisation fixed to initialise C++ runtime by calling ______main()
from module initialisation routine.

Tested with test harnesses and with Mailbox library 0.21 in !NCMail.

===============================================================================
Version:	0.32
Date:		1998-11-16
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_AcornPOP3_Client-0_32

Progress information feedback added to Logon process.  Can be requested by
client by either on Register SWI call, or on Logon SWI call.  Register SWI,
setting flag bit 4, switches on all progress information (currently only
logon info).  Logon SWI, flag bit 4, toggles the global settings done on the
initial Register SWI.

bit 4 of all flags words in SWIs is reserved for toggling of progress
information feedback.

Both global and local (Logon SWI) versions tested as well as no logon progress
information as well using test harnesses.

See Docs.Feedback for instructions for use of Progress notification feedback.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.31
Date:		1998-11-11
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_AcornPOP3_Client-0_31

Service_WimpCloseDown support added.  If the client passes its taskhandle on
Register, then if the client subsequently dies without calling DeRegister
first, the module can clean up.  Only works for clients which register for
WimpMessage notification.  Support needs to be added to the module in the
future to do this for Wimp apps. that don't request WimpMessage notification.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.30
Date:		1998-09-18
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_AcornPOP3_Client-0_30

RESOLVERFAILED _kernel_oserror err number incorrect in Module and moved all
errors from NOSPACE onwards out by 1.

===============================================================================
Version:	0.29
Date:		1998-08-24
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_AcornPOP3_Client-0_29

WimpMessage support fixed.

C Veneer has:
 * _AcornPOP3_WimpRegister() for registering for Wimp Messages to be sent
   when pollword is set.
 * BOOL replaced with bool from Email/bool.h
 * extern "C" added for C++ compilers
 * enum for error numbers added
 
Internal error string INTERNALERR contents is now build time configurable.
By default it is "Report to Acorn Computers".  If Daytona is the System, then
"Report to NetFax".

Makefile targets for McCabe and TaskObey files changed.

===============================================================================
Version:	0.28
Date:		1998-06-24
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_AcornPOP3_Client-0_28

Replace my email address in the Fatal internal error string with "NetFax"
plus white space to pad it out to the same size.

===============================================================================
Version:	0.27
Date:		1998-06-03
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_AcornPOP3_Client-0_27

Added same fix for initial socket connection that I missed in 0.26.
Changed the re-entracy mechanism into the FSMs to what should be secure.
Perhaps this will fix PAN-01995.

===============================================================================
Version:	0.26
Date:		1998-05-19
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_AcornPOP3_Client-0_26

Cleaned up the setting of callbacks from the eventhandler and the cleaning
up of pending ones on exit from the GET, SEND and SENDLINE FSMs.  There was
a small chance before that a callback could be set into an FSM that had
terminated.

Sleep time on get FSM increased to 20cs from 1.  Should release CPU to rest
of system more now.  Time slice on get message FSM decreased from 50cs to 20cs.
Time slice is now preserved across re-entracy to get message FSM.

===============================================================================
Version:	0.25
Date:		1998-04-08
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_AcornPOP3_Client-0_25

Build environment tidy ups.  No functionality changes.
