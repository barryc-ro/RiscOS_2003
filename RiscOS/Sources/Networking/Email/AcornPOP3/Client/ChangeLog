WimpMessage support fixed.

C Veneer has:
 * _AcornPOP3_WimpRegister() for registering for Wimp Messages to be sent
   when pollword is set.
 * BOOL replaced with bool from Email/bool.h
 * extern "C" added for C++ compilers
 * enum for error numbers added
 
Internal error string INTERNALERR contents is now build time configurable.
By default it is "Report to Acorn Computers".  If Daytona is the System, then
"Report to NetFax".

Makefile targets for McCabe and TaskObey files changed.

Replace my email address in the Fatal internal error string with "NetFax"

Added same fix for initial socket connection that I missed in 0.26.
Changed the re-entracy mechanism into the FSMs to what should be secure.
Perhaps this will fix PAN-01995.

===============================================================================
Version:	0.26
Date:		1998-05-19
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_AcornPOP3_Client-0_26

Cleaned up the setting of callbacks from the eventhandler and the cleaning
up of pending ones on exit from the GET, SEND and SENDLINE FSMs.  There was
a small chance before that a callback could be set into an FSM that had
terminated.

Sleep time on get FSM increased to 20cs from 1.  Should release CPU to rest
of system more now.  Time slice on get message FSM decreased from 50cs to 20cs.
Time slice is now preserved across re-entracy to get message FSM.
