These files are built in to the NC model 1 ROM (v1.06) and are used by
the Caradon dialler. 

I'm not sure why they are in the NC1 main ROM rather than the dialler
ROM but we use some of them in the ISDN version of Caradon.

These appear to be here for reference only.  They are not used in the
ISDN Caradon build.
