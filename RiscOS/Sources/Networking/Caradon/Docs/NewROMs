                   Making new 'SmartCard' ROMs for modems
                   ======================================

Find share::vbox.$.SmartCard available on your desks network, providing you
have ShareFS installed. Alternatively go to the STB-1 on my desk where it
claims to be ADFS::IDEDisc5.$.SmartCard.

In sources.Cards is an application called !A30, run it and fill in the dialogue
box. By default it fills in the fields for the UKOnline demo2.omi account. If
it is necessary to respond to "login:" style prompts before starting PPP, click
on the 'Script' button and fill and change the fields in that dialogue box. The
defaults here are the minimum needed to get the modem to the point where PPP
can take over. When everything is set, click on 'Create'.

You should land up with a new directory in sources.Cards. Inside this is a
directory 'Caradon'. Drag this to the sources directory where there is an
existing Caradon directory. For safety it is best to delete the contents of
sources.Caradon.o. Double click on the !EnvOmega4 file in share::vbox.$.
SmartCard, then find share::vbox.$.SmartCard.BuildSys.ModemROM.!MkInst and
double click on it. When the activity dies down, you will have a new ROM Image
share::vbox.$.SmartCard.Install.Images.ModemR/008 which can be blown into an
EPROM.
