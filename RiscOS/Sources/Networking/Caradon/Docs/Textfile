A Idiots Guide to the Modem NC
1. Unless you are absolutely certain that the NC has been set with the correct phone number, turn it on with the 'N' key held down. This drops you into a screen allowing you to change the number. Although most keys will be accepted by the dialogue box, only 0-9, 'W', 'P', and ',' will be used by the dialler. The last three are for use from lines needing an outside connection first, the ',' causes a short pause in the dialling, 'W' waits for a second dial tone to be recieved, and 'P' causes the modem to use pulse dialling from then on. eg from Acorn House phone lines, numbers would normally be prefixed with "9," to get an outside line.

If you need an EPROM for a new service provider or account, please ask me for a copy of my script generator, fill in the dialogue boxes with the relevant information, and bring me back the directory it produces so I can produce a new EPROM. If you want to email me the result, Spark it first and mail just the single file, do not under any circumstances drop it onto !EMail and expect me to extract it from there!
