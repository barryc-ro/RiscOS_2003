If the card is locked, then nothing is readable from it until it is
unlocked. So, the first call will return BB_STATUS_PIN and
BB_STATUS_LOCKED. After authorization and a subsequent read, the status
will be BB_STATUS_PIN, and BB_STATUS_LOCKED will be clear. Hopefully,
BB_STATUS_SC_VALID and BB_STATUS_BB_VALID will be set too.

I should be releasing a new registry very shortly indeed. This one can
write stuff as well as read it, and allows you to pass an authorization
string. You can't fake up boot blocks any more - use the smartcard
emulator instead, which'll come with it.

btw, none of this smartcard locking stuff works yet.

Cheers,

Ant
