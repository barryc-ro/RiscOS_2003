How to redial via Caradon
=========================

Monitor for Service Call Service_DiallerStatus (0xB4), this is sent with
R2 == 4 when the PPP module is able to start the IP layer, and R2 == 0
(may be subject to change) if the line is dropped for any reason.

If the line is up, then operations can proceed as normal, if it has gone
down then issue the star command *ReDial and wait for the service call
to indicate the line has come back. Note that the redialling will only
be attempted once, and if it fails the user will be left with one of the
failure screens and a 'try again' button. It should be safe to issue the
*redial even when on line, and it may prove possible (after discussion
with Simon) to send the service call immediately if the system is still
on line.

Any system wishing to redial should call Wimp_Poll as normal and check
the status of the line on a regular basis. Attempting to check from a
non-polling loop will give unpredictable results
