Things needing changing for different service providers...

c.Script
========
Amend expect/send pairs appropriately


Resources.Files.Start
=====================
Set Inet$Resolvers for ISPs DNS
Set Inet$LocalDomain for ISP
Set STBWeb$Welcome to ISPs home page
Set STBWeb$Home to ISPs home page

Resources.Files.PPP.Options
===========================
Alter 'name' line to suit local machine


Resources.Files.PPP.PAPSecrets

This is optional, but if used...
Single line containing machine name, '*', password (may be encoded with
  crypt() apparently, but I haven't tried it!)
