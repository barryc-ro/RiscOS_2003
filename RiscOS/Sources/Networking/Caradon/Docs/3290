Anthony,

Here are the details for the modem CMOS byte. Note that this uses the first
byte of the space temporarily used for storing the telephone number on
development NCs. Also note that the digit in bits 0-3 is stored +1 so you will
have to subtract 1 before using it (this is so that the default value of 0
means "no prefix"). If a prefix digit is specified then your software should
always pause, unless the wait bit is set in which case you should wait instead.

	9E	00	Modem CMOS
			Bits 0-3	Prefix digit + 1 (0 => no prefix)
			Bit    4	Wait for second dial tone
					0 = don't wait
					1 = wait
			Bit    5	Dial type
					0 = tone dialling
					1 = pulse dialling
			Bits 6,7	Not used

Hope this does not cause too many problems.

--Steve
