1. Lose concept of 'Booting'. Multi-stage initialisation instead.

'Desktop' application is in main ROM, sets up with minimal system immediately.
Web browser, Word Pro and whatever else is in ROM (Configure) is available, but no FS exists. Browser has only one page ('Sorry, not connected'), Word Pro warns 'Text cannot be stored', etc., other applications as relevant.

Logon dialogue box for users *server* appears in centre of screen. This is not necessarily the information for a local access point, the NCD should know better where its local access comes from, eg, nearest dial-up point. Phone number and user/password would normally be set from the Configure application, server access user/password will be on a smart card.

Extension ROM on Interface card either connects immediately (Ethernet, ATM) or waits to be commanded (modem). When dial-on-demand PPP module is available this will be used instead for modem connections.
