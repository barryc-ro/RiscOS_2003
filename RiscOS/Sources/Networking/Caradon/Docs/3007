A version of the registry of sufficient functionality for most testing
purposes is available in /projects/spinner/Sources/Ant/Registry.

Read the file "README!!" in said directory before proceeding. Also, note
that the spec. which covers the boot block contents has changed slightly,
so have a shufti at http://om78/ncdocs/bootblock_frame.html .

I'm away on monday, so I'll fix any bugs y'all find on tuesday.

Snugs,

Ant
