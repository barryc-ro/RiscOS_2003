Frosty,

I'm now very close to being able to give you something to read scripts
from, although the actual smartcard interface still isn't ready.
Hopefully, you'll have it by close of play tonight, or friday if not
(I'm not here tomorrow).

The basic s.p. will be:

You issue a SWI, NCRegistry_Enquiry, where:
	r0 -> "SEND_EXPECT"
	r1 -> return buffer
	r2 = size of return buffer, or 0 to get size of SEND_EXPECT data

and you get back:
	r0 = size of returned data, or -N for error
	r1 = source of data [1=Net bootblock, 2=s/c boot block]
	r2 preserved

and the buffer contains the SEND_EXPECT field if r2 was big enuff on
entry.

The buffer will contain a linked list of the ff. structures:

typedef struct {
  unsigned int cntrl;
  char *string;
  SCRIPT_LIST *next;
} SCRIPT_LIST;

where next == NULL marks the end of the list.

cntrl & 0xff gives you the command type:
  0x1 - expect
  0x2 - send
 [0x3 - pause
  0x4 - read IP addr.]

You're probably not interested in the last two.

cntrl & 0xff00 gives you a timeout value in seconds - not sure if you're
interested in this.

string, clearly, points to a string, either to be sent, or expected.

Obviously, this will all have completely changed by the time I release
it, but it'll give you some idea of what to _expect_ (geddit? :).
