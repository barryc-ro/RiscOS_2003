Caradon ISDN Dialler v0.14

This version of Caradon has been modified for use with ISDN.
It is based on the modem Caradon v1.14. The version number has not been
incremented as it would presumably clash with later versions of the modem
Caradon and the only changes have been to make it work with ISDN.

See module.c for more info.

-----------------

This version of Caradon originally came from Anthony Frost who says
it is version 0.14.  However, it differs from version 0.14 in the SrcFiler,
and there is no version 0.14 in CVS, so who knows what version this really is.

CHANGES:

  Makefile:
    Link against Internet 5 libraries.
    Explictly use cmhg version 5.02 (later version are incompatible).
    
  
  Sennen:
    Directory added with version of Sennen that is claimed to be built into
    Caradon 0.14.
