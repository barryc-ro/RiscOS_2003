EMC / RFI Options for Networking on Heron E (and RoadRunner).

1)    Ignore altogether, this has the advantage of zero cost and zero
    effort.  However if we decide later in the product life that EMC /
    RFI is an important consideration then it may cost more to add
    changes later.

2)    Provide filtering on the main board for all the lines on the 15
    way 'network' connector.  This can be provided in one of two ways,
    either fit a filtered 15 way D connector or add filter components
    to the main PCB between the 15 way D connector and the internal
    strip connector.  The former has the advantages that it requires
    no changes to the PCB layout and artwork, and that the filtering
    is as close as possible to the outside of the machine.  However it
    will probably cost more.  **  Price information to follow  **. 
    The latter has the advantages that individual lines can be
    filtered as appropriate and that the price of filtration is lower. 
    The disadvantages are that the filtration may not be as effective
    due to the fact that the filter components will not be very close
    to the external connector and will have to run past the unfiltered
    signal lines.  e.g.

      It should be noted that using a filtered connector means that
    that choice (to filter or not) can be made at production time and
    that a non-filtered version is possible.  Using filter components
    on the PCB means that they must always be fitted, since signals
    flow through them.

3)    Let each individual networking board add its own filtering as
    appropriate.  Advantages here
