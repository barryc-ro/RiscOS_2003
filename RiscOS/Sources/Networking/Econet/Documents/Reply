  I don't follow.  The changing of file servers is a slow thing.  I
don't think it likely that file server names that are unique one
minute will be non-unique the next.  Any file server name thought to
be non-unique (as a result of being in the *ListFS list twice) will
always be canonicalised as Net#nnn.ss::<DiscName>.{$|&}...  This would
be achieved by copying the "NastyName" flag across from the name
binder to the context record initialiser and/or by explicitly marking
logons which have had the address forced e.g.

        *Logon [:]nnn.sss <UserName>
        *Logon :Name@nnn.sss <UserName>


NetFiler will probably need changing to use these forms of file server names
when logging on. It will also need changing to allow the opening of filer
viewers of identically named file servers. Currently it produces two
identically named file server icons, but clicking on one is the same as
clicking on the other: they do not produce viewers of their respective file
servers.


If the above change is not made, there are two proposed changes which
partially address the problem and might be quicker to introduce. They do NOT
fully fix the fault.

1. When an ambiguous name is presented to NetFS, it could be made to choose
the highest net number version of the ambiguous file server name. Bruce has
an experimental version of NetFS with this change made. For AUN, this should
generally have the effect of forcing traffic over Ethernet whenever there is
a choice of Econet and Ethernet. This does not address the issue of two
distinct file servers (i.e. physically different machines with the same file
server name).

2. Whenever the current file server is changed (either by a a logon or by
the issue of a *FS command, a binding could be created between the name and
address used in that change. Subsequent uses of the file server name would
be mapped to the address previously bound. This could be used in conjunction
with the partial fix described above.


Even if the "correct" change is not made to NetFS at this stage, it seems
very likely that it will become necessary in due course. Not fixing it until
Blue is produced will introduce a considerable delay for users and Keith
believes it may be required before then, for Acorn internal use, anyway.
Currently, selection of a file server whose name is ambiguous causes "Not a
heap block" errors, suggesting that corruption of the RMA is taking place,
leaving the machine in a very precarious state. At the very least, I believe
that this should be investigated so that the module causing it can be
identified and the circumstances in which it happens be characterised fully.
The presence of this fault may be sufficient reason to issue a soft-loaded
NetFS, so we could take the opportunity to correct the fault properly.
