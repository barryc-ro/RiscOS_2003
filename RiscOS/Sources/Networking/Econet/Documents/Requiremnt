                Requirement specification for an Econet Expansion Card.
               =========================================================

          The Victoria project requires that Econet be available as an upgrade
        to the machine.  Since Victoria does not support the current internal
        module upgrade for Econet a fully compliant Expansion Card is
        required.

          It is required that this Expansion card provides Econet access for
        the Victoria computer and that it conforms to all Econet 'standards'
        i.e. that it should interact correctly with all existing Econet
        products.

          It is required that the Econet Expansion Card provide the exact same
        facilities as the Econet module and RISC OS ROMs provide for previous
        RISC OS machines i.e. no extra software programs or configuration.

          It is required that the Econet Expansion Card is available (in Coral
        Park) before the launch of Victoria.
