- The loading of the netscape RC4 encrypted key is a crock of pig pellets.
  It will be reworked along with a nice general mechanism for encrypting
  ASN.1 stuff. [ Jun 96 ] I've cleaned up private keys internally but
  still have not done PKCS#8 support.

- Winsock support in s_client/s_server for windows nt/3.1 is a crock.
  I will probably not get this fixed for a while, it is just there so
  I could test things.

* Multi-threaded support, I've started...

+ Implement SSL v 3, I will actually soon be looking at starting (he
  says for the 20th time :-).

- Be able to generate DSS certificates.

- Add CRL to the X509 verification stuff, this will probably be added with
  SSLv3.
  
* BIO filters and endpoints.  Currently only really sockets and file pointers
  have been tested.  I need to test all the other ones and add an
  encryption filter.

+ X509 callback.  I need to callback the application to retrieve certificates
  and CRL.

- Improve the maths libraries (esp a^b%m).  I'm coming to the conclusion
  that it may not be worth the effort.  The 'best' appear to only be
  %30 faster and the amount of time I would have to spend would not be worth
  it unless I got payed :-).  I know the algorithms, it's just time.
