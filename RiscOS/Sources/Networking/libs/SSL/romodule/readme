This directory holds the extra interface layers to create a RISC OS module
from the ssllib and cryptolib.

The client application links with sslmodule.o which contains the necessary
code to cross the module interface. The standard header files are used
during compilation of a client.

ssldesp performs the despatching from the SWI interface through to the actual
calls in the library.


The module is compiled non-reentrant for use as user-mode code. A SWI
provides initialisation of a table the user-mode supplies as part of
its initialisation.
