Testing Code
============

"Enumerate" will test SWI URL_EnumerateSchemes.  The output should list
the same information as *URLProtoShow (the *-command reads the data
structures directly and does not use the SWI code internally)

"URLClient" will test the URL parsing and is normally used with a test
script such as the URLs file provided.  Read URLs file for usage details.

"TestParse2" will test URL_ParseURL 2 - the reconstruction of a full URL
from its constituent parts.

"PathWrite" will test the .. and . handling in the URL resolver.

"speedtest" will attempt 2000 resolves (give single numeric argument to
override) and report how long it took with the "slow" resolver (reason
codes 0 and 1 to URL_ParseURL) and with the "quick" resolver (reason code 3).

"RunAllTest" will run URLClient against the three test files and then run
the URL_ParseURL 2 test (reconstruction of URLs from constituent parts)
