/* This function initiates the sending of a command on the command socket.
 * It needs to know the command to send (minus the \r\n) and the state into
 * which to go when the transmission is completed.  Usually this will be
 * immediately, but you never know.  Doing it this way all the time makes
 * the code smaller and less complicated anyway.
 *
 * If "next_state" is negative, then "-next_state" will be entered immediately
 * upon completion of command transmission.  Otherwise, protostate_RECEIVING_RESPONSE
 * is entered and the value of next_state passed on to command_recv as the
 * next state.  Hence, callers can say things like:
 *      commands_send(s, FTP_GOT_SYST_RESPONSE, "SYST")
 * and know that by the time the state moves to FTP_GOT_SYST_REPONSE, the command
 * was sent successfully, and the server's response was received and decoded and
 * can be examined by looking at Session.response_code to determine whether it
 * succeeded or not.
