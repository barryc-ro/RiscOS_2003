AcornSSL
========

This module provides SSL encryption services for the AcornHTTP module.  It is
not a self-contained fetcher module.  Whilst it is loaded, the AcornHTTP
module will ensure that the https: URL protocol scheme is registered with the
URL Module.  The AcornHTTP module handles all the interaction with the
URL fetching systems, all the HTTP protocol things, in fact everything except
that encryption.


Details
=======

The AcornSSL module issues a service call (URL_SSL_AVAILABLE 0x83E02) when it
is first initialised.  It sets a callback which re-issues the service call
which will go off after the module is in the module chain (and can hence
be `seen' by other modules).  The service call is also issued whenever
AcornSSL notices the "http:" protocol scheme being registered with the URL
module.  This is intended to allow maximum flexibility, and ensures that if
both the AcornHTTP and AcornSSL modules are in the RMA, then both http: and
https: schemes are registered and that if AcornSSL is not present, https: is
not registered.
