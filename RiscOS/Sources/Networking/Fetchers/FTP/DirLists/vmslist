James Slodzik explains:

The bit in square brackets is the username (make sure you use a case
insensitive compare). The bit is parentheses is the permissions:

	(System, Owner, Group, World)

	R = Read, W = Write, E = Execute, D = Delete

Execute permission on a directory is the same as in Unix (i.e., search but
not read). Deleting a file or directory needs write permission to the
directory it's in as well as delete permission to the file or directory
itself. Everything else does exactly what you'd expect it to.
