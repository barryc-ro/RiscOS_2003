Change Log:
===========


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.17 Wed 06-Mar-96        Kevin Bracey                  

Checked in to source filer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.20 Tue 12-Aug-97        Carl Elkins                   

Force version number to sensible value, given that 0.18, 0.19 & 0.20 were not
checked into source control.

0.18 - non-functional
0.19 - binary hacked 0.17
0.20 - non-functional hack of 0.18

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.21 Tue 12-Aug-97        Carl Elkins                   

Developed from 0.17 sources : fixed couple of potential memory corruption
bugs, which could lead to undesirable machine crashes ;-)

Added returning of 'Content-Type:' header field to cope with small number of
filetypes. This is presently coded as a switch statement, since we don't yet
have a type-mapper available ; also needs a 'default' added.

Suspect that the 'status' call r3 return value is incorrect, but don't want
to change it without confirmation of how browser uses it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.22 Fri 19-Sep-97        Carl Elkins                   

Failed to check in sources for 0.22 :-( but let's keep version numbers in
sync...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.23 Fri 19-Sep-97        Carl Elkins                   

Now uses the ANT Mime Mapper module to map filetypes to content types.

Also modified build system to remove duplication of version imformation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.24 Fri 03-Oct-97        Carl Elkins                   

Further minor tidying of build.
Minor changes to SWI dispatcher & content type lookup to improve robustness.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.25 Thu 23-Oct-97        Carl Elkins                   

Minor fun with a srcfiler explosion, but it appears to have failed safe.

This version was tidied up, debug code removed, and copyright notices added
to each source file, since it has been released to IMS as example code.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.26 Thu 23-Oct-97        Carl Elkins                   

Principle change being to support the use of a RiscOS compatible, registered
SWI chunk for the ANT MimeMapper module (0x050b00) rather than the previous
unregistered, incompatible (bit 17 set) 0xbcd00.

Other change is re-introduction of the switch() backup, should the MimeMap
SWI call fail (which it will now do correctly, rather than generating an
error), and a minor fix to a status returned value - if retry count is
exceeded, returns aborted with 'fetching data' flags.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.27 Tue 28-Oct-97        Stewart Brodie                

Minor change to add a new error message indicating that the file fetched
was zero length.  Previously, attempting to fetch a zero length file 
generated a "File not found" error.  It now generates "File was empty".


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.28 Mon 10-Nov-97        Stewart Brodie                

Module will now die even if the URL_Fetcher module is not present.  This used
to fail with a SWI not known error for URL_33 (which doesn't appear to have
a proper name...)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.29 Wed 12-Nov-97        Stewart Brodie                

Module now responds to URL 0.18's service call

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.30 Mon 17-Nov-97        Stewart Brodie                

If the file leafname contains a / and the file's type is DOS or Data, then
an attempt is made to use the extension to determine the MIME type before
using the actual filetype.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.31 Tue 18-Nov-97        Stewart Brodie                

If the file leafname is not found but the requested URI leafname has an
extension, then this extension (from the final dot onwards) will be stripped
and the filename sought again.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.32 Thu 04-Dec-97        Stewart Brodie                

Relinked with version 5.06 of the linker (solves ReInit data aborts)
Specific build for December 4 development release.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.33 Wed 17-Dec-97        Stewart Brodie                

Fault in handling R0:1 on FileFetcher_GetData call fixed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.34 Thu 18-Dec-97        Stewart Brodie                

Fix in 0.33 for fault in handling R0:1 was bad.  Now fixed properly.

Specific build for December 18 development release.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.35 Mon 19-Jan-98        Stewart Brodie                

Version 0.31 change backed out and replaced by issuing a permanent redirect
message for the incorrect URI, but only if the extensionless named file
existed.  This means that the client's idea of the URI to the document
remains correct so it can perform the "view source" operation correctly.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.36 Wed 28-Jan-98        Stewart Brodie                

Specifically tagged version for Expresso code freeze on 29-Jan-1998.
