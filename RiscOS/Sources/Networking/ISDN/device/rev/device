v1.2 (13 Aug 97)
----------------
    	- CLEAR codes displayed in decimal instead of hex.(isdnctrl.c)
    	- Bug fix: AT#COUNTRY= without a parameter set wrong default.(isdnctrl.c)  

v1.1 (04 Aug 97)
----------------
    	- COUNTRY_DEFAULT defined depending upon variant being built (US or Europe/Japan)
    	- Auto-answer behaviour changed. ATS0=-1 means don't answer, don't respond to 
    	  calls and don't send ALERTING message to the network. (dd_int.h, isdnctrl.c)
    	- Allows multiple instances of T, t, P or p at start of dial string, instead
    	  of just one, so ATTTD will dial correctly.(isdnctrl.c)
    	- removed switch (Acu_conn_rq_service) routine in isdnctrl as it was
    	  made obsolete by 56k fix.(isdnctrl.c)
    	- added code to check incoming call addressing for MPPP (isdnctrl.c)    	    
    	- Handler now flushes buffers when a stream is about to be closed. This is
    	  important as the OS will wait for the buffers to empty before closing them
    	  and will suspend callbacks while waiting so the buffers would never empty.
    	  (handler.c)

v1.0 (17 Jul 97)
----------------
	Initial version.
