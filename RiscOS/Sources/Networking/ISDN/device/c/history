/* 	Changes to Other Source Files
	-----------------------------

This file descibes the changes that I have made to source files
out of the devices directory.

Wed 23rd April 1997
module.cmhg.header:
  only request module service calls that we need
services.h._serv_por (line 96 onwards):
  Memcpy_far #define'd to RISC OS memcpy function (faster than byte loop)

Thu 24th April 1997
par.h.serv_por changed to #include newtypes.h instead of sys/types.h
newtypes.h added to par directory definining ushort to be unsigned int
rather than unsigned short. This reduced the executable size by 6484 bytes
(on a 300K executable file) and also gives a small speed improvement (around
3%?).
Note sys/types.h is not used at all now.
Added trace to malloc to see if it is being called repeatedly during ISDN
data transfer but it isn't (Omnitel code appears to use pre-allocated buffers
as they suggest).

Check use of os_install_callback next. It appears to be called several times
when RX data received. Is it being called more than is necessary?

Added code to sources.INIT.c.os_accss to prevent multiple callbacks being
requested if a callback was already pending:

_kernel_oserror *os_install_callback()
{
    if (callback_pending) 
      return NULL;
      
    Trace_string("\t\t os_install_callback\n");
    callback_pending = TRUE;	
    return (_swix(OS_AddCallBack, _INR(0,1),
    	isdn_callback_entry,
    	module_wsp));
}

Tue 29th April 1997
module.cmhg.header:	New ISDNlist command to show ISDNctrl log.
module.c.module:	New ISDNlist command
module.h.module:	New ISDNlist command
