Revision_string (_SERVICES_VERSION, "(@)SERVICES v3.68 (17 Jul 97)")

#if 0

v3.68 (17 Jul 97)
-----------------
	- sm.c: corrected update processing:
		- removed a wrong cast in sm_set_update_par(), case
		MEM_PARAM_INTEGER_0_FDFF.
		- for case MEM_PARAM_INTEGER_0_FDFF, the detection of empty
		update, or erased update, was based on the value of the first byte.
		On Intel-like machines, this first byte does not contain the length
		information, but the encoded value.
		Corrected : the detection is now based on the values of both bytes.

	- services.h: added FG_NIL functional grouping value.

v3.67 (01 Jul 97)
-----------------
	- Added 'NUCLEUS PLUS' OS porting:
	  - added NUCLEUS_PLUS value for the OS parameter;
	  - added JPS_THUMB_CC value for the C_COMPILER parameter;
	  (services.h, services.c, serv_por.h, serv_par.h)

	  - To be used with OB_INIT version >= v1.31.

v3.66 (30 Jun 97)
-----------------
	- sm_sts.c : corrected a problem, when the EEPROM size was greater
	  than the buffer size, the EEPROM writes were performed always at
	  address 0.
	- removed useless gnu68/motorola.s file. motorola.asm can be used
	  in place.
	- modified cc_diab/motorola.s and serv_por.h to enable the use of
	  motorola.s with the CC_DIAB compiler.

	- Added ENT_LEC and ENT_MLEC entity codes for LAN-Emulation.
	- Added ENT_MPPP entity code for ML-PPP.
	  (services.h)

v3.65 (09 Jun 97)
-----------------
	- Added 'OMNITEL_OS' OS porting:
		see ob_init/omni_os/omni_os.txt for implementation details.
		!!! requires ob_init version >= v1.30 if used with OMNITEL_OS !!!
		(services.h, services.c, com_proc.c, serv_por.h, serv_par.h)


v3.64 (05 Jun 97)
-----------------
	- Added 'RTEMS' OS porting (services.h, services.c, serv_por.h, serv_par.h)

		- added SM-related TRAP codes.

	- SM:
		- 'Sm_hook_before_config (p_msg)' and 'Sm_hook_after_config (p_msg)'
		  must return a completion code: if it is not OK, then SM goes into
		  Trap ().
		  (sm.c, _sm_par.h)

		- Corrected position of 'Sm_hook_after_config (p_msg)' macro call
		  (it was called too early).
		  (sm.c)

		- _sm_par.h: added an example of the 'Sm_hook_...()' macros under

-----------------

	- SM entity:

		- added software hooks in sm.c:
			- 'Sm_hook_before_config (p_msg)':
				called by SM when it receives its first message, just before
				starting the configuration cycle.
			- 'Sm_hook_after_config (p_msg)':
				called by SM when it receives the last configuration
				confirmation message.
			- 'Sm_hook_any_msg (p_msg)':

				called by SM when it does not recognize a received message.

			See _sm_par.h for details.

			(_sm_par.h, sm.c)

		- removed the 'sm_msg_process()' function from services.c: it is not
		  an OS-related function. This function call has been replaced in
		  sm.c by the SM hook macro 'Sm_hook_sm_report_in ()'.
		  (services.c)

v3.59 (27 Mar 97)
-----------------
	- sm.c, sm.h : extended the update mechanism for the storage of packed
	  digits (type MEM_PARAM_PACKED_DIGIT_STRING).
	  The character '*' can now be stored and is represented by 0x0A.

	- added support for Position-Independant Code (PIC) (services.h):

		- added 'OM_CODE_TYPE' parameter: defines if the code is to be
		  "relocatable" ('OM_RELOCATABLE') or "Position Independant" ('OM_PIC').
		- added 'PIC_CONST' and 'PIC_CONST_ARRAY' symbols to be for constants
		  or tables that are referencing addresses: when using PIC code,
		  these objects have to be dynamically initialised, so they cannot
		  be considered as constants.
		- added 'Pic_...()' macros to make PIC code easier to write:
		  Pic_index, Pic_init_index(), Pic_init_array(),
		  Pic_init_struct(), Pic_init_struct_array(),
		  Pic_init_struct_array_next() and Pic_address().

	- services.h:
		- removed useless OS_RELEASE parameters for Windows
		  (MS_WINDOWS_31 and MS_WINDOWS_95).
		- Windows NT & 95: explicitely #define "BEGIN_WITH_MSG" compile
		  time option to ON, in "OS CONSTRAINTS" section.

v3.53 (08 Jan 97)
-----------------
	- added Windows NT & 95 Porting (services.c, services.h, serv_por.h)
	- services.c (OS == MS_WINDOWS): reserved the GMEM_ZEROINIT flag for
	  PID_VL memory only, in mem_alloc().
	- services.c: for Windows 3.1 porting, put sm_process_msg() under
	  compile time checking. This function then makes part of the windows
	  executable running the server containing the SM entity.
	- to_proc.c : corrected ONE_TIMER_THREAD processing. When a timer was
	  started for a shorter value than the current running timer, the
	  thread was broken and thus previous timers would never expire.
	  Only used in OS9/UNIX like OS.

v3.52 (09 Dec 96)
-----------------
	- serv_por.h: added It_enable()/It_disable() macros for MSC compiler.
	- to_proc.c + services.h: corrected periodic_timer_start() definition
	  and prototype and cell structure definition for the periodic function
	  parameter (specify the pointer to be 'FAR').
	- com_proc.c: corrected alloc_timer_cell() when BLOCK_COUNTING is ON:
	  timer_cell_alloc_counter variable was always incremented, causing
	  trouble when the max threshold is reached.
	- services.c: corrected os_receive_message() for UNIX/OS9. 
	  The function was not always blocking and was returning P_NIL.
	  This shall not occur in the server loop which Trap in this case.
	- services.h + com_proc.c: corrected simul_message() prototype and call.

v3.51 (31 Oct 96)
-----------------
	- Added pSOS+ porting (OS == PSOS_PLUS).
	  (serv_por.h, services.c)

	- Added "NMI" type of access (Non Multiplexed Interface)
	  (services.h)

        - services.h : Added 2 primitives for the D and B channels
          management. These 2 primitives are exchanged between SM and MNS.
          (see ns_int.h (struct mns_service) for internal contents).
            - SM_CHANNEL_MAINT_RQ
            - SM_CHANNEL_MAINT_CO

v3.49 (18 Sep 96)
-----------------
    - services.h: added support of I960 (OM_CPU parameter),
      and IC960CA (Intel "C" ic960CA / CF compiler) (C_COMPILER parameter).

    - com_proc.c: fixed a problem in 'msg_audit_in()' function occuring
      for the I960 processor due to a 16-bytes alignment done on the message
      structure, causing the audit function to copy less bytes of data then
      required: the message data area would not be copied entirely in the
      audit entry, thus loosing some audit information.

v3.48 (16 Sep 96)
-----------------
    - services.h:
        - added ENT_DL_V5 entity id for LAP V.5 protocol variant.

-----------------
    - services.h : added AT&T 4ESS flags : ATT_4ESS and AT4 (alias)
      This version is based on the AT&T TR-41459 August 1995.

    - conf_srv.h: added missing TIMER_PRECISION definition if TIMER_IT is ON.

        - added 'MESSAGE_CAPTURE' parameter (ON/OFF, defaults to OFF):
          used to define the 'Msg_capture()' macro in serv_por.h, called
          at the same time as 'msg_audit_in()' in the services functions.

    - serv_por.h:
        - added AMX/i386-V1.xx support (OS_RELEASE == I386_V1).
        - added usage of MESSAGE_CAPTURE parameter.

    - services.h:
        - Added definition for ATM-FORUM operator P-NNI 1.0:
          ATM_FORUM_P_NNI_1_0 or N10.

          'OS_RELEASE' parameter in serv_par.h.
        - added 'HIGHC' C-compiler definition (MetaWare 'hc386' for Intel
          32-bits processors), used to define the 'C_COMPILER' parameter
          in serv_par.h.

    - services.c: added porting for AMX/I386_V1 OS.

    - it.h: added 'ITC_8259_SLAVE' IT controller support (Intel 8259 in

      if 'timer_process()' was waken-up after more than 1 Omnitel tick,
      then only one slot was processed, delaying the next slots
      processing. Now 'timer_process()' is looping until the internal
      Omnitel tick value has reached the System-tick value.

    - com_proc.c: added calls to Msg_audit_in() macro with 't' value for
      the direction flag just before calls to 'Trap()' regarding messages
      so that we have a trace of the message in the message-audit.

v3.40 (26 Feb 96)
-----------------
    - serv_por.h: added 'Msg_audit_in()' and 'Msg_audit_filtering()' macros

-----------------
    - services.h:
        - corrected 'Bound' macro for Microsoft C compiler (MSC).
        - Allocate a message in the 'Server_main()' macro under SIMULATION
          to avoid a P_NIL pointer access.

    - it.h: added 'ITC_68307' interrupt controller.

    - services.c + serv_por.h: updated OSE/OS68 porting from ENEA DATA.
