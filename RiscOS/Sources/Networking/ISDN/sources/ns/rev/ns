Revision_string (_NS_VERSION, "(@)NS v6.14 (11 Jul 97)")

#if 0

v6.14 (11 Jul 97)
-----------------
		!!! Requires ASN1 version >= v1.6 when ASN1 Module !!!
		!!! is used (when NS_SUPP_SERVICES is set to ON)   !!!

	- NT-side : Turned bad identifier "FACILITY" into "FAC" in ns_snd_da()
	  function to be able to send FACILITY message in a UI frame
	  (using DL_U_DA_RQ DL-service-primitive) (ns_snd.c).

	- QSI :
		- Added missing initialization of a pointer when
		  sending a Facility IE to the line : it could cause
		  an invalid Facility IE or even a Trap in some cases.
		  (net_iess.qsi)
		- Added process of Q-SIG specific operations (defined
		  in standards produced by ECMA) and rejection of some
		  ETSI specific operations that were accepted before.
		  Added corresponding definitions, structures and Macros
		  at NS interface and building and analysis of these
		  operations under simulation.
		  (ns_ssint.h, ns_ssmac.h, ns_ss.qsi, ns_sstab.qsi, ns_ss.eur,
		   ns_sstab.eur, ns_ie_ss.c, ana_nsss.c, sim_cc1.c).
		- Added compile-time options matching each Q-SIG specific
		  supplementary service : "NS_SS_NAME_IDENT", "NS_SS_CALL_TRANSFER",
		  "NS_SS_PATH_REPLACEMENT", "NS_SS_CALL_OFFER",
		  "NS_SS_DO_NOT_DISTURB" and "NS_SS_CALL_INTRUSION".
		  (ns_par.h)

	- corrected some bad end-of-line characters. They could make some
	  preprocessors or compilers fail.

v6.13 (25 Jun 97)
-----------------
	- ETS+VN6 : any HLC IE containing "coding standard" different
	  from "CCITT" is now considered compatible with any BC IE
	  in a SETUP message which is no more rejected. (net_ie.*)


v6.12 (20 Jun 97)
-----------------
	- HKT : Fixed processing of DISC collision. (net_swit.hkt)
	- NTT : Allowed multiple PROGRESS INDICATOR IEs. (net_par, net_spdu)

v6.11 (12 Jun 97)
-----------------
	- VN6: NT-side:

		- accept 'user mode' IE in Alert, Call-Proc, Connect, Release
		  and Rel-Comp messages for any country code (FRANCE or EUROPE).
		  This enhances compatibility with terminals beeing
		  either VN3, VN4 or EURO-ISDN.
		  (net_spdu.vn6)

		- the 'user mode' IE was considered mandatory in a Call-Proc,
		  but it is optional. Fixed.
		  (net_spdu.vn6)

v6.10b (06 Jun 97)
------------------
	- Added definition for information_rq internal structure for E10.
	  This avoids a compilation pb if E10 was compiled alone.

v6.10a (03 Jun 97)
------------------
	- VN6 : Added missing default value for 'second' field in
	  Date-Time IE. (net_ie.vn6)

v6.10 (30 May 97)
-----------------
	- E10+NI2+DMS:
		- Added transparent process of the SPID (BRI, FG_NT_TE).
		- Added Point to multipoint, NT side, state machine
		  (net_swit.e10, ni2, dms).

	- Added USID/TID information in the MNS_EVENT_IN primitive. This
	  information makes sense only if the event_type equals NS_EVENT_SPID_OK.
	  (ns_int.h)

	- Corrected ns_snd_da () routine (network side). An INFO message
	  could have been sent to the user within a DL_U_DA_RQ.
	  (ns_snd.c)

	- Fixed process of a received SSDU that might be incorrect in some
	  cases when IEs were stored with the outgoing transparent mode.
	  (ns_ssdu3.c)

	- QSI :
		- implemented Outgoing transparent mode and added Q-SIG specific
		  Macros to store the IEs in a transparent way.
		  (ns_mac.h, net_mac.qsi, net_par.qsi, net_ie.qsi)
		- Allowed any octet (and not only IA5 characters) in array
		  inside Notification Indicator IE. (mp_ie.qsi, mp_ssdu.qsi)

	- ETS+VN6 :
		- Network-side : Fixed a bug that occurred when Timer T312
		  expired after a TE responded to a broadcasted SETUP with
		  CALL PROCEEDING (or SETUP ACK) and then ALERTING : call
		  was cleared. (net_stat.*)
		- Added optional "second" field in Date-time IE and 1 new Macro
		  to store the IE. (net_mac.*, mp_ssdu.*, mp_ie.*, net_spdu.*)

v6.9 (20 May 97)
----------------
	- QSI :
		- implemented ASN1 encoding/decoding of Q-SIG specific FACILITY
		  IE for Supplementary-Services when NS_SUPP_SERVICES parameter
		  is set to ON : the IE is not passed transparently but is
		  decoded and formatted according to Q-SIG specific structures
		  and also the common SS-specific structures (as in ETSI).
			- ASN1 library is to be used : asn1_enc.c, asn1_dec.c,
			  asn1_prc.c, ber_enc.c, ber_dec.c.
			- new files : net_iess.qsi, ns_ss.qsi, ns_sstab.qsi.
			- ana_nsss.c : Added specific decoding for SUPP SERVICES
			  data inside SSDU.
			- sim_cc*.c, build_cc.qsi : Added building of SS data
			  inside Facility IE.
			- modified files : ns_iess.c, ns_ssint.h, net_mac.qsi,
			  mp_ie.qsi, mp_ssdu.qsi.

		- Channel ID is marked "Mandatory" in SETUP ACKNOWLEDGE
		  message and associated NS_SETUP_ACK_RQ/IN primitives
		  in order to be in conformance with the recommendation.
		  (net_spdu.qsi, tab_ssdu.qsi)

		- Accepted NS_FAC_RQ primitive with Conn ID set to
		  CONN_ID_MANAGEMENT to be able to send FACILITY message
		  containing dummy call reference and acccepted dummy
		  call referencein FACILITY. (net_spdu.qsi, net_err.qsi)

		- Added missing process of received NOTIFY and NS_NOTIFY_RQ
		  primitives in state machine : the process is transparent,
		  i.e. independent from the state of the call. (net_swit.qsi)
		- Added building and analysis of both primitives under
		  simulation. (build_cc.qsi, build_nt.qsi, ana_ns_1/2.c)

		- Added field "D channel indicator" inside Channel ID IE used
		  at NS interface, added 1 codepoint for this field (only 1
		  was allowed before) : D_CHAN ("the channel identified is
		  the signalling channel").
		  (net_mac.qsi, mp_ssdu.qsi, net_ie.qsi, tab_ie.qsi, mp_ie.qsi,
		  net_indx.qsi)

		- Allowed repetition of Notification Indicator IE in
		  primitives. (net_spdu.qsi, tab_ssdu.qsi)

	- RESET CONFIG :
		- Added missing code to release all call resources and not only
		  the resources related to the first call context when
		  receiving a MNS_RESET_CONFIG_RQ primitive. (ns_rcv.c)
		- Removed bad process when receiving a MNS_RESET_CONFIG_RQ
		  primitive if segmentation is used (NS_SEGMENTATION = ON) :
		  release of DL-connection context could cause a system crash.
		  (ns_proc.c)

	- SUPP SERVICES : Added missing process of ASN1 Lengths encoded in
	  the Indefinite Form inside Facility IE.
	  (ns_ie_ss.c, net_iess.ets, net_iess.qsi)

	- ALL NETWORKS : Changed identifier "PAD_xx" used in meta-programs
	  to avoid errors with some compilers (reseved keyword).
	  (mp_ie.*, mp_ssdu.kdd)

	- VN3 : Changed identifier "_CONTROL" used in a meta-program to avoid
	  errors with some compilers (reseved keyword).  (mp_ie.vn3)

	- Added some missing casts to remove compilation warnings when
	  NS_SEGMENTATION is ON. (ns_rcv.c, ns_snd.c)

	- replaced 'class' keyword to avoid warnings with some C++ compilers.

v6.8a (07 May 97)
-----------------
	- NI1+DMS:
	  BRI: make sure the channel Id structure is set with FF before
	  filling out the BRI channel ID IE.
	  NS could have rejected a channel ID coming from CC if the
	  performance flag was not set to OFF.
	  (net_mac.ni1, net_mac.dms)

v6.8 (30 Apr 97)
----------------
	- NI2 : When a call appearance of 0 is sent by CC, NS will force it
	  to 1. This prevents voice calls from being rejected by the network.
	  (net_switc.ni2)

	- corrected # character that was not in first column.
	  (net_switc.ni1, build_cc.kdd)

v6.7 (28 Apr 97)
----------------
	- ETS+VN6 : NT-side : Added test on "p_ns_dl" pointer inside
	  "xxx_internal_process ()" function : it avoids accessing a P_NIL
	  pointer when receiving a NS_CLEAR_RS primitive in state n22 (after
	  a broadcast SETUP has been sent and Timer T303 has expired twice).
	  (net_swit.*)

	- Supp Services : Total number of Facility components allowed in a SPDU
	  is now a parameter to be tuned by customer : it is defined with
	  "NS_MX_FAC_COMPONENTS" define which has been moved into ns_par.h file.
	  (ns_par.h, ns_ssint.h)

	- RESET_CONFIG :
		- Release all call resources (with "call_clear ()" function) and
		  not only saved SPDU when receiving a MNS_RESET_CONFIG_RQ
		  primitive: some resources could not be free when the restart
		  procedure were not used (in particular call timers).
		  (ns_rcv.c)

		- NS_MAINTENANCE_CAPABILITY : ns_update_nfas () : Free the H code table
		  which gives the right NA thru a call reference when the Nai bearing
		  the D channel is to be freed. (ns.c, ns_proc.c)

	- ETS : Supp Services : Allowed value of problems inside Reject component
	  different from the ones described in ETS 300 196.
	  (net_ie.ets, tab_ie.ets, net_indx.ets, net_iess.ets)

	- Changed "class" into "restart_class" inside "mns_restart" structure
	  to avoid compilation warning with some compilers. (ns_int.h) 

v6.6 (18 Apr 97)
----------------
	- ETS+VN6+VN3+QSI+SWD+BV1+AU1+NTT+KDD+HKT+A11+A17+BIP :
	  Added performing of outgoing restart procedure (RESTART
	  message and NS_RESTART_IN primitive sent) when receiving
	  MNS_RESTART_RQ primitive even if no call is in progress
	  or active (Restart Request was confirmed without performing
	  restart procedure).  (net_swit.*)

v6.5 (15 Apr 97)
----------------
	- KDD+SWD+BV1+BT2+A11+A17:
		- Modified code so that it is compatible with PIC implementation
		  (Position Independent Code) : Modifications are the same
		  as in ETSI variant (see version v6.0).
		  (pic_nsie.c, pic_ssdu.c, net_ie.*, net_ssdu.*, net_spdu.vn6
		  and new files : tab_ie.*, tab_ssdu.*, mp_ie.*, mp_ssdu.*).

	- ETS: Added process of 'Malicious Call Identification (MCID)',
	  'Freephone (FPH)' and 'Completion of Calls to Busy Subscriber (CCBS)'
	  Supplementary Services. Added process of operations specific to
	  supplementary services interactions.
	  - Added compile-time options "NS_SS_MALICIOUS_CALL_ID",
		"NS_SS_FREEPHONE", "NS_SS_CCBS" and "NS_SS_INTERACTIONS".
		(ns_par.h, ns_int.h, ns_ssint.h, ns_ssmac.h, ns_ss.eur, ns_sstab.eur).
	  - simulation :
		- Added building and analyse of new operations for these features
		   (ana_nsss.c, sim_cc1.c).
		- Added new scenario test files SS_FP_MC.S, SS_INTER.S,
		  SS_CCBS1.S and SS_CCBS2.S.
	  - Added new codepoint for notification descriptor
		inside "Notification Indicator" IE (net_ie.ets).

	- AU1+AT9+NI2+E10 : simulation : When building a message to be sent
	  to NS, Channel ID IE is now stored according to the NA type
	  (BRI/PRI) set at configuration time and compile-time parameters
	  "XXX_USE_BRI_SSDU" and "XXX_USE_BRI_SPDU" have been removed.
	  (build_cc.xxx, build_nt.xxx)

	- VN2+VN3+VN6+ ALL networks in USA : net_ie.* : Removed arguments
	  specified after some "#undef" instructions (with "(...)") and
	  also ";" at the end of the file (after "pic_init_ns_xxx_ie ()"
	  function) : it caused compilation errors with some compilers.

	- ETS, NT-side : Fixed a bug : no call context was allocated in the
	  state machine upon receipt of a RESUME message and it caused
	  a Trap (321 = TRAP_STATE_NO_CALL) !  (net_swit.ets)

	- BACKUP :
		- csc_dl_failure_nfas () : Make sure the BACKUP process has been
		  selected before processing a BACKUP specific test. (ns_switc.c)

	- Removed setting of error "ERR_N_NAI" when receiving a message with
	  an unknown NAI : an access to a P_NIL pointer was done when sending
	  MNS_ERR_IN primitive to MNS (no more primitive is sent). (ns_rcv.c)

v6.4 (27 Mar 97)
----------------
	- ETS+VN6 :
		- PRI : Fixed process of Channel ID IE that was not properly
		  processed when it indicated "Any Channel" or "No Channel".
		  (mp_ssdu.*, net_ssdu.*, net_ie.*)

		- NT-side : Fixed a bug : after a broadcast SETUP was sent,
		  2 terminals responded with CONNECT (possibly preceded by
		  other messages), one of them being cleared (the non-selected
		  one), the final clearing phase was not properly processed :
		  if the selected TE sent a DISCONNECT, we considered it as
		  unexpected (STATUS sent). We now process the normal clearing
		  procedure.

	- ETS :
		- Modified code to process correctly repetitions of some IEs
		  (in particular maximum number allowed).
		  (net_spdu.ets, tab_ssdu.ets)

		- Added missing "Transit network Selection" IE inside
		  NS_CONN_RQ and NS_CONN_IN primitives.
		  (tab_ssdu.ets, net_mac.ets)

	- HKT :
		- Modified code so that it is compatible with PIC
		  implementation (Position Independent Code) : Modifications
		  are the same as in ETSI variant (see version v6.0).
		  (pic_nsie.c, pic_ssdu.c, net_ie.*, net_ssdu.*, net_spdu.vn6
		  and new files : tab_ie.*, tab_ssdu.*, mp_ie.*, mp_ssdu.*).

		- Fixed bad process of Channel-ID IE for BRI : the meta-program
		  used the field "p_chan_nb" that was not initialised : it
		  could cause a system crash ! (net_ssdu.ni1)

		- simulation : When building a message to be sent to NS,
		  Channel ID IE is now stored according to the NA type
		  (BRI/PRI) set at configuration time and compile-time
		  parameters "HKT_USE_BRI_SSDU" and "HKT_USE_BRI_SPDU" have
		  been removed.
		  (build_cc.xxx, build_nt.xxx)

	- NI1+NI2:
		- accept an Alert message with no Signal IE (it was mandatory,
		  now optional). (net_spdu.ni1+ni2)

v6.3a (25 Mar 97)
-----------------
	- updated RESET_CONFIG sequences to retransmit a confirmation code
	  (OK/NOK). (mns.c, ns_rcv.c)

	- NS_IE_TSP_IN:

		- After p_buffer_q931 was freed, it was not set to P_NIL.
		  That could have make the stack hit a TRAP (free buffer).

		- Review the deallocation of the p_buffer_q931 buffer process and got
		  rid of the ns_free_tsp_buff variable (useless now).
		  (ns.c, ns.h, ns_proc.c, ns_snd.c, ns_rcv.c)

v6.3 (21 Mar 97)
----------------
	- VN6: TE-side: Fixed bug appeared in v6.1:
	  Added test on country to process a NS_CLEAR_RQ
	  primitive in alerting phase (state U7) : we send a DISCONNECT
	  if country is not FRANCE, else we process as described
	  in v6.1 (net_swit.vn6).

	- Fixed building of MNS_STATUS_IN primitive sent to MNS upon
	  receipt of STATUS when filling the "diagnostic" field : it
	  could use a P_NIL pointer in some cases ! (ns_proc.c)

	- Added some code to initialize common meta-program used for
	  "message_header" pseudo-ie when this IE and PIC implementation
	  are used (MESSAGE_HEADER_IE = ON and OM_CODE_TYPE = OM_PIC).
	  The bug could cause a system crash in this specific case !
	  (pic_ssdu.c)

	- VN2+VN3+DMS+AT5+AT4+AT9+E10+NI1+BIP+QSI+TR6 :
		- Modified code so that it is compatible with PIC implementation
		  (Position Independent Code) : Modifications are the same
		  as in ETSI variant (see version v6.0).
		  (pic_nsie.c, pic_ssdu.c, net_ie.*, net_ssdu.*, net_spdu.vn6
		  and new files : tab_ie.*, tab_ssdu.*, mp_ie.*, mp_ssdu.*).

	- ETS: Added process of 'Explicit Call Transfer (ECT)'
	  Supplementary Service.
	  - Added compile-time option "NS_SS_ECT"
		(ns_par.h, ns_int.h, ns_ssint.h, ns_ssmac.h, ns_ss.eur, ns_sstab.eur).
	  - simulation :
		- Added building and analyse of new operations for
		  explicit call transfer (ana_nsss.c, sim_cc1.c).
		- Added new scenario test file SS_ECT.S.
	  - ETS : Added new codepoints for notification descriptor
		inside "Notification Indicator" IE (net_ie.ets).

	- VN2 :
		- Removed second field for "calling NB" inside structure and
		  description Table used for NS_CONN_IN primitive and removed
		  associated structure "val_ns_calling_nb_u" and Meta-program :
		  it could cause a system crash when receiving a SETUP message
		  containing 2 calling NB. Now both instances of calling number
		  are accepted and correctly processed.
		   (net_mac.vn2, tab_ssdu.vn2, mp_ssdu.vn2)

	- DMS : Fixed a bug upon receipt of a call-related STATUS indicating
	  Null Call State : the call was cleared but access to P_NIL pointer
	  was made after ! (net_swit.dms)

	- AT9 : Fixed a bug inside "AT9_P_CALLED_NB" Meta-program : the
	  description of the "NB Type" field was not correct (use of "D_TABX"
	  together with "TABL" meta-instructions !), it could cause a Trap upon
	  receipt of a Called Number IE. (mp_ssdu.at9)

	- AU1 : Fixed a bug inside "AU1_BC_P" Meta-program : the description
	  of the "Destination Rate" field was not correct (use of "D_TABX" together
	  with "VAL" meta-instructions !), it could cause a Trap upon receipt of a
	  Bearer Capability IE. (mp_ssdu.au1)

	- NI1 : Fixed bad process of Channel-ID IE for PRI : the meta-program used
	  the field "p_chan_nb" that was not initialised : it could cause a system
	  crash ! Now we use the field "chan_nb" for the B Channel Nb is coded on
	  1 octet in PRI. (mp_ssdu.ni1)

	- MAINTENANCE_CAPABILITY + BACKUP :
		Improved recognition of the CC/DL Nai when NS is given a call reference.

	- NI2+DMS+E10 (BRI) :
		Made some changes to pass Bellcore testings.

	- AT5+E10 (BRI, Voice calls) :
		If no origination call appearence has been set in a VOICE outgoing
		setup, set it to 1 by default.

	- AT5 : Added recognition of cause #102 (timer expiry).

	- ETS : Allowed empty UUI (containing 'protocol discriminator'
	  field) received or to be sent. (mp_ie.ets)

	- KDD+NTT+BT2+BV1+SWD+VN2+VN3+BIP+NI1+AT5 : TE-side : ignore NS_CLEAR_RS
	  primitive received in state U19 and do not process it any more as an
	  expected primitive.

	- optimised memory usage for SPDU and SSDU meta-programs (ns_ie.h+ssdu_ml.h)

	- DMS+NI1+NTT : simulation : When building a message to be sent to NS,
	  Channel ID IE is now stored according to the NA type (BRI/PRI)
	  set at configuration time and compile-time parameters
	  "XXX_USE_BRI_SSDU" and "XXX_USE_BRI_SPDU" have been removed.
	  (build_cc.xxx, build_nt.xxx)

v6.2 (06 Mar 97)
----------------
	- VN6+NI2 : Modified code so that it is compatible with PIC
	  implementation (Position Independent Code) : Modifications are
	  the same as in ETSI variant (see below V6.0). (pic_nsie.c,
	  pic_ssdu.c, net_ie.xxx, net_ssdu.xxx, net_spdu.vn6 and new
	  files : tab_ie.xxx, tab_ssdu.xxx, mp_ie.xxx, mp_ssdu.xxx + 1 Macro
	  added in ns.h for PIC).

	- SUPP SERVICES :
		- Modified code so that it is compatible with PIC
		  implementation. (ns_ss.eur, ns_ie_ss.c, pic_nsie.c +
		  new file : ns_sstab.eur)

		- Added process for explicit request of User-to-User
		  Signalling:
		  - Added compile-time parameters "NS_SS_USER_USER_EXP" and
			"NS_SS_MAX_UUS_RQ" (ns_par.h, ns_int.h, ns_ssint.h,
			ns_ssmac.h, ns_ss.eur, ns_sstab.eur).

		  - simulation :
			- Added building and analyse of new operation for UUS
			  Request (ana_nsss.c, sim_cc1.c).
			- Added new scenario test file SS_UUS.S.

	- net_ie.ets : Removed arguments of Macros in some "#undef"
	  instructions to avoid errors with some compilers when PIC
	  implementation is used.

	- ns_proc.c : The ns_free_dl_ctx () routine could have been made a call
	  to Mem_free () with a P_NIL argument. We now check the argument
	  before using the macro (p_nsdl_sav -> p_dl_chan_mgt is the argument).

	- NT-side :
		- Added initialization of 'ces-setup' field inside NS call
		  contexts at configuration time : in some networks, it avoids
		  ignoring the indication of a Data Link connection failure
		  when calls are to be cleared. (bad use of 'Call_ces-setup'
		  in csc_dl_failure_n() function). (ns.c)

		- Modified code so that received STATUS is no more ignored on
		  NT side. (ns_spdu.c)

		- ETS+VN6+NTT+HKT+KDD : Added test on origination entity when
		  processing expiry of timer T322 (used for STATUS ENQUIRY
		  procedure) in state machines : it avoids processing received
		  PROGRESS message as a T322 expiry ! (net_swit.*)

		- ETS+VN6 :
		  - Modified state machine so that received STATUS-ENQUIRY and
		    STATUS messages are processed after a broadcasted outgoing
		    SETUP has been sent.

		  - Modified state machine so that process of some unexpected
		    messages is valid after a broadcasted SETUP : we now send
		    a STATUS with cause #98 or #101.

		  - Modified state machine so that the right Cause IE is
			included in the RELEASE message when a DISCONNECT message
		    has been received with missing cause, erroneous IE or
		    unknown IE. (net_swit.*, net_stat.*).

		  - Modified error handler in order to send a STATUS message
		    upon receipt of a RESUME or a REGISTER message with a call
		    reference in use. (net_err.*)

	- MAINTENANCE_CAPABILITY + BACKUP :

		- When the Backup mode is used, we make sure that the 2 DL
		  contexts (Active+Backup) receive the same information update.
		  This is done thru a new routine : ns_update_bkp_dl_ctx ().

		- ALL :

			Make sure we have the active DL context selected before
			processing the call automaton (net_switch.*)

		- AT4 : Suppressed the code handling the T317 (not described
		  in the 4ESS specification).

	- E10 : When E10_SUPPLEMENTARY_SERVICES was set to ON, we rejected
		a MNS_RESTART_RQ in the circuit_switched_call ().

		- DMS :
			- net_ie.dms : Allowed reception of a channel Id
			  specifying an interface which is not known by NS.
			  This is usefull when using the transparent mode of
			  NFAS. This was already OK for AT4/AT9/E10/NI2.

		- AT9+E10+NI2+DMS :
			- net_swit.* : Avoid confusion between TI_303 and
			DA_MAINT_SERVICE_ACK events (both shares the same
			identifier : '3'). This was already OK for AT4.

	- VN6 : simulation : 'User-Mode' Information Element is included in
	  SETUP and ALERT messages built under simulation to be sent to NS
	  (NT-side) only if NA country is FRANCE : it avoids erroneous SETUP
	  in simulation when country is different from FRANCE. (build_nt.vn6)

	- ETS+VN6 : simulation : Added call to NS interface Macro
	  "Isdn_init_ctx_rq_rs" when building empty NS_STATUS_ENQ_RQ or
	  NS_RESTART_RQ primitive to be sent to NS : it avoids bad data size
	  inside message (build_cc.*).

	- AU1: when using a 'Semi-permanent circuit' call, the
	  BC/Coding-standard field must be coded 'National'. It was not allowed
	  by the basic AU1 standard. (net_ie.au1)

v6.1 (10 Feb 97)
----------------
	- VN6 : TE-side : Removed sending of RELEASE message in alerting
	  phase if it does not contain Network-specific Facility IE
	  (possible for Call Forwarding), UUI IE or User-to-PCS IE.
	  NS_CLEAR_RQ primitive sent after a NS_ALERT_RQ is now ignored.
	  (net_swit.vn6)

	- MAINTENANCE_CAPABILITY :

		- ns_rcv.c : On receipt of a MNS_RESTART_RQ indicating
			RI_SINGLE_INTERFACE, we don't set a channel ID anymore.
			It is needed for versions using the NFAS only.
			The storage of the channel Id is now made in the appropriate
			net_switch.xxx (AT4/AT9/DMS/E10/NI2)

		- ns_proc.c :
			- ns_send_mns_restart () : Updated the interface field when
			maintenance is used.

		- AT4/AT9/DMS/E10/NI2 :

			Corrected receipt of a MNS_RESTART_RQ indicating RI_SINGLE_INTERFACE.
			It caused a TRAP when NS tried to send the RESTART message to
			the line due to the "channel selection" field which was not
			set to "NO_CHAN". Allowed also a channel ID to be sent with
			a restart indicator set to RI_SINGLE_INTERFACE. This impacts the
			net_ie/ssdu/spdu/swit.xxx files.

		- DMS :
			- When NFAS_TSP is used, and when a B channel SERVICE msg was
			received on the Backup D channel, the  MNS_SERVICE_CO indicated
			the wrong interface ID (always Primary link instead of the
			actual one).

			- Added missing recognition of T3_M1 timer event.

			- net_swit.dms :

				Replaced "I_chan_id_a_chan_number" with "I_chan_id_chan_nb" to
				access the B channel number.

		- AT4+AT9+E10 :
			When receiving a B channel SERVICE message with a new B channel
			state, the SERVICE_ACK could have been sent on the NIL call
			reference instead if the GLOBAL one (appeared in 5.25, 8 Jan 97).

	- ns_ssdu3/ns_ie_3.c :

		- Replaced "char" definitions with an "int" because some compilers
		don't assume a "char" is a "signed char" definition. They always do
		with "int".

	- conf_ns.h :

		- Added compilation test upon SIMULATION and SERVICES_INIT to avoid
		  CONST strutures to be defined twice.

	- DMS :

		- Replaced 'ERROR' keyword with OM_ERROR to avoid a compilation
		pb with Borland C++ 5.0 (net_ssdu.dms)

		- TE side : DMS_TAB_SSDU : Avoid a call to a meta program for the
			NS_RESTART_RQ primitive which does contain any IEs.

	- AT9+E10+NI2+DMS (BRI) :
		- Used the XXX_SUPPLEMENTARY_SERVICES (net_par.xxx) to save code.

	- AT4 : (net_mac.at4)

		- Corrected Isdn_at4_store_spf_fac macro. A "Set_to_next_ie_at4" was
		missing at the end of the definition.
		The pb occured only if this macro was not the last of the IE list.

	- AT5/E10 : Voice/Button management :

		- ns_proc.c : Don't reset the call appearance information coming from
			the network when a call is being cleared (call_clear routine).

		- net_stat.at5/e10 :
			If the user did not specify any call appearance in a NS_CONN_RQ,
			and if the network did provide one previously, we now
			directly include it in the SETUP without asking for the permission
			to use it (xxx_button_rq routine).

	- NT2 : ALL NETWORKS : Change wrong 'FG_NT_TE' to 'FG_TE_NT' inside
	  description Tables XXX_TAB_SSDU for all primitives allowed only in
	  Network-to-User direction. This bug has been introduced in version
	  v6.0. (net_ssdu.*)

v6.0 (24 Jan 97)
----------------

	*----------------------------------------------------------------------
	*	NEW BASE VERSION NUMBER : v6.*
	*----------------------------------------------------------------------

	- added support of PIC code (Position-Independent Code).
		  !!! Requires Services version >= v3.54 !!!

	- ETS : Modified code so that it is compatible with PIC
	  implementation (Position Independent Code).
	  - Modified architecture of the files :
		- new files : pic_nsie.c, pic_ssdu.c, pic_nsie.h,
		  pic_ssdu.h, mp_ie.ets, mp_ssdu.ets, tab_ie.ets,
		  tab_spdu.ets, tab_ssdu.ets.
		- net_ie.ets is divided into mp_ie.ets that contains
		  all the IE Meta-programs, tab_ie.ets that contains
		  some Tables and net_ie.ets itself.
		- net_ssdu.ets is divided into mp_ssdu.ets that contains
		  all the SSDU Meta-programs, tab_ssdu.ets that contains
		  some Tables and net_ssdu.ets itself.
		- net_spdu.ets is divided into tab_spdu.ets that contains
		  a Table and net_spdu.ets itself.
	  - Removed all adress of variables inside constants
		(arrays, meta-programs) and changed to P_NIL.
	  - Added functions (pic_init_...) that initialize these
		addresses inside Tables and Meta-programs : they are
		called at initialization time in "ns_var_init ()".
		 (ns.c, ns.h, ns_proc.c, ns_ie.h, ssdu_ml.h,
		  net_ie.ets, net_ssdu.ets, net_spdu.ets).

	- VN6 : Changed value of "VN6_MX_SZ_CHAN_ID" parameter to 30
	  to allow sending of "Channel ID" IE that contains several
	  channel numbers on a PRI access in RESTART and
	  RESTART ACKNOWLEDGE messages (net_par.vn6).

	- VN6 : NT-side : Added missing process of charging information
	  in NS_INFO_RQ primitive to send the correct tax value to the
	  terminal. (net_ssdu.vn6).

	- ETS : Send RELEASE instead of DISCONNECT upon receipt of
	  NS_CLEAR_RQ primitive containing cause #6 "channel unacceptable"
	  as described in §5.3.2 d) of ETS 300-102 corresponding to
	  unsuccessful termiantion of B-channel selection (net_swit.ets).

	- NTT : Removed sending of RELEASE COMPLETE upon receipt of
	  NS_CLEAR_RQ primitive containing cause #19 "User alerted, no answer"
	  as first response to received SETUP (This cause is used for
	  local clearing in case of incompatible address).

	- ns_int.h : Added default value of "NS_SS_DIVERSION" option
	  if it is not defined in ns_par.h (for compatibility).

	- ETS : net_par.ets : Removed some useless tests on compile-time
	  options to avoid compilation warnings.

	- Changed type of global variable "saved_ces" and of "ref_lgth"
	  inside call contexts and added some casts to avoid compilation
	  warnings. (ns.c, ns.h, ns_rcv.c, ns_proc.c, ns_spdu.c,
	  ns_ie_3.c, ns_ssdu3.c, net_ie.ets).

	- A17, HKT, NTT, BT2, TR6, VN2, VN3, VN6, AT4, AT5, AT9, DMS, E10, NI2:
	  when EQUIPMENT is set to NT2, some primitives coming from the upper
	  layer were rejected for FG_NT_NET functional grouping.
		- NS_SUSPEND_RQ: HKT, NTT, ETS, VN6
		- NS_RESUME_RQ : HKT, NTT, ETS
		- NS_HOLD_RQ: A17, AT9, DMS, NI2
		- NS_RET_RS:  A17, AT9, DMS, NI2
		- NS_STATUS_ENQ: TR6
		- NS_SETUP_ACK_RQ: BT2, VN2, VN3, AT5, E10
		- NS_ROUTED_CALL_RQ: VN2, VN3
	  (net_ssdu.*)

*****************************************************************************

v5.25a (13 Jan 97)
------------------
	- ns_int.h: Corrected the SSDU_MAXI definition. It could have been
	  causing memory corruption on TE-side when OPTIMIZATION == SPEED and
	  NS_HOLD_RETRIEVE == OFF. This problem only affects the AT9, DMS,
	  NI1, NI2 and A17 variants.

	- net_switch.ni2 (ni2_ns_ei() routine) : Dl_ei_orig could have
	  been using a NIL pointer (appeared in v5.17, 06 Nov 96).

v5.25 (08 Jan 97)
-----------------
	- Added process of 'Conference call, add-on (CONF)'
	  Supplementary Service.
	  - Added compile-time option "NS_SS_CONFERENCE"
		(ns_par.h, ns_int.h, ns_ssint.h, ns_ssmac.h, ns_ss.eur).
	  - simulation :
		- Added building and analyse of new operations for
		  conference call (ana_nsss.c, sim_cc1.c).
		- Added new scenario test file SS_CONF.S.
	  - ETS : Added new codepoints for notification descriptor
		inside "Notification Indicator" IE (net_ie.ets).

	- ns_par.h : Added some more comments for the AT&T versions
	  (CUSTOM versus NATIONAL).

	- net_ssdu. * : Removed the "\" in the protoype of the check_convert
	  routine. Some compilers did not accept it.

	- net_mac.* : Isdn_xxx_store_llc_V120 : Added a missing "," after the
	  last but one parameter of the Isdn_xxx_store_llc_5_7 macro.

	- Reject only NS_CONN_RQ or NS_RESUME_RQ if the system is congested.
	  (ns_rcv.c)

	- AU1 :

		- Send REL_COMP #17 when the 2 B channels are in use and when
		  we receive an incoming call.

		- Force the sending of the STATUS msg as soon as the error is
		  detected. (Ns_spdu_processed forced to ON)

	- E10 : Added BRI for AT&T 5ESS10 CUSTOM.

	- NI2 : Set timer 303 to 4s on terminal side.

	- USA :

		- net_swit.* : Take into account the interface field in the
		  MNS_RESTART_RQ.

		- net_stat.* : Corrected Active/Backup D channel reseting when
		  receiving a DL_REL_IN in the mb_wait state.

	- NFAS and NS_MAINTENANCE_CAPABILITY :

		- ns_snd.c : ns_snd_cc ().
		  When the TSP mode is used, we now always select the Nai
		  which was elected active at configuration time.

		- In the OOS/OOS state, when a DL_REL_IN is received, try to
		  establish the backup D channel.

		- When recovering a data link connection after a data link failure
			we now send a STATUS_ENQ to check on the state of the remaning
			active calls. (ns_nfas_stop_309 ()).

		- ns_int.h :

			- When NS_MAINTENANCE_CAPABILITY is ON, added an "int_id"
			field in the mns_restart struture.
			This allows to specify a specific interface in a SM_STOP_RQ
			when NFAS is used.

		- ns.h :

			- When NS_MAINTENANCE_CAPABILITY is ON, added a "rest_int_id"
			field in the nsdl structure. It is used on T316 expiry.

	- ALL :

		- Replaced "CLASS" with "OM_CLASS" in the NS code.
		  Some compilers were already using this keyword.

		- When a RESTART is received and when it indicates
		RI_ALL_INTERFACES, NS clears all the relevant call contexts
		internally. It does not need any help from a call control entity.
		If a call control entity still sends 1 NS_RESTART_RQ per call to
		be cleared, this message will be now ignored since the context
		would have already been cleared.

	- SIMULATION :
		- Replaced some "far" with "FAR" (build_nt.kdd/at5).

v5.24 (03 Jan 97)
-----------------
	- ETSI ASN1 facilities:

	a) Added process of 3 operations used for Explicit channel
	  reservation function (SUPPLEMENTARY SERVICES specific).
	  - Added compile-time option "NS_SS_EXPL_CHAN_RESERVATION"
		(ns_par.h, ns_ssint.h, ns_ssmac.h, ns_ss.eur).
	  - simulation :
		- Added building and analyse of these operations.
		  (ana_nsss.c, sim_cc1.c)
		- Added new scenario test file CHAN_RES.S.

	b) Added process of 2 operations used for Three-Party
	  supplementary service (3-way conversation).
	  - Added compile-time option "NS_SS_3_PARTY"
		(ns_par.h, ns_ssint.h, ns_ss.eur).
	  - simulation :
		- Added building and analyse of these operations.
		  (ana_nsss.c, sim_cc1.c)
		- Added new scenario test file SS_3PTY.S.

	- ETS : Added process of Connected-Number and Connected-
	  Subaddress Information Elements inside CONNECT message
	  (and NS_CONN_RS/CO primitives) used for Connected Line
	  Identification Presentation (COLP) and Restriction (COLR)
	  Supplementary Services.
	  - Added compile-time option "NS_COLP_COLR"
	  - Added new scenario test file CONN_NB.S.
	  (ns_par.h, ns_int.h, ns.h, ns_i_s.h, ns_ie_i.h, net_mac.ets,
	  net_ssdu.ets, net_spdu.ets, net_ie.ets, build_cc.ets).

	- Fixed bad process of SUPP SERVICES components received or
	  to be sent that do not contain operation/error specific
	  data (related to argument/result/parameter clause).
	  (ns_ie_ss.c, net_iess.ets).

v5.23 (23 Dec 96)
-----------------
	- Modified all uses of 'Call_...' Macros inside functions and
	  Meta-programs analysing Information Elements in a SPDU for
	  these Macros require a call context that may not have been
	  accessed before (e.g. in the case of a received SETUP) : it
	  could cause a system crash !
	  - ETS+VN6 : 'Call_progress_descr' Macro in analysis of Progress-
		Indicator IE.
	  - AT5 : 'Call_keypad_in_setup' Macro in analysis of Keypad IE.
	  - AU1 : 'Call_chan_id' Macro in analysis of Channel-Id IE.
	  (net_ie.*, net_stat.*)

	- ETS : Implemented transport of components for Supplementary
	  Services using Bearer-independent, connection-oriented
	  transport mechanism (see recommendation ETS 300 196).
	  - process of new call state : Bearer Independent (U31, N31)
		together with new message REGISTER and new primitives
		NS_SPF_REGISTRATION_RQ/IN. (net_mac.ets, net_spdu.ets,
		net_ssdu.ets, net_swit.ets, net_stat.ets)

	- ETS : Implemented process of Hold and Retrieve functions.
	  - Added compile-time option "NS_HOLD_RETRIEVE" (ns_par.h).
	  - Modified code of some primitives and events because
		these codes were used for several different primitives or
		events : NS_HOLD_RQ/IN/RS/CO, NS_RET_RQ/IN/RS/CO, DA_HOLD,
		DA_HOLD_ACK/REJ, DA_RET, DA_RET_ACK/REJ.
	  - Added primitive NS_ABORT_IN and value of its 'cause' field
		'NS_ABORT_CAUSE_CALL_ST_CHG'.
	  - Added 2 timer events : NS_TI_HOLD and NS_TI_RET for expiry of timers
		T-HOLD and T-RETRIEVE and their values in configuration structure
		(at the end of array 'i_ns_call_ti_val' inside ns_config).
		(ns_int.h, ns.h)
	  - Following parameters incremented to take into account these timers :
		NS_MX_CALL_TIMER, NB_CALL_TIMER, ETS_MX_CALL_TIMER, ETS_NB_CALL_TIMER.
		(ns_par.h, ns_int.h, net_par.ets)
	  - Added state machine for Hold and Retrieve functions according to call
		state and new auxiliary call state.
		(ns.h, ns_proc.c, ns_snd.c, net_swit.ets)
	  - Added new codepoints for notification descriptor in Notification Indicator
		IE (2 for Call Hold Supplementary Service, 1 for Call Waiting SS). (net_ie.ets)
	  - simulation :
		- Added building of messages NS_HOLD_RQ/RS, NS_RET_RQ/RS, HOLD,
		HOLD_ACK, HOLD_REJ, RET, RET_ACK, RET_REJ (build_cc.ets, build_nt.ets).
		- Created scenario test file HOLD_RET.S to test Hold and Retrieve functions.

	- Modified 'Set_state' Macro so that proper actions for Hold and Retrieve
	  functions related to any call state transition are taken : call to a
	  network-specific function has been added with Macro 'Ns_call_state_change'.
	  (ns.h, net_fct.* [ALL network variants]).

	- Modified ASN1 Description Meta-programs used for the types in AOC operations
	  so that tagged types are now specified as "implicit", which changes the coding
	  of the Facility IE inside SPDU containing AOC operations that was invalid in
	  some cases (the "IMPLICIT TAGS" specified at the beginning of ASN1 Module
	  "Advice-Of-Charge-Operations" in Recommendation ETS 300 182, section 7.2
	  was not taken into account). (ns_ss.eur)
	  - Modified all scenario test files for AOC to correct the Facility IE content.
		(ss_fac.s, ss_facmg.s, ss_fcext.s, ssfac_in.s)

	- ns_snd.c : Modified call of functions defined in com_proc.c into the
	  use of associated Macros in serv_por.h ("alloc_msg" and "free_buffer").

	- simulation : Added possibility to specify primitives received from
	  Data Link entity with code greater than 128 (defined with "NS_EXT + xxx")
	  by use of special character '<' (simul_nt.c).

v5.22 (06 Dec 96)
-----------------
	- Added checking of primitives permitted with conn ID set to
	  CONN_ID_MANAGEMENT : 3 entries have been added in operator-specific
	  Tables xxx_NET_PROC_PARAM (1 for each possible primitive : NS_INFO_RQ,
	  NS_FAC_RQ, NS_NOTIFY_RQ). If a prohibited primitive is received, we
	  reject it with code 'ERR_U_SSDU_UNEXPECTED' (instead of ignoring it).
	  (net_spdu.*, ns.h, ns_rcv.c)

	- ETS:
	  - Fixed bad evaluation of "type" (Mandatory or Optional) for
		Channel-ID IE upon receipt of ALERT message on TE-side : it
		is mandatory only if the ALERT message sent by network is the
		first response to SETUP. (net_spdu.ets)
	  - Allowed 1 repetition of "Redirecting NB" IE in SETUP.
		(ns_par.h, net_par.ets, net_spdu.ets, net_ssdu.ets)
	  - Modified name of offset for this IE ("ets_redir_nb") inside
		"off_ns_conn_rq" structure to fix "Isdn_ets_store_redir_nb"
		macro that was not valid. (net_mac.ets)
	  - Allowed NOTIFY message with dummy call reference or in any call
		state except 1 and 6 (received or to be sent).
	  - Allowed FACILITY and NOTIFY messages on Broadcast Data Link
		(received in DL_U_DA_IN primitive on TE-side or to be sent in
		DL_U_DA_RQ primitive on NT-side, only with dummy call ref).
		(net_swit.ets, net_stat.ets)
	  - Added rejection of NS_FAC_RQ primitive in state 6.
		(net_swit.ets, net_stat.ets)
	  - Modified error handling so that no STATUS is sent upon receipt of
		an erroneous message with the dummy call ref. (net_err.ets)
	  - simulation: added building of NS_FAC_RQ primitive on NT-side
		(build_cc.ets).

	- Changed bad definition of pointers to function inside
	  "EUROPE_ERROR_TAB" constant Table to avoid compilation warnings.
	  (ns_ss.eur)

	- NFAS processing: ns_rcv.c, ns_establish_dl() routine:
	  When NFAS is used, update the DL context with the DL context
	  which is active.

	- return MNS_SERVICE_CO with error set to I_MANAGEMENT_NOT_SUPPORTED
	  when the application requests a MNS_SERVICE_RQ on a link which was
	  not configured to support it. (ns_rcv.c)

v5.21 (29 Nov 96)
-----------------
	- AU1 :
	  Added process of semi-permanent circuits : 2 values permitted
	  for 'Establishment' field in 'Bearer Capability' IE. NS_CLEAR_RQ
	  primitive rejected on TE-side if call is established and associated
	  with a semi-permanent circuit. The field is now in the BC structure
	  at NS interface.
	  (net_spdu, net_ssdu, net_mac, net_stat, net_swit, ns.h).

	  Removed unused local "p_data" pointer in au1_ie_type_eval().
	  (net_spdu.au1).

	- Fixed process of Supplementary Services specific data:
	  Store_ns_fac_component() macro has been modified to avoid alignment
	  problems with systems using an alignment >= 4. For the same pupose,
	  functions used to analyse the contents of the Facility IE inside
	  a SSDU have been modified.

	  Fixed process of InterrogateServedUserNumbers operation
	  in Facility IE (ns_ssmac.h, ns_ss.eur).

	- VN2 : "User-to-User" IE can now be sent and received in USER_INFO
	  message on interface S and T (indepedent from Functional Grouping).

v5.20 (26 Nov 96)
-----------------
	- Added process of Diversion Supplementary Services : it
	  includes call deflection and call forwarding.

	- ns_par.h : Added compile-time option "NS_SS_DIVERSION".

	- ETS : Added process of "Redirecting NB" and "Redirection NB"
	  IEs. Added "Notification Indicator" IE in many messages.

	- TR6:net_mac : Added structure "off_ns_tr6_te_spf_facility_rq"
	  and redefiniton of Type "off_ns_tr6_spf_facility_rq" :
	  NS_SPF_FACILITY_RQ now contains a Calling NB and no more Display.
	  (it avoids a compilation error in build_c.tr6 under simulation).

	- AT5: fixed bad declaration of 2 constant structures :
	  "AT5_SPDU_PARAM" and "AT5_NET_PROC_PARAM" (they were defined as
	  array instead of structure). It only generates warnings; no execution
	  problem. (net_spdu.at5)

	- A11:net_ie : "SPF_FAC" IE is now defined only if NS_SPF_FACILITY
	  is set to ON in "A11_TAB_IE" Table (It avoids a compilation error
	  if NS_SPF_FACILITY is set to OFF).

	- SIMULATION : Modified printing of Supplementary Services data.

v5.19 (26 Nov 96)
-----------------

	- AT4: corrected some problems after AT4 tests in US labs:

		- ns_snd.c: in send_state():
			- send state 0 in a STATUS on receipt of a bad
			  RESTART and RESTART_ACK, instead of a STATE_REST_xxx state.

			- prevent from sending call state 6 which does not
			  exist in the 4ESS version (send state 0 instead).

		- net_err.at4: send a STATUS#81 when receiving a SETUP on the
		  global call reference.

		- net_stat+net_tim.at4: added 2 optional timers in user side:
		  T303 and T310.

		- net_swit.at4: in case NS_CLEAR_RQ, replaced the state 6 case
		  with a state 0 case.

	- AT4+AT9+E10+DMS: removed the useless xxx_cc_filter() routine.
	  (net_swit.*)

	- AT9+E10+DMS : added missing 'chan_type' field initialization when
	  building a CHAN_ID IE for maintenance message. (net_switc.*)

	- SWD+BV1+KDD+NTT: added missing call to the state u9 function
	  (xxx_u9()) in net_switc.*, leading to a Trap if an NS_CALL_PROC_RQ
	  is sent after NS_CONN_IN.

	- AT4+AT9+E10 (net_stat.xxx):
		- xxx_undef() routines: when calling ns_send_mns_service()
		  routine, the channel Id is meaningless since that routine applies
		  to the whole interface. Its last argument is now set to
		  "no B channel" = 0.

	- AT9+E10 (net_stat.xxx):
		- xxx_custom_osne():
		  On receipt of a SERVICE (In Service) message while in the
		  "out of service near end" state, send back a
		  SERVICE_ACK (In Service) instead of a SERVICE_ACK
		  (Out of service).

	- AT5: net_swit.at5 : on a NS_CLEAR_RQ, a REL was sent instead
	  of a DISC in states 3,4 and 10.

v5.18 (14 Nov 96)
-----------------

	- ns_snd.c:
		- fixed a bug appeared in NS version v5.12:
		  when NS_MAINTENANCE_CAPABILITY is ON and the alignment
		  parameter is 1 (i.e. OM_CPU is INTEL_1 or MOTOROLA_1),
		  then the first byte of the offset area of the NS primitives
		  sent to the user was overwritten. With an alignment greater
		  than 1, the problem did not occur.
		- fixed a bug appeared in NS version v5.14:
		  when NS_MAINTENANCE_CAPABILITY is OFF, then no room was
		  reserved anymore in the NS_CONN_IN primitive for the
		  NS_REDIR_SETUP_IN processing, thus corrupting the
		  NS_REDIR_SETUP_IN.

	- Added some casts to avoid compilation warnings (ns_ie_3.c, ns_spdu.c,
	  ns_ssdu3.c, sim_cc1.c).

	- Modified 'Access_tab_spdu()' macro to avoid useless test (ns.h).

	- 'ns_access_dl_na()' function is implemented on TE-side only: it is
	  replaced by 'ns_access_na()' function on network-side via a new macro
	  'Ns_access_dl_na()' (it avoids a compilation warning). (ns_accss.c)

	- Simulation: Supplementary Services Facility IE analysis:
		- when the simulation flag '9' was used (full ASN1 facility
		  analysis), the offset area of the NS-interface primitives
		  was destroyed.
		- added full ASN1 analysis for NS_..._RQ and NS_..._RS primitives.
		  (ana_nsss.c, ana_ns_1.c)

	- m23.mak: added linker option to generate a detailed map file.

v5.17 (06 Nov 96)
-----------------

	- NI2: made corrections to pass Bellcore lab testing.
	  (net_switc, net_stat, net_spdu, net_err.ni2)

v5.16 (05 Nov 96)
-----------------

	- DMS: made corrections to pass Bellcore lab testing.
	  (net_ie, net_ssdu, net_err.dms)

	- AT4: corrected SPF_FAC IE. (net_ie, net_ssdu, net_swit.at4)

	- ns.h: added "ei_orig" field in the 'nsdl' structure. That allows
	  to know who (TE or network) initiated the SPID negotiation.

	- corrected P_NIL access problem appeared in v5.12. (ns_proc.c)

v5.15 (31 Oct 96)
-----------------
	- ns_par.h : Added compile-time parameters "NS_SS_MAX_AOC_CHARGING_RQ",
	  "NS_SS_MAX_CUG".

	- ns_proc.c :

		- Modified spdu_call_ref_load () and  i_call_ref_load ()
		 routines. A bug has been introduced in V5.12.
		 An outgoing SETUP could have been sent on global call reference.

		- Added a test on D channel backup in ns_get_ctx_d_chan_bearer ().

		- Renamed global variable 'net_idx' to 'ns_net_idx' to prevent
		  bad reset of global net_idx inside dec_net_idx() function for
		  RESET CONFIGURATION.

	- net_spdu.* : Added 2 parameters in the spdu_param table.
		- d_channel 	: D channel slot number
		- mx_b_channel	: maximum B channel supported.

	- net_fct.e10, ni2 : Added 2 missing prototypes when NEW_FCT_STYLE is OFF.

	- net_swit.dms : Added a missing test when looking at the
	  B channel state (PRI type only).

	- ns_nssmac.h : Removed a cast on the left side
	  (Isdn_get_ss_first_component).

	- ns.c : Removed a cast on the left side (Dl_p_chan_mgt).

	- SUPP SERVICES: added process of multiple instances of the same
	  operation or error inside Facility component. Modified name of some
	  interface Macros and structures. Modified offsets in SS components:
	  they are now computed from start of current component and coded on 2
	  octets (ushort). Added fields "component_nb" and "size" inside
	  Facility IE.
	  (ns_ss_int.h, ns_ssmac.h, ns_ie_ss.c, net_iess.ets, ns_ss.eur)

	- s3.c : Added function 'build_sdu_sm_to_mns' to be able to simulate
	  messages from SM to MNS (to test restart and reset configuration
	  procedures).

v5.14 (24 Oct 96)
-----------------
	- implemented process of FACILITY IE for Supplementary-Services in
	  EUROPE and 'Advice of Charge' and 'Closed user Group' S-S:
		- ASN1 library is to be used : asn1_enc.c, asn1_dec.c,
		  asn1_prc.c, ber_enc.c, ber_dec.c.
		- new files : ns_ie_ss.c, ana_nsss.c, ns_ssint.h included in
		  ns_int.h, ns_ssmac.h included in ns_mac.h, net_iess.ets,
		  ns_ss.eur, asn1_par.h.
		- ns_par.h : Added compile-time options "NS_SUPP_SERVICES",
		  "NS_SS_AOC_S", "NS_SS_AOC_D", "NS_SS_AOC_E", "NS_SS_CUG".
		- ns.h : Added new TRAP code.
		- ns_rcv.c : Accept NS_FAC_RQ primitive with
		  'CONN_ID_MANAGEMENT'conn ID (dummy call ref).
		- ETS: net_spdu, net_ssdu, net_ie, net_mac : Added FACILITY IE
		  in many messages and modified IE analysis. Added
		  Called-Nb/Sub-address IEs in NS_FAC_IN/RQ primitives.
		  Accept dummy call ref.
		  Added EXTENDED FACILITY IE inside SPDUs which is turned into
		  a FACILITY IE at NS interface.
		- ETS:net_swit, net_stat : Modified state machine to accept
		  Facility Message independently from call state. Received
		  Facility SPDU is sent to user using NS_FAC_IN primitive,
		  NS_FAC_RQ primitive is expected to send Facility SPDU.
		- s3.c : Added simulation flag "ns_pr_sdu_ss" to enable
		  decoding of SUPP SERVICES data.
		- ana_ns_1.c : Added specific decoding for SUPP SERVICES data
		  inside SSDU.
		- sim_cc*.c, build_cc.ets : Added building of SS data inside
		  Facility IE.
		  Facility IE content consists of 1 or more component(s)
		  described in ns_ssint.h file.
		  Macros to store and read IE content are provided in
		  ns_ssmac.h file.

	- ns.c : Corrected computation of the size of "nfas_tab".

	- ns_proc.c : Force PRI call reference length to 2 only when supported
	  by the network (TR6 does not support a PRI call reference length of 2).

	- ns_rcv.c : When D/B maintenance is not supported, answer a
	  MNS_SERVICE_CO with error I_MAINTENANCE_NOT_SUPPORTED to
	  a MNS_SERVICE_RQ.

	- AT4+AT9+E10+NI2+DMS :
		- Corrected compilation errors when NS_MAINTENANCE_CAPABILITY or
		  when NS_D_BACKUP was set to OFF.

	- BT2+NI1+NI2+AT4 : net_err.* : Added missing process of an
	  out-of-sequence IE that could cause a Trap.

	- A11+NI1+BIP+NI1+NI2+VN6 : ie_type_eval () routine :
		- Made optional the Channel Id in a RESTART_ACK (instead of CD).

	- AT9+E10 : Corrected restart procedures on T316 expiry (when
	  NS_MAINTENANCE_CAPABILITY is used).

	- AT4 : Corrections due to tests against an AT&T tester.

	- DMS : Added a diagnostic in the response to the network when an
		unexpected event occures.

	- TR6: fixed interface problem with SPF_FAC IE. (net_ssdu.tr6)

	- NT-side : Added timer TI_DL_EST to prevent an "infinite" loop between
	  DL and NS (DL_EST_RQ, DL_REL_IN) when a NA is disconnected (or a DL
	  connection fails) and Timer 309 is used. Now DL establishment is
	  requested only every few seconds if the connection fails while a call
	  is active.

v5.13 (14 Oct 96)
-----------------
	- NI2: added missing UUI Information Element in the interface.
	  (net_ssdu.ni2, net_mac.ni2)

v5.12 (03 Oct 96)
-----------------

	- ns_par.h :
		- Added NS_D_BACKUP statement (ON/OFF).
		  Default value is OFF.
		  Used to declare a D channel backup for North American PRI variants.
		- added NS_MX_NFAS_NAI parameter.
		- added NS_MX_NFAS_GROUPS parameter.

	!!! Requires Services version >= v3.50 for D/B channel management support.
	!!! (i.e. if NS_MAINTENANCE_CAPABILITY is ON)

	- kernel :

		- Made possible the use of an "ushort" defined conn_id_t.
		  This will be needed for applications using NS for PRI
		  and Transparent NFAS.
		  By defining add_t with ushort, they may have more than
		  255 calls on the same Nai.

		- Avoided a memory leak when NS_IE_TSP_IN was used.
		  When NS received a SPDU from DL which was not sent
		  to CC, the second buffer was thus useless and not
		  released. Added a flag to free that buffer when the
		  SPDU is not to be sent to CC.

		- Added NFAS and D channel backup support (PRI, US variants : AT4,
		  AT9, E10, DMS, NI2).

		- Added B channel management support (PRI, US variants only).

	- ns_proc.c :

		- Added ns_free_dl_ctx () routine. If frees the DL objects in
		  the nsna object.

		- Corrected internal call ref computation for PRI. There was a
		  bug when the switch sent a call ref length of 1 and then of
		  2 for the same call.

	- ns_ssdu3.c : transparent mode: reset the transparent offset area to 0
	  when sending a primitive to NS instead of just skipping it.

	- ns.h
		- struct nsdl :
			- Added "button" management for AT5 voice calls.
			- Modify D/B channels management structure fo PRI.

		- corrected Error_level_eval() macro.

		- corrected compiler warning due to lack of definition of some
		  AT5-related compile-time parameters when compiling non-AT5 operators.

	- net_fct.* : added 2 new entries in the XXX_UCHAR_FCT_2P_TAB table
	  for D/B channels management :
		- Put_fct (F_UCHAR_2P_FILTER,			xxx),
		- Put_fct (F_UCHAR_2P_BKP_MAINT_PROC,	xxx),

	- net_spdu.* : added a NFAS support parameter in the
	  net_proc_param structure.

	- AT5 :

		- Added the management for "buttons" with AT5.
		  When NS receives a voice call, it now makes sure the
		  "button" (call appearance) which is specified in the
		  NS_CONN_RQ, is available on the network by sending an INFO
		  message to the line. The sending of the SETUP is postponed
		  until we receive the confirmation from the network.
		  If nothing is received before T300 expiry, we internally
		  clear the call with cause #21 (call rejected).
		  If call appearance 0 is specified, then the SETUP is
		  sent without making sure of the button availability.
		  The call appearance which will be sent will be the
		  last one specified by the network. If the network
		  did not previously specify a call appearance, we'll
		  send a value of 1 for the call appearance.

		- Added the management of the "GET" MAN_INFO message
		  coming from the line.

	- simul_nt.c :

		- Added simulation for Maintenance protocol discriminators
		  (0x03 or 0x43) for PRI US variants.

		- build_pdu_ns () routine: build the multiwork table
		  for both TE and NT2 options. (was done for NT2 only).

	- simul_n2.c :

		- mg_call_ref () routine : Made possible the gathering of
		  a call ref containing more than 3 digits.

v5.11 (25 Sep 96)
-----------------

	- ETS+VN6: ETS-300-102-1, Table 9.2, Note 4: T310 must not be started
	  if progress indicator #1 or #2 (i.e. interworking with non-ISDN network
	  occured) has previously been received).
	  It was started unconditionally, leading to call clearation after 45
	  seconds when calling some non-ISDN number where the Connect message
	  would not come in before a few minutes (e.g. tax-free numbers).
	  (net_ie.*, net_stat.*).

	- VN6: allowed to send multiple Calling_nb IEs in NS_CONN_RQ.

	- simulation: allowed to specify a network operator id valid for all
	  NAIs on the command line by setting the NAI to '*'.
	  Example: "n=*ets" will set all configuration NAIs to ETS.
	  (get_simul_net_op() in ana_ns_1.c).

	- VN6, BV1, AT4, AT9, E10, NI2:
	  fixed processing of 'Redirected_nb' IE in Setup and NS_CONN_RQ/IN.

v5.10 (11 Sep 96)
-----------------
	- ETS+VN6: allowed any IA5 character in the Keypad IE (only extended
	  digits where allowed) (net_ssdu.ets+vn6)

	- NTT: corrected coding of channel-id IE in PRI interface. The channel
	  number was followed by an unexpected 0x80 octet. (net_ssdu.ntt)

	- DMS: fixed a random access occuring when a call clearing request
	  (NS_CLEAR_RQ) is sent right after a call establishment request
	  (NS_CONN_RQ) and the DL connection is not established. (net_swit.dms)

v5.9 (24 Jul 96)
----------------
	- ns_spdu.c: added processing of CONDITIONAL Type for single-octet
	  IEs when receiving an SPDU.

	- If more than one message were received from CC before the DL connection
	  is established, then they were not processed in the proper
	  order. All messages received from CC are now put in the CC queue if
	  the DL connection is not established.
	  (ns_rcv.c, ns_switc.c)

	- ns_int.c: fixed a bug occuring only if 'ns_offset_t' typedef is not
	  uchar (i.e. ushort or ulong): the address where to store the SSDU
	  offset values was not computed properly.

	- NT-side:
		- corrected processing of STATUS: the received 'ces' value is stored
		  into the call context if the call reference is associated to a
		  call in a non-null state (the storage was done when no call
		  context was accessed, which caused a Null pointer access).
		  (ns_spdu.c)
		- corrected processing of a Data Link Failure (receipt of DL_REL_IN)
		  in case of a call initiated on the Broadcast Link Connection (in
		  point-to-multipoint configuration), in order to take into account
		  all terminals that may have responded to the call.
		  (ns_switc.c)

		- ETS+VN6: (net_stat.*)
			- added stop of T301 in state n7 upon receipt of a CONNECT
			  SPDU in point-to-multipoint configuration (T301 was stopped in
			  other cases but in this case it caused the call to be cleared
			  upon T301 expiry if an ALERT had been received).
			- added processing of T309 expiry in state n10 (caused a Trap).
			- added processing in n0i() (individual process) of unexpected
			  SPDUs received from a terminal in the Null state for an
			  outgoing call (when SETUP was broadcast).

	- ETS+VN6:
		- changed process of Cause Diagnostic so that it can contain any
		  octet. (net_ssdu.*)
		- added sending of Diagnostic for causes #29, #50, #69
		  (Facility related). (net_ie.*)
		- corrected searching of error code in the Error Handler so that the
		  error due to the Global-Call-Ref is the first one to be processed
		  (bug introduced in version v5.7 when implementing error priorities).
		  It prevents from sending a RELEASE COMPLETE instead of a STATUS
		  with the Global-Call-Ref.
		  (net_err.*)

v5.8 (18 Jul 96)
----------------
	!!! Requires Services version >= v3.46 for AT4 support !!!

	- Added AT&T 4ESS support.
	  This version is based on the AT&T TR-41459 August 1995.

	- ns_par.h : Added F_AT4 flag (ON/OFF).

	- AT4:
		- added *.at4 files in USA sub-directory
		- added cc_at4.c

	- ns_proc.c : Improved ns_b_channel_maintenance () routine.

	- ETS+VN6, NT-side:
		- in the NS_CLEAR_IN and NS_CLEAR_CO messages sent after T303 and
		T312 expiries, send the clearing cause value received in the REL_COMP
		messages if any, so that the application knows the clearing cause.
		The cause value was not sent (no cause).
		(net_state.*, net_switc.*)

v5.7 (08 Jul 96)
----------------
	- corrected processing of multiple IE errors in one message. The error
	  priorities were not taken into account, sometimes leading to erronous
	  cause values in the sent-back STATUS message.
	  (ns_err.c, ns.c, ns_proc.c, ns.h)

v5.6 (26 Jun 96)
----------------
	- ETS+VN6: accept 'Advice of Charge' IE in codeset 5 regardless to the
	  country code. It was only processed for Belgium country code.
	  (ns_spdu.ets/vn6)

	- ALL NETWORKS:
	  accept to send calling_nb IE with no digit. It was already accepted in
	  messages coming from the line interface (DL). This helps for the CLIR
	  facility. (net_ssdu.*)

v5.5 (21 Jun 96)
----------------
	- NT-side: (AU1, HKT, KDD, AT5, DMS)
		- Added state machines for network side.
		- Changed SSDU primitives and interface structures for symmetry
		  purpose (same SSDUs for TE and NT sides).
		  (net_stat, net_swit, net_ssdu, net_mac.*)

	- Corrected r_ssdu () function so that the implicit values be loaded into
	  internal structures only if the IE is present in the SSDU or marked 
	  as MI in the Model Tables (no external representation). (ns_ssdu3.c)

	- Changed bad Call ref flag in MAINT_SERVICE_ACK maintenance
	  message sent upon receipt of MAINT_SERVICE (used when
	  NS_MAINTENANCE_CAPABILITY parameter is set to ON). (ns_rcv.c)

	- ETS+VN6 : Added process of 'Advice of Charge' IE in codeset 5 used in
	  Belgium and also in codeset 6 for VN6. This IE belongs to codeset 5
	  (Belgium) or codeset 6 (other countries) but in both cases it has the
	  same identifier and content. The i_advice_charge structure is used for
	  both IEs (added for VN6 in ns_i_s.h and ns_ie_i.h).
	  (net_par, net_mac, net_ie, net_spdu, net_ssdu)

	- ETS: Corrected process of 'Advice of Charge' IE. (net_ie, net_ssdu)

	- VN6: (net_stat.vn6)
		- Changed bad ETS_T305 index into VN6_T305 in vn6_n7 () function,
		- Changed bad 'Ets_send_to_all_ces' into 'Vn6_send_to_all_ces' Macro.

	- QSI:
		- Removed 2 erroneous entries in QSI_TABLE_ERROR after
		  "ERR_N_STATUS_CALL_REF" entry (the evaluation of error severity level
		  [FATAL/NON-FATAL/IGNORED] was possibly wrong for all errors located
		  after this one in the Table !). (net_err.qsi)
		- Added missing 'facility' and 'notify indicator' IEs
		  in PROGRESS SPDU. (net_spdu.qsi)

	- A11+A17: Corrected erroneous 'Isdn_a1*_store_credit_card_nb' Macros
		  and (A11 only) 'Isdn_a11_store_aircraft_info' Macro. (net_mac.*)

	- NI2+E10+DMS: Corrected erroneous 'Isdn_*_store_spf_fac' macros, causing
	  compilation errors due to previous changes in ns_mac.h. (net_mac.*)

	- DMS:
		- Added a missing 'break' statement in dms_ie_type_eval().
		  This caused a CAUSE IE in a REL or REL_COMP to be treated as an
		  excluded IE. (net_spdu.dms)
		- Changed 'df_ssdu_dms_i_signal' constant structure to avoid Trap
		  event when 'Signal' parameter is not provided by upper entity in the
		  NS_ALERT_RQ primitive (mandatory on NT-side for BRI access).
		  (net_ie.dms)

v5.4 (05 Jun 96)
----------------
	- TE-side, all networks: (net_switc.*): added processing of NS_CLEAR_RQ
	  in state u12 (STATE_DISCONNECT_INDICATION_12): send a RELease message
	  to the network, and go to state u19.
	  This problem was occuring only if the application sends an NS_CLEAR_RQ
	  instead of NS_CLEAR_RS in that state, or in case of a clearing
	  collision (receipt of a DISConnect message when the application sends
	  an NS_CLEAR_RQ).

	- NTT: modified channel-id IE to allow MAP-coding.

v5.3 (23 May 96)
----------------
	- ns_accss.c : Added test on SPDU ID in ns_access_call_ref () function
	  to avoid wrong storage of Call CES if RELEASE or RELEASE COMPLETE
	  is the first message received on a CES in response to a SETUP (It
	  enables a valid count of the calls on a DL connection).

	- NT-side:ETS+VN6: net_stat.*: 
	  - Added receipt of NS_CLEAR_RS primitive
	  in states n12 and n22 that was processed as an unexpected event
	  (NS_ERR_IN was sent). 
	  - Added missing process of Timer T301 expiry after 
	  receiving an ALERTING message (call state n7 : clearing procedure
	  is initiated).
	  - NS_SUSPEND_CO is sent to upper entity instead of NS_SUSPEND_IN
	  upon receipt of Suspend in state n10, NS_SUSPEND_RS primitive
	  is expected instead of NS_SUSPEND_RQ afterwards (state n15).
	  - NS_RESUME_CO is sent to upper entity instead of NS_RESUME_IN upon
	  receipt of Resume in state n0, NS_RESUME_RS primitive is expected
	  instead of NS_RESUME_RQ afterwards (state n17).
	  - Added (VN6 only) start of Timer T301 upon receipt of ALERTING 
	  message in state n6.

	- VN6:net_ie.vn6: Added code 'OVERLAP_SENDING' (= 5) in 'Numbering type'
	  field in 'Called Nb' IE that was valid but not accepted (this type
	  may be sent in overlap sending mode by VN2/VN3 equipments).

v5.2 (10 May 96)
----------------
	- ns_int.h : Added structure 'mns_restart' used to specify Restart Class
	  and possible B-Channel Nb in SM_STOP_RQ primitive (-> MNS_RESTART_RQ)
	  for outgoing restart procedure.

	- ns.h, ns_proc.c : Fixed backup of cause diagnostic to send the
	  same cause as the one previously sent with the right diagnostic
	  (it could cause a trap).

	- ns_spdu.c : Improved process of multiple instances of an IE.
	  Added missing initialization of 'bc_teleservice_compatibility' variable.
	  Added missing test on direction in model (u -> n, n -> u) for Single-octet IEs.

	- ns.h, ns_rcv.c,
	  ALL NETWORKS except BT2+TR6+VN2+AT5 :net_swit.*, net_tim.* :
	  Added corresponding process of Restart Class and B-Channel Nb.
	  Corrected process of received STATUS with call ref global (checking of
	  Call State IE value compatibility was not valid).

	- ns_proc.c : Changed Call State IE value in STATUS to send upon receipt
	  of an unexpected RESTART or RESTART_ACK message on call ref global :
	  the value is the global interface state (REST_0/1/2).

	- net_ie.*: Added 2 missing values in table of Call state values used in
	  restart procedures (in STATUS message) : STATE_REST_1, STATE_REST_2.

	- net_ssdu.*: Added NS_RESTART_RQ/RS/IN messages on NT-side.

	- A11:net_stat.a11: Changed invalid index A17_T305 into A11_T305.

	- VN6:net_spdu.vn6: Added RESTART message authorized in u -> n direction
	  and RESTART_ACK message in n -> u direction.

	- VN2:net_spdu.vn2: Removed RESTART and RESTART_ACK message descriptions
	  undefined in the specification.

	- TR6:net_spdu.tr6: the PRI call-ref length is 1 instead of 2.

	- SIMULATION:
		- sim_cc1.c : Added 'build_sdu_sm_to_mns' function to build messages
		  dynamically from SM to MNS under simulation (SM_STOP_RQ,
		  SM_SET_CONFIG_RQ and SM_RESET_CONFIG_RQ).

		- ETS+VN6:build_cc.*: Added test on NA type (BRI/PRI) under simulation
		  to code Channel-ID IE (it was always coded as for BRI) and simulation
		  to NS_RESTART_RQ message on NT-side. Added test on functional grouping
		  to build the same messages in NT-to-NET direction as on TE-side.

v5.1 (18 Apr 96)
----------------
	- ns_proc.c: allowed to set the country code to 'BELGIUM' when the
	  operator-code is set to 'FT_VN6'.

	- ns.h: modified the 'Vl_ie_id' and 'Vl_ie_length' macros to avoid
	  problems with Intel's Medium model.

	- ana_ns_1.c (simulation only): modified 'get_simul_net_op()' so that
	  the 'country-code' fields of the configuration structures are not
	  modified if there is no 'n=...' string on the command line.

v5.0 (05 Apr 96)
----------------

	*----------------------------------------------------------------------
	*	NEW BASE VERSION NUMBER : v5.*
	*----------------------------------------------------------------------
	*
	*	ANY MODULE THAT USES NS interface Macros
	*	SHOULD USE only once "Isdn_ctx" Macro and INCLUDE FOLLOWING DEFINES
	*	before using the Macros :
	*
	*		#define	ns_int_ctx		ns_int_ctx_???
	*
	*	where ??? is a string that represents the entity name,
	*	e.g. 'app' for an application entity.
	*
	*	The Omnitel's CC entity defines 'ns_int_ctx_cc'
	*
	*----------------------------------------------------------------------

	- ns_int.c, ns_mac.h :
		Changed ns_int_init_ctx_rq_rs () and ns_int_set_offset ()
		parameters. Transparent for the NS-user.
		This is to allow more than one Call-Control entity to use those
		functions without conflict.

	- net_mac.* (all networks): redefined Isdn_init_*_ctx_rq_rs() macro
	  to use the 'ns_int_init_ctx_rq_rs() function defined in ns_int.c to
	  reduce code size.

	- AU1: corrections due to KTL-lab PRI approval tests.

	- NT-side (ETS+VN6):
		- net_swit.*, net_stat.*:
		  corrected Network-side state machine to send NS_CLEAR_IN instead
		  of NS_CLEAR_CO to upper entity each time the call is not cleared,
		  to send NS_CLEAR_CO upon T312 expiry in state CALL_ABORT_22 and
		  to clear the call upon T300 expiry in state CALL_INIT_1. Corrected
		  call state after receipt of PROGRESS or INFO message and CALL STATE
		  IE sent in STATUS message (same messages or DISCONNECT received).
		  Added missing start T300 upon receipt of SETUP message in ETSI.

		- net_spdu.*: the 'Channel-id' IE is optional in CALL_PROC and
		  ALERT messages when received on NT-side.

	- TE-side: ETS+VN3+VN6: in order to be compatible with more switches,
	  do not send 'Conn-Ack' upon receipt of 'Connect'. Some switches were
	  sending back a Status message (cause #98 'message not implemented or 
	  incompatible with call state').

	- AT9:net_swit.at9: Corrected Endpoint-Id process, handled only when
	  Basic Rate Interface is compiled (instead of PRI interface).

	- ALL NETWORKS except AT5+AT9+NI1+NI2+DMS (net_swit, net_fct): removed
	  prototype of undefined function xxx_ns_ei ().

*****************************************************************************

v4.53 (28 Mar 96)
-----------------
	- NT-side:
		- fixed DL Call count : number of calls in progress on a DL connection
		  was not correct (ns_proc.c + ETS+VN6 state machine).
		- ns_proc.c: added missing access to the DL context in call_init()
		  function (could cause a system crash).
		- VN6 : (net_swit, net_stat) :
		  corrected Network-side state machine to send indication to upper
		  entity when required, to change call state of global process,
		  to process correctly SETUP_ACK and CALL PROC received before
		  ALERT. Changed NS_CONN_IN to NS_CONN_CO upon receipt of CONNECT.
		  Modified vn6_send_to_other_ces to send RELEASE and INFO messages
		  to other terminals.
		- ETS+VN6 : (net_swit, net_stat) :
		  corrected Network-side state machine upon receipt of a first response
		  to broadcast SETUP (i.e. CALL PROC/SETUP ACK/ALERT/CONNECT) if call
		  is in state 8 or 22 (due to response(s) of another terminal).

	- ns.c: removed initialisation of a pointer that was not used in TE.

	- AT9+DMS+NI2: Removed rejection of ISDN Called-Nb with less than 7 digits.

	- VN6:net_ie.vn6: fixed coding of USER-MODE IE in transparent mode in a SPDU.

	- VN3:build_cc.vn3: fixed bad number of arguments in Isdn_vn3_store_bc() macro.

	- AU1: TE side: start timer T305 when sending a Disconnect message.

	- ana_ns_1.c : Added missing entries in Timer Tables to display in test files.

v4.52 (15 Mar 96)
-----------------
	- kernel : fixed call-state value sent in a STATUS message.

	- ns_spdu.c, ns_ssdu3.c : Improved process of single-octet IEs
	  to prevent bad number of instances of the IE in the SSDU and to manage
	  single-octet IEs belonging to codeset different from codeset 0.

	- ALL NETWORKS : net_spdu.xxx : added codeset field in all
	  single-octet IE descriptions.

	- ns_switc.c : stop timer T3_DL_EST if running when DL connection is reset.

	- ETS+VN6+A17+NTT+AT9+E10+NI2 : corrected NT-side state machine to manage
	  T300 time-out event in state n11 and to ignore NS_CLEAR_RS event
	  in state n19.

	- idem + A11 : corrected NT-side state machine to report NS_CLEAR_CO to
	  the user after NS_CLEAR_RQ in state 1.

	- VN6 : send RELEASE instead of DISCONNECT in state 7 upon receipt
	  of NS_CLEAR_RQ on TE-side. Removed sending of STATUS message
	  in case of erroneous optional IE.

	- AT9 : removed diagnostic in STATUS sent upon receipt of an unknown
	  message.

	- ns_snd.c: corrected compilation problem if NS_SEGMENTATION is ON
	  (appeared in NS version v4.51).

	- VN2: fixed compilation problem under simulation on NT-side.

	- E10: net_mac.e10: changed Isdn_e10_store_traveling_classmark_tsp()
	  macro name into Isdn_e10_store_travel_classmark_tsp() to avoid too long
	  identifiers. Same with Isdn_e10_store_user_entered_code_tsp(), changed
	  into Isdn_e10_store_user_entered_tsp().

-----------------
	- ns_snd.c, ns.h, net_err.* : modified to be able to send NS_ERR_IN to
	  any user entity, not only to ENT_CC.

-----------------
	- ETS : Internal change.

	  initialization in net_ie.ni2.

	- net_mac.*: Added dummy 'val_ns' structure declaration for
	  'sending_complete' and 'more_data' IE to avoid compilation pb at CC

			-------------------+----------------------------
				Euro-ISDN      |   EUROPE
				Euro-Numeris   |   EUROPE or FRANCE
				VN2/VN3        |             FRANCE

	- VN3:
		modified Cause IE processing to accept diagnostic field,
		modified Called_nb IE processing to accept any 'type' or 'plan' value,
		modified processing of invalid or incompatible BC or HLC IE to send
		back a REL_COMP with Cause #88.
