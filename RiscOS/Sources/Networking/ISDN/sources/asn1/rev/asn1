#if 0

v1.6 (11 Jul 97)
----------------
	- Added process of ASN1 type "ANY". No encoding or decoding is made
	  and data is passed transparently from or to ASN1 Module.
	  (asn1_prc.c, asn1_enc.c, asn1_dec.c, ber_enc.c, ber_dec.c,
	   asn1.h, asn1_ber.h, asn1_par.ns, asn1_par.lmi)

	- Fixed a bug that occurred when decoding a type whose length was of
	  indefinite form in some cases : the End-of-Content octets were not
	  taken into account if the type was included in another type (as SET,
	  SEQUENCE, SET OF, SEQUENCE OF) (ber_dec.c).

v1.5 (20 May 97)
----------------
	- Fixed a bug in ASN1 decoding : the "End-Of-Content" octets were not
	  skipped when length was of indefinite form while decoding a tagged
	  type described with an ASN1 meta-program that contains 1 "type field"
	  that refers to another ASN1 meta-program (corresponding to a type
	  defined with explicit tagging in recommendation). Added 1 error code
	  for this case. (asn1_int.h, asn1_dec.c)

	- Added compile-time options defining use of some ASN1 Types
	  to avoid unused code.
	  (asn1_par.ns, asn1_par.lmi, asn1_int.h, asn1_enc.c, asn1_dec.c)

	- Removed function and replaced Macro used for ObjectDescriptor Type
	  (process is unchanged) to avoid unused code.
	  (asn1.h, asn1_ber.h, ber_enc.c)

v1.4 (28 Apr 97)
----------------
	- Added new encoding/decoding mode for OBJECT IDENTIFIER type.
	  The sub-identifiers that are appended at the end of the value can be
	  provided (to/from ASN1 Module) using a string (via "address" field
	  of storage context) that will simply be copied ("coding_flag" field
	  of storage context must be set to the new value
	  ASN1_FLAG_OBJ_ID_APPEND_STR, else each octet of the string
	  is processed as a separate sub-identifier, as in previous version).
	  (asn1_int.h, ber_enc.c, ber_dec.c)

	- Added missing test on user-provided pointer to object identifier tree
	  before encoding or decoding an OBJECT IDENTIFIER value : it could
	  cause a Trap or a system crash when no tree is defined (no OBJECT
	  IDENTIFIER used) and a value is received. (ber_enc.c, ber_dec.c)

	- Fixed a bug that could cause wrong decoding of a basic type if its
	  encoding was "constructed" (possible in some cases). (asn1_dec.c)

	- Fixed bad encoding of each sub-identifier OBJECT IDENTIFIER : 
	  Bit 8 of each octet in sub-identifier was not correctly set.
	  (ber_enc.c)

v1.3a (09 Jan 97)
-----------------
	- asn1_par.h: added missing end of comment

v1.3 (29 Nov 96)
----------------
	- PARAMETERS:
	  modified asn1_par.h to allow only 2 parameters, to select between
	  ASN1 code customized for use with ISDN-BRICKS NS entity, or for
	  use with ATM-BRICKS ILMI entity.

	- Added 2 files: asn1_par.ns and asn1_par.ilm (must not be edited).

	- asn1_dec.c : Added re-initialization of current internal length upon
	increase of internal imbrication level to avoid bad decoding in some
	cases. Corrected decoding of SEQUENCE or SET types : we now test if
	end of SEQUENCE (or SET) is reached after each imbricated type is
	processed; it avoids processing remaining imbricated types if they
	are optional and absent in data. 

	- asn1_enc.c : Added 1 cast to avoid compilation warning.

v1.2 (24 Oct 96)
----------------
	- asn1_enc.c : Fixed encoding of basic type so that the encoding is
	constructed if required (if basic type is tagged and IMPLICIT keyword
	is not used in ASN1 description Meta-program for the Type).
	Added re-initialization of current internal length to avoid encoding
	of a wrong length in some cases.
	BOOLEAN values are now passed using "size" field of storage contexts
	instead of "address" field.

v1.1 (09 Sep 96)
----------------
	- Added process of OPTIONAL keyword in ASN1 types (description of types
	marked OPTIONAL in ASN1 meta-programs and process of presence of values)
	-> new compile-time option : ASN1_OPTIONAL_USED.

	- asn1_dec.c : Modified function "asn1_decode_basic_type()" to be able
	to decode basic types (No type field in corresponding ASN1 meta-program)
	with constructed encoding (possible when type is tagged without IMPLICIT
	keyword).

	- ber_dec.c : Modified function "ber_decode_object_id()" to be able to
	process a received OBJECT IDENTIFIER that corresponds to a node in the
	object identifier tree that is not a leaf (that has son nodes) to which
	are appended 1 or more sub-identifiers (the first sub-identifier after
	the node matches none of the label components from the node in the tree).

	- Changed some pointer definitions into pointer to CONST to avoid
	compilation warnings. Same modifications in prototypes of some functions
	whose argument(s) or return value are pointers.

v1.0 (04 Apr 96)
----------------
	Initial version.
