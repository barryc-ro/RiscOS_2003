Revision_string (_DL_VERSION, "(@)DL v3.70 (01 Aug 97)")

#if 0

v3.70 (01 Aug 97)
-----------------
	- force DL release if a DETACH_RQ is received while the DL connection
	  is not released. (dl_misc.c)

	- the Na_att_ni_flag was read too early from the configuration
	  structure, causing a NULL pointer access.
	  Appeared in DL v3.67.
	  (mdl.c)

v3.69 (18 Jul 97)
-----------------
	- LAPD / Id Verify Procedure:
	  When receiving ID_CHECK_RQ (answer to an ID_VERIFY), the state of the
	  TEI-Assignment-Procedure was not reset properly.
	  This could prevent MDL from sending subsequent ID_VERIFY frames if
	  necessary.
	  (mdl_user.c, mdl.c, dl.h)

v3.68a (08 Jul 97)
------------------
	- fixed compiler warnings occuring with some compilers when the DL_LAPF
	  option is set to OFF.
	  (dl.h)

v3.68 (08 Jul 97)
-----------------
	- Added support of Position Independent Code for V120+XID options:
	  (OM_CODE_TYPE set to OM_PIC in serv_par.h):
		- added dl_pic.c and xid_pic.h files, only used for PIC code.
		- modified dl.c, dl.h, xid_int.h, v120_xid.c, v120_xid.h,
		  dl.mak, m2.mak.

v3.67c (28 May 97)
------------------
	- DL_MLP: added missing #if DL_FC == ON...#endif to avoid a compile-time
	  error when DL_FC is OFF. (mlp.c)

v3.67b (23 May 97)
------------------
	- corrected compilation error occuring when DL_T203 is ON.
	  Appeared in version v3.67: the 'T203_ATT_I' parameter has been
	  renamed 'T203_ATT_NI_I'.
	  (dl.h, dl_par.h)

v3.67a (07 May 97)
------------------
	- dl_mfo.c: fixed compile-time error (appeared in v3.67).

v3.67 (30 Apr 97)
-----------------
	- extended DL_ATT flag to USA National-ISDN variants.

	- corrected compilation error when DL_AUDIT is ON but ASSERT is OFF.
	  (dl.c)

	- Corrected U frame processing (dl_u_st.c, with DL_U_FRAME ON)

	- fixed FRMR pack problem if (DL_V120 == ON) or (DL_LAPF == ON) in
	  case of LAPB FRMR transmission. (dl_pck.h)

v3.66 (27 Feb 97)
-----------------
	- id_chk_ti(): NT-side: set the TAP state to TAP_FREE after N203 TEI
	  request retries. (mdl_net.c)

	- Fixed a side effect of MDL_ATTACH_SAPI_RQ modification done in v3.64:
	  access to the dl_chan context was missing (occurs in SCI NA-type
	  configuration only). (dl_misc.c)

v3.65 (24 Jan 97)
-----------------
	- mdl_user.c: when using the configuration flag DL_TEI_TIME_REMOVAL in
	  the tei_tei_assignment configuration field, a TEI would not be
	  re-assigned after a local TEI removal due to DL errors. Fixed.

v3.64 (14 Jan 97)
-----------------
	- MDL_ATTACH_SAPI_RQ is extended to non switched channel (SCI) in order
	  to support assignment of ROLE to DTE or DCE. (dl_misc.c)

	- added several casts to avoid warnings with MSC 8.00c compiler.

v3.63 (06 Jan 97)
-----------------
	- Discarded DL_LAPV5 option (dl_par.h).
	  V5 LAP is now a separate product located in V5\DL_EF.

	- MLP failure : frame offset problem in case of several ACK in the same
	  buffer DL_ACK_CO. Fix : frame offset is now managed only in MLP and the
	  offset value is transmitted in the DL_ACK_CO.
	  All the SLPs shall use the same LAP protocol.

	- DL_LAPD, TEI management, NT-side:
	  in case of ID CHECK under construction and ID REQUEST received
	  from a terminal, ID DENIED is transmitted to the terminal. (mdl_net.c)

	- DL_MLP: modified typedef for 'mlp_modulo_t'. (mlp/mlp_int.h)

v3.62 (04 Dec 96)
-----------------
	- Adding specific processing of invalid N(R) on timer recovery
	  only for LAPB (it was also done for V120, LAPF, LAP4K and LAPV5).
	  (dl_to.c)

v3.61 (27 Nov 96)
-----------------
	- corrected a comment (dl_switc.c)
	- removed useless double queue discard in relay mode.
	  Not a bug! (dl_relay.c)
	- corrected a compile-time warning when DL_STATISTICS is OFF. (dl.c)
	- m2.mak: changed to avoid linker errors when V120, LAP4K, LAPF, MLP
	  options are not used.

v3.60 (11 Oct 96)
-----------------
	- PARAMETERS: (dl_par.h)
		added 'DL_STATISTICS' parameter (ON/OFF) to enable or disable
		processing of SM_INFO_RQ message.

	- INTERFACE: (dl_int.h)
		extended 'mdl_info' structure: added more statistics counters.

	- Extended DL statistics. (dl.c, dl_rcv.c, dl_snd.c, mdl.c, dl.h)
	- Fixed bug occuring when processing an MDL_STOP_RQ: a message could be
	  lost (not freed). (dl.c)
	- Fixed dl_access_chan() bug in case of chani test for DL_LAPB.
	  (dl_accss.c)

v3.59 (16 Sep 96)
-----------------
	- prepared for V.5 protocol variant (not yet implemented):
		- dl_par.h: added DL_LAPV5 parameter (ON/OFF, defaults to OFF).
		(!!! requires Services version >= v3.48 !!!)

	- DL/LAPF : fixed a problem in MDL_AS_DLCI_RQ when the DLCI is
	  already used.

v3.58 (02 Aug 96)
-----------------
	- LAPF: when coding the octet #2 of the frame header, the DLCI value was
	  not properly set-up (in S_address_load() macro, DLCI was shifted by 1
	  instead of 4). (dl.h)

v3.57 (26 Jul 96)
-----------------
	- DL_PH_MUX option:
		- incoming PH frames where not sent to the layer 3 with the proper
		  NAI if the TEI was the one of a multiplexed NAI (the NAI sent was
		  the one of the physical non-multiplexed NAI). (dl_rcv.c)
		- improved configuration of multiplexed NAIs. (dl.c, mdl.c)
		- SM_NA_POWER_ON/OFF_RQ and MPH_ACT_IN/MPH_DEA_IN where not
		  multiplexed.

v3.56 (16 Jul 96)
-----------------
	- enhanced LAPF processing:
		- 'dlci', 'fecn' and 'becn' fields were not initialised before
		  sending a frame (send_frame() in dl_snd.c)
		- modified LAPF objects configuration (dl_config() in mdl.c)
		- added comments (dl_int.h, lapf/mdl_f.c)
		- simulation: enhanced LAPF frames analysis (ana_ph.c).

	- simulation: added missing functions prototypes (dl.h).

-----------------
	- NT_side: added processing of more than one TEI value received
	  in a single Id-Check-Response frame.
	  (mdl.c, mdl_net.c)

	- corrected 'T201_I' default value: 1sec instead of 2secs. (dl_par.h)
	- updated timer configuration fields description (dl_int.h, conf_dl.h)

v3.54 (19 Jun 96)
-----------------
	- added processing if DL_REL_RQ received in state 5
	  (Awaiting_Establishment). DL was sending a DL_REL_IN instead of
	  DL_REL_CO in case the DL connection could not be re-established.
	  (dl_mfo.c, dl_misc.c, dl_to.c, dl_state.c, dl.h)

v3.53 (22 May 96)
-----------------
	- dl.c: fixed a problem with 'no_congestion' SAP configuration flag:
	  the internal context value was not initialised if the 'entity_id' SAP
	  configuration field was set to any entity but ENT_X25.

v3.52 (07 May 96)
-----------------
	- dl_misc.c: in state S_AWAITING_RELEASE, accept DETACH_RQ and act as
	  for a received UA frame.

	  an addressing error in the frame address field).
	- dl.c: added processing of PH_BUSY_IN and PH_CLEAR_BUSY_IN (ignored).
	- dl_accss.c+mdl.c: fixed a problem when OPTIMIZATION is SPEED in the NA
	  access function, occuring when DL receives a message on an NA which
	  has not been configured.
	- dl_par.h: set default value of N202 to 3 instead of 2 ('N202_I').

v3.51 (28 Mar 96)
-----------------
	- dlx.c: corrected PH_CLEAR_RQ processing. The message to be cleared was
	  not found in the DLX Tx queue.
	- dl_queue.c: corrected LAPX FIFO discard function. May avoid writing
	  at P_NIL.
	- simul_l3.c: suppressed V120 specific variable declaration.
	- dl_accss.c: added cast to avoid warning.
	- dl_snd.c+dl_queue.c: use P_NIL instead of NIL for pointers comparisons.
	- added 'lapx.s' scenario to test above problems.

v3.50 (22 Feb 96)
-----------------
	- dl_state.c: in state 1 (tei unassigned), discard UI frames queue when
	  receiving a PH_DEA_IN.

	  avoid to modify a buffer already in the PH entity.
	- dl.h: use Msg_audit_in() macro defined in serv_por.h
	  (SERVICES version >= v3.40).
	- dl_(p/up)_(d/b)_(8/128).c files: optimized source code generation
	  using compile-time options.
