Aims
====
The main aim of this latest phase of work was to produce a DCI-4 version of
!Gateway including the NetG module. It proved necessary to make certain
changes to the Internet module, and this version of NetG requires Internet
4.08 or later to work. A very limited amount of time was made available for
this task and no bug-fixing of the other Net module variants took place.
Much rationalisation/tidying/bug-fixing could have been performed, but this
has not been allowed.


Notes
=====
There is still a significant amount of code common to mns.c and mnsg.c. I
have not attempted to deal with this.

The module is (mostly) internationalised, but no great effort has been
expended to ensure that this is complete. Some of the SetGtWay utility is
certainly not converted.


Multiple interfaces/networks
============================
NetG looks like it *might* cope with acting as a gateway between more than
two networks. I have not attempted to increase the number of interfaces in
line with the possible number of slots in a Risc-PC.


Testing
=======
Only tested with Ether2, Ether3 and EtherB. Not tested with point-to-point
drivers at all: don't know if this should work at all? Not extensively
tested in conjunction with other !Gateway machines in same setup.
