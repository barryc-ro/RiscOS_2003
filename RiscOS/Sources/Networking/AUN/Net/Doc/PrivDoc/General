Whilst the sources appear to be in a considerable and unstructured mess,
they are much better than when I took them over! Many of the faults in the
code are also not my responsibility and have been deferred from before I
took over the code.

Initialisation order
====================

Originally, there was one order of initialisation, and any deviation from
that led to some part of the network software not working. There is now
greater flexibility, but it is still not perfect. Reinitialising Econet
under the feet of the Net module will still "disconnect" Net from its SWIs.

There is still a problem with ShareFS/Freeway: If AUN is absent then they
will initialise the Internet system and make up an Internet address. They
cannot cope with the Net module starting after this and the Net module does
not use the Internet address set by ShareFS. This may now be improved by
changes to Internet and Freeway.


Aims
====

The main aim of this latest development work has been to produce a version
of the Net module for the Black ROM. This requires it to work in a DCI-4
environment with the new (full) Internet module rather than with DCI-3 and
InternetA, Internet etc. In addition, versions of NetI, NetE and a version
of Net that will work on RISC OS 3.10 machines has also been produced. No
version of NetG has yet been produced. This will need to work with the
latest Internet module without the need for the InternetAG variant, but this
cannot be guaranteed at all.
