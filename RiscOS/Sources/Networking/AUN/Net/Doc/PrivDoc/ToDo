To Do
=====

Examine use of 2 1K static buffers in event handlers.

Amalgamate common code from mns.c mnsi.c and possibly mnsg.c. Far too much
code is duplicated and/or (I suspect needlessly) different.

Investigate feasibility of amalgamating functionality of Net and NetI into
the same module that could cope in the two environments.

Internationalise mnsi.c (and mnsg.c).

Convert NetG to DCI-4 and new Internet include files.

Investigate further to see if user_mode_do_nothing() calls can be removed
altogether (at least from NetE, but hopefully from all variants).

Investigate further Net module behaviour with more than one DCI driver.

Possible:
---------

Use TinyStubs to reduce memory requirements.

Investigate optimise for speed compiler options on performance.
