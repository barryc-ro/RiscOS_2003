I have created this special version (6.15 reporting itself as 6.12 P) by
copying sources from the main directory here and then using the makefile. I
have been unable to automate the build successfully, as the amu VPATH
directive does not function sensibly. In any case, this should never have to
repeated as it is a special version to produce expansion card ROMs that then
do not load the latest version of the Net module deliberately on Black
machines.
