Version Info for Plug'n'Play module
===================================

History for versions after 1.05 maintained via CVS logs.

v1.05
-----
Module now derives upstream bandwidth from NVRAM &D7 and &D8.  Specific
operation is:

Read NVRAM value
Create atm_portspeed line from value
Upload virata.ini file (x.ATMinit, which is hard-coded into module data space)
Upload atm_portspeed line as final line of .ini file equivalent
-

Fixed plug'n'play protocol timing bug which was causing the ATM card to fail
its initialisation.

v1.04
-----
1 Mbps upstream bandwidth


v1.03
-----
Removed rate pacing command from virata.ini ("AtmInit").

Unrestricted upstream.

v1.02
-----
Slight typo in AtmInit meant that 1.01 _didn't_ rate-pace!  Fixed, and upped
to 96 kb/s.


v1.01
-----
Changed ATmInit file to traffic shape upstream at 64 kb/s.


v1.00
-----
Fixed annoying bugs in verbose output

Fixed bug in downloading ini information.

Ini data - none

NIC image - ATM0020/NIC (Classical IP vsn)


v0.09 
-----
Modified cmhg to v0.09

Modified makefile to suit my own build tree.
Tidied up pnp.c.  Tree now compiles OK. (v0.08 pnp??)
