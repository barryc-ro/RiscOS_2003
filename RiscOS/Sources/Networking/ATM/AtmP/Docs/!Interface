Interface information for ATM25STB module
=========================================

This document is an attempt to define the external interfaces of the ATM25
driver software in the absence of any other documentation being available. 
It is being updated as interfaces are discovered/analysed so cannot be
guaranteed to be complete at any given time, but hopefully should save
someone some time in future when using a previously "discovered" interface.
