Bugs in the ATML Panther ATM driver

Outstanding bugs
----------------

Reported   By     Details
----------------------------
3/6/98     CP     Error handling in atm_txframe() is poor; fatal errors being
                  masked out.

26/3/98    CP     In the IRQ handler, asm_get_msg() can be called with broken
                  parameters (picked up by debug macro).  This is potentially
                  a data-losing bug whcih needs fixing.


Fixed bugs
----------
2/6/98     CP     No goof-proofing for bad SWI calls.  This would cause
                  unpredictable results since it accesses undefined memory.

                  FIXED CP August 1998

5/6/98     CP     dib.inquire field not being set at all

                  FIXED CP 5/6/98

5/6/98     CP     atm25_Inquire returning the wrong values (only claiming
                  that i/f has a hardware address).

                  FIXED CP 5/6/98

30/4/98    CP     Not responding to Service_PreReset, so STB crashes when
                  soft-rebooted while video is playing.

                  FIXED CP.

30/9/97    CP     When an AAL5 is being rejected as too large for our
                  buffers, m_datacount is not being reset, so there is a
                  good chance that the half-complete frame is passed up the
                  stack because it _looks_ like all data has been received
                  (it passes the check with the AAL5 payload size).  The
                  really scary thing is that an attempt will be made by
                  rx_dci to read the ** full frame length ** (ie. out of the
                  normal memory bounds!!).

                  This was a problem with another driver based on the same
                  template; the operation of the ATML driver needs to be
                  reviewed, and the m_datacount variable needs its life-cycle
                  analyzed to check that the driver does not suffer from the
                  same problem.

                  NOT THOUGHT TO BE AN ISSUE 8/1/97 CP

30/9/97    CP     module.c : The chaindib being used for DCI4 servicing is
                  static data.  DCI4 demands that it is transient since it is
                  freed by the calling module!

                  FIXED 22/12/97 CP v1.12
