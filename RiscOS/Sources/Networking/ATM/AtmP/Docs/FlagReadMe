Compile time flags for the ATM25 device driver
----------------------------------------------

In the main project makefile, you can specify a number of flags which alter the way in which the
ATM25 device driver is built. If you alter any flags, you should run 'MakeClean' before running 'Make'.

All flags should be present in the makefile, prefixed by either -U to turn the flag off, or -D to
turn it on. Do not delete flags from the makefile - just change the prefix to toggle them. If each flag
listed below does not appear in the makefile, behaviour is undefined.


Flag			Effect
----			------
DEBUGLIB		Output debugging / trace information using DebugLib.  Requires DebugLib 0.32
			or later (may work with earlier versions, but not guaranteed).  Do not set
			manually - use one of the appropriate build files to create a debug build.

DEBUG_TRAIL		Keeps a record of the last 1024 message headers and extension words parsed
			by the irq handler. These can be displayed with the '*atm25trail' command.

USE_DYNAMIC_AREAS	This flag instructs the driver to use dynamic areas for MPEG buffer space.
			If this flag is not set, the driver will use malloc() to claim workspace from
			the RMA. This flag is highly recommended.

FIFO_RECOVER		Setting this flag makes the driver attempt to restore the Boson FIFO to a sane
			state if it detects that it is in disarray. The state of the FIFO, and the 
			number of FIFO recovers attempted is shown by the 'atm25boson' command.

DHCP			This was to enable DHCP to be used with an NEC relay server.  However, due to
			a technical difficulty (not able to specify BLLI) this functionality was
			dropped and has not been tested.  It may be completed in the future if a
			fix for this problem is forthcoming.  DO NOT USE for now.
