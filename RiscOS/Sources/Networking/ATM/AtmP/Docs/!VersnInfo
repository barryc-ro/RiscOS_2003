Version Information for ATM25STB module
=======================================

v1.16 frozen 1999-01-15
-----------------------
Fixed mbuf handling; wasn't using standard mbuf headers!
Tweaks to work with Internet 5.
FIFO recover done on receipt of bogus packet to prevent freezing.


v1.15 frozen 28/9/98
--------------------
Upgraded code to use more modern DCI header files. (Was using old Ant
headers, not Acorn!)

Added dib_inquire field to defined dib structure.

Fixed problem with DCI_Inquire SWI.  Now interface describes itself correctly
as a point-to-point.

Fixed problem with SWI handler - now it will report bad SWIs.

v1.14 frozen 5/6/98
-------------------
Fixed chaindib handling so that multiple NICs are supported.

Removed instances of AL_SWI_BASE and replaced with ATM_00 which is generated
in cmhg.h
CP 28/5/98


v1.13
-----
Module wasn't picking up Service_PreReset (even though it had a handler for
it!).  Modified cmhg.header to pick up this service call.

Integrated module.c (and other subsequent functions) with the file cmhg.h
(auto-generated by cmhg).  Most of the C functions were putting the wrong
values onto the stack, but were getting away with it because they weren't
being used.

Fixed some of the prototyping, too.

CP 30/4/98

v1.12a
------
Suppressed serious debug warning when asm_get_msg() called with duff
parameters.  A QDF to make it look like it really works.  :-(
CP 26/3/98

v1.12
-----
Added support to configure the NVRAM locations which hold upstream bandwidth
configuration. (*configure/*status atm25bw).  This should allow this value to
be user defined rather than relying on it hard coded into pnp.
CP 6/2/98


Fixed problem with chaindib; it was defined as a static, but should have been
dynamically allocated since it is subsequently freed by the
Service_EnumerateDrivers issuing routine. (cf DCI4 spec).

Tidied up some cosmetic stuff here and there.

Removed a stray printf from the IRQ handler which caused the system to barf
if it ran out of mbufs (rather than quietly incrementing a counter, and
retrying).

Tidied up makefile so that static dependencies reflect reality.  Suppressed
warning set 'p' ("Not an ANSI include file", and added error options 'f' and
'a'.
CP  22/12/97

v1.11
-----
Modified pvc.c to check the subnets of the control serve & gateway.  If they
are on the same subnet, then connect the PVC to the server, otherwise connect
it to the gateway, and use routing.
CP 2/4/97

v1.10
-----
Major changes to where the module stores stuff to fit in with the NC's
StaticIP module.  See module.h for details.
CP 18/3/97

v1.00
-----
Fixed a fundamental bug in the linked lists used for MPEG data - they weren't
being terminated correctly!!
CP 17/2/97

Added capability to dynamically change the details of the  MPEG bs_buffer
chain (size of buffers, amount of memory allocated etc).  Default values are
376 (2x188) payload, 36000 bytes of memory pool used.
CP 20/1/97

v0.05
-----
Basis for development.
