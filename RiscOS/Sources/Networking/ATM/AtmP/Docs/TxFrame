SWI ATM_TXFrame (0x47b11)
-------------------------

Transmits an arbitrary buffer as a properly framed AAL5 PDU.

On entry:
---------

        r0 = ptr. to buffer containing REMOTE MAST address (see 'MAST address' below), or 0 if r4 set
        r1 = REMOTE port number, or 0 if r4 set
        r2 -> word aligned data block
        r3 = length of data buffer
        r4 = 0 for first call, or returned socket descriptor for subsequent calls
        
On exit:
--------

        r0 = unchanged
        r1 = unchanged
        r2 = unchanged
        r3 = 0 for success
             -1 if insufficient FIFO space to process packet
             -2 if MAST address lookup failed
        r4 = socket descriptor corresponding to requested MAST address
             -1 if MAST address lookup failed
             
MAST address
------------

These are in Freaky Lucy Format (tm):

        u_char dst[6];
        
where   dst[] = { 0x0, 0x0, 0xAA, 0xBB, 0xCC, 0xDD };

corresponds to the MAST address 0xAA.0xBB.0xCC.0xDD (170.187.204.221).  

Note that here MAST address and port number refer to the REMOTE (client) machine.

Usage
-----

This SWI will attempt to transmit the given data block to the panther NIC immediately.
When called for the first time, r0 MUST point to the MAST address, r1 MUST contain the
port number, and r4 MUST be zero.

On return, if the MAST address was valid, a socket descriptor will be returned in r4 which
may be used in subsequent calls for this connection, until the connection is closed. This
obviates the need to pass MAST address and port number info on subsequent calls, which
means they'll be quicker as the connection resources don't have to be looked up each time.

Note that if the first call to this SWI fails due to insufficient FIFO space, r3 will
still return a valid socket descriptor.

* If on return you get r3=-2 and r4=-1 then you've been jolly silly because no such connection
  exists.

* Using r0=0, r1=0, r4=some_bogus_value is probably a really bad idea, and may lead to all sorts
  of heavy vibes.
