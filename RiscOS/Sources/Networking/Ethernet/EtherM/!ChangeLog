Current change summary from ANT base

Changed files:

locate.c		Changes for NetFax base(Gideon doesn't look for podule
			id chip anymore) and Daytona(NetFax base+ gets ethernet
			address from EEPROM OTP area and not ReadSysInfo.)
statextra.c		Changes for Acorn build env.
MakeFile		Changes for Acorn build env.
cmhghdr			Changes for version type in help string
all.h			Changes for Acorn build env.
ref directory		Removed for Acorn build env.  All files in ref.h
			deleted except for dci4.h and dci4stat.h which are
			moved into EtherM's local header file directory
myson directory		Removed for Acorn build env. contents moved up into
			EtherM root directory.

HISTORY of changes:
================================================================================
Files modified by John Beranek: (The original NetFax/Gideon build)

myson.h.config		- no changes (file is identical, but datestamp differs)
myson.c.locate
myson.c.statextra


================================================================================
Files modified by me (Richard Warren) based on John Beranek's modifications:
(The integrated build version)

07/01/98
--------
myson.h.config		Copied back from ANT sources as there were no
			differences.  Timestamp now the same as original.
myson.c.locate		#ifdef DAYTONA section added to read_etheraddr()
myson.c.statextra	#ifdef ACORN added for differences from ANT base


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
27/01/98
--------
MakeFile		Completely replaced with Acorn Build Env.
cmhghdr			Moved into cmhg directory and #ifdef ACORN & NETFAX
			added

================================================================================
30/01/98
--------
myson.h.all		#include on "mbuf.h" changed to "sys/mbuf.h" for
			ACORN build env.
ref.h.dci4		moved to myson.h.dci4 as it's too different from our
			(ACORNs) dci4 header file.  Would mean to much code
			changes, so moved into EtherM's local header file dir.
ref.h.dci4stat		Same reason as dci4.h above
