They are supplied so you can investigate the problems you've been
having with EtherM hardware. Once that investigation is
completed, or on termination of this agreement by ANT Limited,
you must delete all copies of these sources.

If you discover or fix any software problems during your
investigation, you should tell us and then we may (at our option)
similarly fix our sources and build you updated objects and
binaries which you can redistribute in the normal way. Do not
redistribute any objects or binaries you have built yourselves.
