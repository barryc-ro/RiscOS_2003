--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To Build:

ACORN NOT defined:	This should give you the ANT build (Never do this,
			it should work, but will produce a slightly different
			binary from the actuall ANT one due to tool
			differences - cc, link, cmhg)

ACORN defined:		This will be the same as ANT, but cmhg help string
			will report this is an Acorn build.
			This is done in the MakeFile on the FLAVOUR and
			CHMGFLAGS definition.
			
			USE THIS to produce an Acorn build of EtherM

			With ACORN defined, you can now define NETFAX.
			
ACORN and NETFAX def.:	This will give the original NetFax (Gideon portable)
			build *provided* the build environment doesn't have
			MACHINE=Daytona.
			
			USE THIS to produce the Gideon build of EtherM
			
ACORN, NETFAX & Daytona:If the build environment has MACHINE=Daytona, then
			this will give the build for the NetFax Daytona device.

			USE THIS to produce the Daytona build of EtherM.
			(This EtherM requires the DaytonaHW RModule and
			Daytona Hardware itself (The EEPROM in particular)).
