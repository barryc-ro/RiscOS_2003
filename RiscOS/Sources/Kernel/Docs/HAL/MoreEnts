Initialisation

HAL_Init


Interrupts
==========

The HAL must provide the ability to identify, prioritise and mask IRQs, and the ability
to mask FIQs. RISC OS supplies the ARM's processor vectors, and on an IRQ calls the HAL
to request the identity of the highest priority interrupt.

IRQ and FIQ device numbers are arbitrary, varying from system to system. They should be
arranged to allow quick mappings to and from hardware registers, and should ideally
be packed, starting at 0.

Timers
======

The HAL must supply at least one timer capable of generating periodic interrupts.
Each timer should generate a separate logical interrupt.
