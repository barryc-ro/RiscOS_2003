Note that Funai 3 UI is used by Funai 4 (modem) and Funai 5 (Ethernet) designs.

For Funai 5 a third ISPcapture screen has been added to enable tags for the
MPT mail client to be entered by the user and stored on the Smart Card.
These include POP3 mail server address (for incoming mail), SMTP mail server
address (for outgoing mail), username, password and Email address with the
corresponding Smart Card tags:

	MAIL_RX
	MAIL_TX
	LOGIN_USERNAME
	LOGIN_PASSWORD
	EMAIL_ADDR

Since this mail client is not currently in the Funai 3 or Funai 4 designs, it is
important that they do not use v0.49 or later version of Funai3UI.

If you need to update Funai3UI for Funai 3 or 4 you should start a separate branch
from v0.48.
