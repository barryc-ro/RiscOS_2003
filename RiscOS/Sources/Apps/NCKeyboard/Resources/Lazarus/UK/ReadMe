Note on Lazarus Resource file sizing
------------------------------------

The window in the Res file for Lazarus is 1 pixel larger than the sprites
used within the window.  This is because ResEd rounds to 4 pixels.  The
code within NCKeyboard calculates the required extent of the window by
reading the sizes of the sprites.  (Therefore, don't worry about the single
pixel line at the top of the window.)

Note on Lazarus component numbering scheme
------------------------------------------
The component numbering scheme is described in the France.ReadMe drawfile.
Components are numbered by row, starting from the main keyboard top row,
moving downwards. Each row is offset by 16 (&10), and starts at 1. The
bottom row is numbered as row 6, the keypad as row 4, and the extension bar
as row 5 (reasons for this are historical). The main keyboard graphic should
be component 0. The extension bar component is &999.

The UK scheme is a variant of that used in the French definition. Rows are
numbered consecutively, excluding the keypad. The location of the right side
of the keyboard is one key LESS than that of the right side of the foreign
keyboards due to the fewer keys being present in the UK layout.
