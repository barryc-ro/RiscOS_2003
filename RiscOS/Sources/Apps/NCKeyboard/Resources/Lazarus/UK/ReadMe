Note on Lazarus Resource file sizing
------------------------------------

The window in the Res file for Lazarus is 1 pixel larger than the sprites
used within the window.  This is because ResEd rounds to 4 pixels.  The
code within NCKeyboard calculates the required extent of the window by
reading the sizes of the sprites.  (Therefore, don't worry about the single
pixel line at the top of the window.)
