  Katakana and Hiragana layer generation
  ======================================

  The Hiragana file contains the UTF-8 sequences directly in the HTML;
  these can be copied into the Messages file as required. The Katakana
  file lists just the hex entities for the relevant items. Load these
  into a browser which understands them and save out the page as text
  to get at the UTF-8 sequences.
