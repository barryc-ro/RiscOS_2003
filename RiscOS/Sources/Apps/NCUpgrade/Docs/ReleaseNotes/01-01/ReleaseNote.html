<P>This document is Copyright 1998 Acorn Computers Ltd.
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="overview" HREF="#toc_overview">2. Overview</A></H3>
<P>This is the first beta release to the Acorn QA team.  This release was preceeded
by an alpha release to developers (Steve Rose, Nick Evans, and John Beranek).

<P>Specifications and supporting documentation for the RISC OS-NC2 Boot ROM
can be found in the references section at the end of this document.  Alternatively,
visit the internal <a href="http://www.acorn.com/funai2/internal/funai2/home.html">
Funai2 project web site</a>.  To avoid confusion with terminology, it should be noted 
that the RISC OS-NC2 Boot ROM is referred to as the Maintenance OS in most of the 
specifications.

<P>The Main OS image on the server must be compressed before it can be downloaded
and programmed into Flash on board the NC.  Software for compressing downloadable data 
needs to be <a href="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib">zlib compatible</a>.

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="deliverables" HREF="#toc_deliverables">3. Deliverables</A></H3>
<P>The release consists of this release note, a <a href="./RMFP01-01a.zip">4MB binary image</a> 
(compressed as a WinZip archive) containing the RISC OS-NC2 Boot ROM described in this
document, and a <a href="./csvfile">comma-separated-value </a>(CSV) file containing the 
module version numbers that make up the image.  (Late edit: image RMFP01-01a is identical
to image nRMFP00-00 in case this confuses anyone).
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="problems" HREF="#toc_problems">4. Known Problems And Untested Functionality</A></H3>
<P>
    
<H4><A NAME="problem1" HREF="#problem1">4.1 Welcome Screen</A></H4>
    <P>The application does not yet detect whether it has been started
    at the request of the user or as a result of the kernel detecting
    a non-valid Main OS.  Therefore, text seen on the welcome screen
    reads "You have decided to upgrade your machine ...", regardless
    of whether or not it is the user who has decided to upgrade.

<H4><A NAME="problem2" HREF="#problem2">4.2 Line Drop</A></H4>
    <P>On occasion the controllerless modem will drop the line.  Based on
    observations so far, if this is going to happen it will happen at
    the start of the download before the UI has registered a percentage
    increase in the amount of data programmed to Flash.  It is thought
    that this occurs because the controllerless modem does not bother to
    retrain when signal quality is poor at the start.  (It does
    retrain if signal quality drops at a later stage of the download).

<H4><A NAME="problem3" HREF="#problem3">4.3 Restarts</A></H4>
    <P>If the upgrade process itself needs to be restarted I expect
    there to be some bugs.  At present the safest thing to do if an
    error occurs during download is to reset the box before re-attempting
    the upgrade.
    
<H4><A NAME="problem4" HREF="#problem4">4.4 Soft Resets</A></H4>
    <P>Soft reset does not reset the box as we would like it to.
    For now a hard reset is required by either powering off and on
    again, or by pressing the reset button on the front of the NC.
    
<H4><A NAME="problem5" HREF="#problem5">4.5 The 'Try Again' and 'Cancel' Options</A></H4>
    <P>The Try Again and Cancel options do not always take you to the right place.
    (This should not be difficult to correct.)
    
<H4><A NAME="problem6" HREF="#problem6">4.6 Choice of Red on the User Interface</A></H4>
    <P>The application has not been viewed on either a PAL or NTSC television
    monitor.  Red will tend to bleed more than other colours (plus the NTSC
    and PAL colour encoding of red and neighbouring colours is squidgy).  
    Possible solutions depending on how bad it looks are to try to reduce 
    the saturation of red (and blue and green) and to blend boundaries 
    between colours.
    
<H4><A NAME="problem7" HREF="#problem7">4.7 DNS</A></H4>
    <P>Support for DNS lookup has been implemented but requires an additional
    field to be added to the UI.  The functional specification does not state
    that DNS lookup will be included, therefore a decision has been made to
    leave DNS for now, although clearly having a DNS field as part of the UI
    where the user is forced to enter DNS addresses that are not used looks
    a bit silly(!).
    
<H4><A NAME="problem8" HREF="#problem8">4.8 UI Blockout Whilst Accessing Flash</A></H4>
    <P>The Flash module performs it's work in a blocking fashion.  This means
    that whilst Flash is being erased, written to, or read, the system will not 
    respond to user input.  There are no plans to correct this at present.
    
<H4><A NAME="problem9" HREF="#problem9">4.9 NVRAM</A></H4>
    <P>NVRAM is accessed via a tag file which contains offsets of values stored.
    At present there is a possibility that the Boot ROM will download a MainOS
    containing a different NVRAM tag file to the one held in the Boot ROM.  This
    lies open the possibility of NVRAM being updated through different tag files
    containing different offsets, thus resulting in a situation whereby the contents 
    of NVRAM no longer match the layout specified by the tag file(s).  This issue is 
    being looked into.

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="tests" HREF="#toc_tests">5. Developer Testing</A></H3>
<P>The following tests have been carried out with successful results during
implementation and system integration.  Failed tests are listed in section 4 
above and will be corrected shortly.

<P>An example set of setup information is as follows with the image to
be downloaded on Steve Rose's home mount.  This set of details has been
used in testing to date.

</PRE>


<H4><A NAME="test1" HREF="#test1">5.1 Start up of the Upgrade Application when a Valid Main OS Has Not Been Detected</A></H4>
    <P>The system successfully switches to the upgrade application on start up if
    it does not detect the presence of a valid Main OS.

<H4><A NAME="test2" HREF="#test2">5.2 Detection of a Valid Main OS</A></H4>
    <P>The kernel successfully detects the presence of a valid Main OS on
    start up, and jumps to it, bypassing the upgrade application unless the
    user has explicitly requested an upgrade.

<H4><A NAME="test3" HREF="#test3">5.3 Start up of the Upgrade Application when a Valid Main OS is Present</A></H4>
    <P>The system successfully brings up the upgrade application if the
    box is powered on whilst pressing the standby button.

<H4><A NAME="test4" HREF="#test4">5.4 General Reliability During Upgrade</A></H4>
    <P>The system has never failed between 5 and 95 percent on the progress
    indicator (unless deliberately provoked to fail for test purposes).  If
    problems are going to arise, such as the modem dropping the line, this
    will happen near the start based on observations to date.
    
<H4><A NAME="test5" HREF="#test5">5.5 Downloaded Image Not Large Enough</A></H4>
    <P>The application performs a check to ensure that it has decompressed
    and programmed 8MBytes of image data to Flash.  If the required amount
    of data falls short of this target an error is raised and the user is
    informed that a problem has been detected with the upgrade image.
    
<H4><A NAME="test6" HREF="#test6">5.6 Garbage Data Detection</A></H4>
    <P>If data being downloaded is garbage, the decompression library will
    raise an error indicating that the data it received is either not of the 
    format expected by zlib, or is corrupt.  The user is informed of the
    application's demise.
    
<H4><A NAME="test7" HREF="#test7">5.7 Verification of Programmed Data</A></H4>
    <P>Each block of data programmed to Flash is immediately verified. 
    If a verification check fails, the application deliberately vandalizes 
    the Main OS.  This helps to ensure that the kernel will not mistakenly 
    think that a valid OS is present.  Both verification of programmed data
    and vandalisation of the Main OS have been successfully tested.
    
<H4><A NAME="test8" HREF="#test8">5.8 Correct Information Presented to the User</A></H4>
    <P>With the exception of one function (decomp_close), the application has been checked 
    to ensure that internal error codes are always appropriately translated
    to those recognised by the UI Library, and therefore the user is always
    presented with correct information when an error does occur.  
    
<H4><A NAME="test9" HREF="#test9">5.9 On-Screen Keyboard</A></H4>
    <P>The on-screen keyboard has been minimally tested.

<H4><A NAME="test10" HREF="#test9">5.10 Saving of Setup Details</A></H4>
    <P>The application correctly stores and retrieves setup details to
    and from NVRAM (bearing in mind section 4.9 above).
    
<H4><A NAME="test11" HREF="#test11">5.11 Loss of Connection</A></H4>
    <P>The application successfully detects and reports loss of connection
    if the modem line is unplugged during download.
    
<H4><A NAME="test12" HREF="#test12">5.12 Navigating the Setup Screens</A></H4>
    <P>The user can successfully navigate back and forth between the setup
    screens preceeding the actual download.  Setup information is not saved
    to NVRAM until the user has pressed the Upgrade button.
    
<H4><A NAME="test13" HREF="#test13">5.13 Testing of Downloaded Images</A></H4>
    <P>Two different Main OS images have been successfully downloaded,
    decompressed, and programmed to Flash.  Both have been used many
    times.  The first was downloaded, decompressed, and spooled to
    file on a zip drive and was then compared against the original
    uncompressed image.  The second has been successfully downloaded,
    decompressed, programmed to Flash, and appears to be working on
    start up with the system jumping to the newly installed Main OS.
  
<H4><A NAME="test14" HREF="#test14">5.14 Fading the Stop Button</A></H4>
    <P>The stop button is correctly greyed out when it is appropriate to
    do so.  As an example, it is pointless pressing stop whilst disconnect 
    is in progress because the system is already stopping, so at this point 
    in time the stop button is greyed out.
    
<H4><A NAME="test15" HREF="#test15">5.15 Percentage Complete</A></H4>
    <P>The percentage complete indicator reflects the amount of data
    that has been programmed to Flash.  This looks to be working and
    gives reliable information.  (It takes a while to increment from 
    zero because before any data can be programmed to Flash the first
    chunk needs to first be downloaded, decompressed, and Flash itself 
    erased).
    
<H4><A NAME="test16" HREF="#test16">5.16 Data Validation</A></H4>
    <P>The user interface performs some data validation.  For example
    the user is prevented from moving on to the ISP options screen
    if they have not entered a valid country code on the preceeding
    dial options screen.
  
<H4><A NAME="test17" HREF="#test17">5.17 Failed FTP Password Authentication</A></H4>
    <P>If the user enters an invalid password on the FTP options screen
    an FTP authentication error is raised and displayed to the user. 
    (Note though that the FTP fetcher behaves in such a way that if an invalid
    password follows a previously entered valid password, no error will be shown.
    This is because the underlying FTP fetcher module caches and re-uses valid
    passwords.  It will use these in favour of a recently entered password
    that is incorrect). 

<H4><A NAME="test18" HREF="#test17">5.18 Disappearing Error Popups</A></H4>
    <P>The code has been checked to ensure that the welcome screen will never 
    reappear and overlay the error popup before user acknowledgement of any 
    error that occurs.  This has been partially tested and no problems have 
    been detected since carrying out this check.

<H4><A NAME="test19" HREF="#test19">5.19 Trapping All Errors</A></H4>
    <P>Code for trapping errors such as division by zero, arithmetic
    exceptions, operating system error, stack overflow and so on has
    been implemented and tested within the ROM build.  (The same code has 
    previously been tested and formally audited in another application).  
    When an error as severe as this occurs, no postmortem debugging
    backtrace should be seen on screen (as is normally the case), and the 
    application will quietly exit.
    
<H4><A NAME="test20" HREF="#test20">5.20 LED Support</A></H4>
    <P>The left LED should appear green when the application is running.  
    The right LED should be on when the modem is connected, otherwise off.  
    
<H4><A NAME="test21" HREF="#test21">5.21 NVRAM Defaults Following NVRAM Reset</A></H4>
    <P>Following NVRAM reset the modem dial script should default to 
    <PRE>
    TIMEOUT 5\n"" ATZ\nOK AT*NC2\nTIMEOUT 30\nOK ATDT\nogin: \nassword: \n
    </PRE>
    NVRAM reset is achieved by holding down the delete key whilst powering on.
 
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="quality" HREF="#toc_quality">7. Quality Control Measures</A></H3>
<P>An informal code walkthrough has been conducted on parts of the upgrade 
application in the Boot ROM.  The walkthrough comprised four software engineers
using the <a href="http://www.acorn.com/dev/internal/daytona/project/documentation/checklist.html">
Code Walkthrough Checklist</a> found in the Engineering section of the Acorn Information Network.
Note that some parts of the application and underlying modules have not been walked or
formally audited.

<P>The application includes checks for potential memory overwrites before they
are likely to occur.  Whilst this does not guarantee that the code is free of 
memory overwrites, it provides a little more added safety.
  
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="reporting" HREF="#toc_reporting">8. Bug Reporting</A></H3>
<P>More information can be gained during bug reporting by ALT-BREAKING
to the command line and typing <em>show err</em> after an error has
occurred.  It is also worth typing <em>show error</em>.  It is important
to note that any information resulting from <em>show err</em> may be a
consequence of previous error, so the bug report ought to clearly distinguish
between <em>show err</em> logging and the tester's own conclusions of
what caused the problem if specified.

<P>Further information can be gained by typing <em>ppplog</em> on the
command line and including the output in the bug report.  You can do
this by attaching a zip drive and typing <em>spool izipfs:$.spoolfile</em>
followed by anything you want spooled to the file.  Type <em>spool</em>
to close the spool file once you've finished spooling.

<P>Other useful logs can be obtained by typing <em>diallerb_log</em>
and <em>pppinfo</em>.  Although probably not much use to the tester this 
information may prove useful for the developer during bug fixing.
