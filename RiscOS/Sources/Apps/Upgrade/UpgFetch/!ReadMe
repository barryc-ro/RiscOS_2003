More information on UpgFetch itself can be found in 'Docs'.

Mk      - Run the Makefile 'all' rule with no extra options defined (so
          that means no trusted domain checking, for example).
MkClean - Tidy the build ready for checking back in, etc.
MkDebug - Run the Makefile 'all' rule with debug and trusted domains on
          (see the file contents to see the list of domains).
MkInst  - Run the Makefile 'install' rule with no extra options defined.
MkTest  - Build a copy of the application which doesn't link with debug,
          but uses trusted domains and runs a self-test function on the
          domain check code when started. It exits after the self test.

Presently, all builds put object files into "o". If you are swapping
build type (e.g. between Debug and Test) you'll need to run MkClean
between them, or at least ensure you've put a new timestamp on
whatever files should be recompiled. This may be improved in future.

"RunLocal" will run whatever Absolute or DebImage has been thrown into
the 'aof' directory through using one of the above files. It includes a
Wimp slot big enough for the debug build, sets a path for the Lazarus
UK resources, and gives a URL which will correspond to the test file
output of "UpgCreate" if you build the latter in a directory structure
mirroring the CVS repository layout.
