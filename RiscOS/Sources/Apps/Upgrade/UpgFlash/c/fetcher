/* This code ensures that the compressed OS image is held in RAM before
programming commences.

There are two cases to consider.

1) The image is to be loaded from Zip drive
2) The image is already in memory, and has been passed as a memory pointer.

in case 1) the function fetch_image_from_zip below fetches a compressed image
from a zip disk into a RAM buffer, and returns a pointer to it back to the
main program.

in case 2) the function get_memory_pointer simply returns the pointer to the
memory location of the already loaded image.
