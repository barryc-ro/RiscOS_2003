This utility can create upgrade files for use with the originally
FTP-based upgrade system as described by the erroneously titled "Web-
based Flash OS Upgrade Specification", 2503,047/FS.

In May/June 2001 this utility and the front-end fetcher for running
on NCs underwent considerable rewriting and extension to support,
in addition to OS upgrades, transient (download, run and delete),
resident (download, run, and unlock) and permanent (download, run
and leave locked) images. The utility spits out a packed archive
which contains executable data - e.g. a game - which the front-end
fetcher will then unpack and run.

The !Help file in Resources contains full details. A couple of simple
test files are provided in the Test directory, with another ReadMe
describing them.
