   Purpose:  Build upgrade images for NC style devices

   Setup:

      Icon                 Action/Meaning                         Default
      ----                 --------------                         -------
      Source data          File or directory containing files     nil
                           to be built into the image.
      Output file          Filename for output image.             "Image"
                           separated list, for OS images.
      Type                 Select the image type from the         OS image
                           available radio button options.
      ROM card             OS images only - FLASH ROM card        off
                           booting if "on", else on-board
                           FLASH.
      Display              String to display during download.     nil
      Build                Build to match with for OS images.     nil
      Locale               Local for this image, as a comma       "UK"

   Command line:

      Name                 Value(s)
      ----                 --------
      -s (source)          Full pathname of file/directory to read
      -o (output)          Full pathname of output image.
      -t (type)            OSImage | Transient | Resident | Permanent
                           | Font | Exec ("Font" and "Exec" are presently
                           not implemented)
      -c (card/bank)       If present, program given ROM bank rather
                           than assuming FLASH ROM (bank 0). Presently
                           only banks 0 (on-board) or 6 (card ROM) are
                           understood (OS images only).
      -d (display)         "display string"
      -b (build)           "build to match" (OS images only)
      -l (locale)          "one or more locales" (OS images only)

   If -t is set to OSImage, then all of the above parameters MUST be
   supplied on the command line, except -c, which if omitted leads to the
   assumption that on-board FLASH ROM should be programmed, as opposed to
   card ROM (i.e. bank 0 rather than bank 6).

   If -t is set to any other value, then -d, -s and -o MUST be supplied
   on the command line. Other parameters, if present, will be ignored.
