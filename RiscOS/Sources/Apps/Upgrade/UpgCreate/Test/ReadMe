==============                                              ===========

File 'testimage' is an 8MB ROM image for Funai 8 JP that can be used to
test OS image upgrades (if you wish, specify build 'Fun8JP' and locale
'Japan'). File 'testobey' just prints out a short message and exits;
this can be used to build transient, resident and permanent archives to
at least test single-file archives. For multiple file archives, give
UpgCreate the Resources directory or something along those lines and
extract to some non-'Null:' location to diff the output with the input.
