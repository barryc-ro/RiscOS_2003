Wish list for Draw
---- ---- --- ----

   Fix all the bugs.

   Possible other problems:

         When you drag the bottom right-hqnd ear of an object to rescale it,
      I think Draw 2 used to leave the bounding box of the object in a fixed
      position relative to the pointer. Draw 3 immediately snaps the bottom
      right of the bounding box to the pointer position (and then leaves the
      relative positions constant as you drag). This means that a "null"
      drag as an effect in Draw 3, but not in Draw 2. Probably a mistake.

         The scales of rotated fonts are still wrong, despite some hairy
      matrix munging to try and get it right. The entry on the Font size and
      Font height menus bear little relationship to the size of the font,
      once it is rotated.

         It would be nice to implement rotated text areas and the escape
      sequence \M <m00> <m01> <m10> <m11> [<m20> <m21>]/ to allow text to go
      round in circles and the like. The whole area could usefully be
      revisited, I suspect.
