Tester Email Name: TDobson

Fault Number:                  A-RO-9383

Priority: Medium

Summary: Shrinking text to small sizes crashes the machine

Date Encountered: 04-Sep-91

Test and Fault Description:

Select font Trinity.Medium and enter a text object just consisting of a
capital 'A', in the default text size. Then select this object, and then
magnify it by a factor of 0.06. At this point the machine hangs up.

Jonathan Coxhead 8 September 1991:

   This is a bug in the Font Manager, as the following programme
demonstrates. It crashes your computer with interrupts off, usually.
Sometimes the Font_Paint gives 'Invalid font colour;' if so, type it again
and it will stiff in any case.

      SYS "Font_FindFont",,"Trinity.Medium",6,12,0,0 TO h%
      SYS "Font_SetFont",h%
      SYS "Font_Paint",,"A",100,100

   I've put a workaround in Draw for now, such that any text to be rendered
at less than 1pt size will be done in system text.
