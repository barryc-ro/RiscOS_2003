To Kirk Allchorne from Gordon Taylor 8 Feb 1989

This disc contains some DXF files which presented problems when trying to
load them into !Draw 0.44 - as noted in my list of points (sent on disc)
dated 3 Jan 1989 - specifically points 57, 58, and 59. This is in response
to William Stoye's request that I send copies of such files.

The problem is less extensive than I thought then, as I have since been
able to load all the DXF files (that I have tried) converted from the SKD
 files supplied as examples with AutoSketch. (The reason I could not see
some of the drawings was that I had used inappropriate scaling - hence
 my point 60).

Thus the only "problem" files from AutoSketch are the 2 "House*" files - 
which I drew myself. I might have been using a pre-release version of
AutoSketch, but they will load into the present version of AutoSketch -
though in !Draw they return "fatal internal error (overflow while
transforming point) and must exit immediately".

In the case of the DXF files produced by Euclid - at best they seem to
load but nothing is visible, while at worst (eg if scaling is wrong),
they (eg CopyHouse0) cause a fatal error, which crashes Draw.
Tony Cheal has told me (and I have confirmed) that the solution to the 
former problem is to use a small scale factor, such as 0.1 mm.

Presumably the latter problem (and that with the similar AutoSketch
files above), is also due to the limited number range of !Draw.
However, if so, I feel that it should be "proofed" against this crashing it. 

The DXF files from Oak obviously originated in AutoCAD, so I expected no
problems. Indeed, as noted in Point 57, they all loaded into AutoSketch
(save that Nozzle was incomplete, due to limitations of AutoSketch).
However, when trying to load them into !Draw, they all returned "Section
group missing at or near line 4".
