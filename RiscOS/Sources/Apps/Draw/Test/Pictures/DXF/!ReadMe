David,

Hope you had a good holiday. Here as promised are a couple of DXF files that
cause !Draw a measure of grief. They can be found in net#CS_Happening:&.DXF.

These files have been provided by Mr R J Burn, of Purbrook Park School
Portsmouth. Both work fine with AutoSketch. Hopefully we can provide Mr Burn
with a new !Draw when available?

-Stuart.
