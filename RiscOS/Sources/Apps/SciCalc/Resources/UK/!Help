               !SciCalc Version 0.55 (13-Dec-94)
               =================================

SciCalc is a scientific calculator which runs under 
the RISC OS desktop. It offers 4 numeric bases, 
3 trigonometric modes, a memory and a single level 
of brackets.  Its accuracy is limited to that of 
BASIC 64, which it requires to run. Input can be 
performed using the mouse and the keyboard.

Numeric range:
-------------

  Decimal     - Real values,  -9.9E99 to 9.9E99 entry,
                  -9.9E307 to 9.9E307 displayable
  Binary      - 32bit signed, 10000000000000000000000000000000 to

Alternative keys in non-decimal bases:
-------------------------------------

  NAND                                 NOT AND
  NOR                                  NOT OR

  <<< , >>>                            logical shift left or right
  << , >>                              arithmetic shift left or right
  DIV                                  integer division
  MOD                                  modulus (integer remainder)
  A - F             A - F              hexadecimal base digits

Using the percentage key:
------------------------

  47.3 + 15 % =                      to 47.3 add 15% of itself

  15 % * 47.3 =                      find 15% of 47.3

Operator precedence:
-------------------

Operators are evaluated in the following order of precedence
(highest shown first).

  unary operators
  y€x
  xY
  nCr, nPr
  *, /, DIV, MOD
  +, -
  <O, O>, <<, >>, <<<, >>>
  AND, NAND
  OR, EOR, NOR, EQV

The SciCalc window
==================

The title bar indicates the current base and, for decimal, the current
trigonometric mode.  The SELECT and ADJUST buttons applied to the "Base"
and "Mode" keys cycle through the bases and modes in opposite directions.

The numeric display contains the most recently entered number or result.
Any errors, for example "Division by zero", are displayed here too.
To clear an error, use the "C" button.

Clicking in the numeric display turns the title bar a cream colour,
indicating that numbers and selected operators may be entered from
the keyboard.  When the title bar is grey, the keyboard does not affect
the state of SciCalc.

Note that changing from decimal to a non-decimal base will round the 
currently displayed value to the nearest integer, but has no effect on 
previous parts of the current calculation.  Rounding also occurs on numbers 
being recalled from memory in non-decimal bases.

Start-up options
================

Double-clicking on the !SciCalc icon in a directory viewer installs SciCalc
on the icon bar.  Clicking on this icon with SELECT or ADJUST opens the
calculator window.

You can optionally cause the window to be opened at a chosen place on the
screen when SciCalc is run, by setting the system variable SciCalc$Window,
for example:

*Set SciCalc$Window 700,900

The numbers are the x and y graphics coordinates for the bottom-left corner
of the displayed window.

You can also choose a particular base and trigonometric mode in which SciCalc
is to start, by setting SciCalc$Options, for example:

*Set SciCalc$Options 2,1

The first number specifies the base, the second the mode. Allowed values are:

  Base - 1  Decimal
         2  Binary
         3  Octal
         4  Hexadecimal

  Mode - 1  Radians
         2  Degrees
         3  Gradians

The above example sets the base to binary and the trigonometric mode (used 
when you next change to decimal base) to radians.  The default values are 
1,2 i.e. decimal and degrees.

Quitting from SciCalc
---------------------

You can quit completely from Scicalc by clicking MENU on the icon and
selecting Quit.  Alternatively, to remove the calculator window temporarily,
click on the window's close box.  Subsequently clicking on the icon will
re-open the window in the same position, with the calculation state 
preserved.

Requirements
------------

SciCalc will only run if the following modules have been loaded or can be 
found in the directory !System.Modules.
