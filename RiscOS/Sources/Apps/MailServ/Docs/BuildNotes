BuildNotes for Connect and MailServ
-----------------------------------

Author: S.Brodie
Date:   5 May 1998


This build structure is suitable for building either Connect or MailServ.
Effectively, Connect is just a single-user version of MailServ.

Note that the language specific files (in Resources.${LOCALE}) for Connect
are automatically generated from the MailServ resource files - the only
difference being the change in application name.  This modification is
performed by the sed tool.  Add error messages and the like to
Resources.*.!MailServ.Messages and they will automatically be picked
up by Connect.

Running !Mk will build both !Connect and !MailServ to a directory called
Export in the package root.  The code images are built to the aif directory.
They are then placed in the export directory via the squeeze tool.

Ignore the warning about the cast of a pointer to a pointer to function -
that one's OK.  The others I have no idea whether they cause major
problems and I haven't had the time to track through them all yet  - the
compiler does appear to be right about all three of the warnings, though.

NOTE that if you add empty directories you should add remove commands to
the Makefile to get rid of the CVS tag files in those directories.


-- THE END (for now).
