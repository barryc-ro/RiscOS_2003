BuildNotes for Connect and MailServ
-----------------------------------

Author: S.Brodie

This build structure is suitable for building either Connect or MailServ.
Effectively, Connect is just a single-user version of MailServ.

IMPORTANT: When you have built a release, you must erase all the CVS
information from the exported directory tree.  Use EraseCVS for this - ask
Rich.

VERY IMPORTANT: Do not edit the Templates file without extreme caution as to
which template editor you are using.  The message tags in the configuration
file map *directly* to icon handles in specific windows and when the program
needs an item of information, it just reads the text of the icon.  If you
mess up the Templates file, you will get all sorts of crazy aborts when you
try to run the application.

Note that the language specific files (in Resources.${LOCALE}) for Connect
are automatically generated from the MailServ resource files - the only
difference being the change in application name.  This modification is
performed by the sed tool.  Add error messages and the like to
Resources.*.!MailServ.Messages and they will automatically be picked
up by Connect.

Running !Mk will build both !Connect and !MailServ to a directory called
Export in the package root.  The code images are built to the aif directory.
They are then placed in the export directory via the squeeze tool.

Ignore the warning about the cast of a pointer to a pointer to function -
that one's OK.  The others I have no idea whether they cause major
problems and I haven't had the time to track through them all yet  - the
compiler does appear to be right about all three of the warnings, though.

Also note that the "provlist" files for Connect and MailServ DIFFER in the
names of the system variables that they use.  You must not unify them
(unless you write a script that makes both from one template, of course :-)



-- THE END (for now).
