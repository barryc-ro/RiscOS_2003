CElkins (08-Jan-98):

It is *possible* that this may happen under certain cirumstances, but in
general the headers generated by later versions (2.69+) are far more rfc822
compliant than earlier versions.

Does this still happen with 2.69beta (17-Dec-97) ?
What setup is in use - SMTP or POP3 mail delivery ?

If the POP3 Mail configuration is set up with

POP3 user = be19  (Pipex Dialup account for example)

Then !Connect needs a user to be registered (!Connect/Admin/Users) with
the name be19.

I forgot to do this, and sent an email with a request acknowledgement.
The computer hung with the Log displaying the message "Unknown user be19".
The computer had lost keyboard and mouse interrupts, so Alt/Delete didn't
work and the computer had to be powered off.
 
When the computer was powered up again, it tried to send a 963K Mailer Daemon

MHill (08-Dec-97):

There are two ways of configuring "Post In Location" and "Post Out Location".

Using !Connect Configure/Directories gives a basic dialogue box with "Cancel"
and "OK" buttons.

Using !Mail Mail/Configure gives the same stuff as the basic box above, plus
two other features "Use system text" and "Display all headers".  Its buttons
are "Cancel" and "Set".

!Connect should use the same dialogue box as !Mail.

There are two ways to set the maximum web cache size,
via the !WebServe choices window (obvious) and
via !Connect-->admin-->expiry times-->URL window
which is obscure.

In addition, !Connect appears to force a cache
flush on start up, and I request that this action
is disabled by !WebServe, rather than attempt to
alter !Connect at this late stage.

Reported by <jscott@picker.co.uk> (jon scott) (27-Nov-97):
I have installed the latest components of the new browser etc, 
except for webserve.

I was unable to use email with my pipex account until the latest 
patches were installed. However I have still been unable to send
emails, I can only recieve.

I still experience the previously reported ppp errors reported by
ppplog

I still cannot connect to my outgoing mail. The message I get are

script completed
either unable to find server's address
maildrop locked and ready
number of messages in drop is 0

or i get

script completed

input line 250-smtp.dial.pipex.com - are YOU authorised to connect to me?
input line 221 smtp.dial.pipex.com - are YOU authorised to connect to me?
maildrop locked and ready

when i send my mail I get the   

'....-are You authorised to connect to me?' messages in the log if I send a mail.

CElkins (11-Dec-93):

!Connect 2.68 fixes this by generating headers that pass Pipex's anti-SPAM
checking rules (they are technically more correct anyway, too).

The 'are you authorised...' messages are simply text reported back from the
server - nothing of any importance.

Sorry but I'm a little confused by your mail, some of the reported problems
were fixed in the last connect update (i've noticed no change since dec), I
have downloaded the updates upto 5th Feb and I believe that I still have some
problems with out going mail, since december (after this mail)

I still get the same pppifo and ppplog errors every time, i assume this is
due to problems with the completeness off the  pppmodule (do you need
details of this I sent it once before, probably not on a form, but should I
send direct to you ?)

I get intermittently. (50% of the time)

script completed
either unable to find server's address
maildrop locked and ready
number of messages in drop is 0

My main problem with out going mail was reported in Dec (sometime) is that
my mail (outgoing dissappears very frequently) without generating any error
and it is therefore totally unuseable (it is of course possible that my
reports submitted via browse have also vanished I hope not).

it gets sent out as "FROM: Mike\\Jen@acorntst.demon.co.uk" - not the double
back-slash.

CElkins (30-Jan-98):

This would imply !Connect at fault, since *it* is responsible for the
setting up of user accounts.

On checking !Connect, only alphanumeric and dot are valid entries in the
username field.

Suggest Install 0.68 -> Verify.

Details:

MHill (26-Jan-98):

I tried to send an email with only the words "Large Attachment" in it and
attached an 839K text file to it.

The !Connect/!Mail refused to send it because it said the email was 1133K
and the maximum allowed was 1000K.

If it really is 1133K then the overhead is 1133-839 = 294K

There is no size problem if the 839K text file is sent in the body of the
email rather than as an attachment.

FAO CElkins (To comment)

Will be due to the base64 encoding of the attachment; correct behaviour.

Details:

MHill (29-Jan-98):

This fault concerns all the dialogue boxes that can be configured by
"Menuing" over the !Connect and !Mail icons on the iconbar.

If you start editing a dialogue box and then change your mind and click on
"Cancel", the "variables" are not returned to their previous values.  Not
only are the new values still displayed if you re-open the dialogue box, but
in some cases the new values have put put into effect (e.g. "Connect when
there are n messages").

The good news is that these new values are not stored when you quit !Connect
and !Mail.

MHill (04-Feb-98):
I sent 6 emails using Pipex Dialup.  In the Log, just before it Disconnected
it said
"Unable to open ADFS::4.$.Internet.!Post_Out.PostBoxes"
So I resent the 6 emails.  However, the first 6 emails got sent and arrived ok,
so there was no need to RETYPE and resend.

!Mail is pretty basic and gives the feeling that it's unreliable even if it isn't.
The user isn't given confidence that the mail has been sent successfully. Messages
in the Log such as "Maildrop locked and ready" ???  do not inspire confidence. How
about just a plain "MAIL SENT" ?



MNevilleSmith (09-Feb-98):

The log file messages to not always indicate error conditions - in
this case !MailServ may have found that the postbox was in use by
!Mail, and was backing off to try a little later.

Yes, a little disconcerting, but notabug.

Reported by <richard@knight-soft.demon.co.uk> (Richard Barrass) (16-Jan-98):
The connect application allow the configuration of 'idle' time
but this doesn't seem to be implemented. Basically, if I'm
not doing anything (ie, actively following links) the modem
connection is terminated after about 5 mins. This is also the
case if I am downloading any files (which is annoying since it
means the download is useless).

looking at the server output, it always shows "idle ppp,120" or
something like (even though I have configured the 

"Disconnect when idle" field in Configure->Connection to be
'9999' min.

Also, are there any plans to upgrade the e-mail client ?

I am currently developing an e-mail client based around the IMAP
protocol and was looking to be able to interface an IMAP server
with the !Connect application (since it seems the mail is 
encrypted when it is downloaded). Is this information available
- do I need to be a registered developer ?

Also, on the occasions when I have tried to fill this form
out in !Browse (I'm currently now using Netscape at work)... 
<TAB> key presses don't insert 8 spaces which seems to be
the way things work on the 'other' platforms (win95, mac, UNIX)


Regards,
	Richard

CElkins (30-Jan-98):
"idle=120,PPP" is specific to Demon, and relates to their dropping the line
after no data is transfered for a period.
                                         
The above figure (9999) relates to how long after WebServe last indicates
it's using the line before the line is dropped.

I suspect that the user may have disabled !WebServe, but it would be useful
to get confirmation, or repeat in-house.

Please mark FAO MHill - confirm behaviour, please.

Reported by <jscott@picker.co.uk> (Jon Scott) (1-Jan-98):
Previously I reported that my email was working with my pipex account
I seems that that is not completly true.
My mails don't always appear at the recipient.
The mail/connect programs appears to be unable to detect the error 
and simply looses the mail! this is totally useless to use. combined
with the failure to save sent mails it means retyping old mail
again up to four times so far on occasion! this really begins to piss
me off.
The problem seems to be worse with attachments. I will let you know 
about my findings.

As far as I can tell incoming mail is fine

Jon


Reported by <jscott@picker.co.uk> (jon scott) (1-Jan-98):
I reported that my mail was now working with my pipex account. It seems I
spoke to soon. sometimes it works but just as often no mail arrives at the other end
messages. The problem seems to be worst with attachments but I am not sure
unfortunatley their is no indication of what is happening. I also get intermittently
whilst logging on 'unable to find mail servers address' but I have sent and recieved 
mail without problems with this error present. This is very poor and means I 
cannot use this software to send mails at present.

The mail system should notice a problem and store the mail for it to be retransmitted

I'm afraid that the my opinion of the mail program is that it would rather poor and 
primitive if it worked, as it seems unreliable and does not save the messages, for
retransmission i feel it is unusable.
PLEASE CONFIRM RECEIPT OF THIS AS I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS WORKING
and I will have to report errors through Netscrap.

I have to agree with the Fault Report originator that !Mail is pretty 
basic and that it feels unreliable even if it isn't.  The user isn't 
given confidence that the mail has been sent successfully. Messages in 
the Log such as "Unable to open ADFS::4.$.Internet.!Post_Out.PostBoxes" 
- the mail got sent anyway.
"Maildrop locked and ready" ???
Do not inspire confidence.

How about "MAIL SENT" ?
Having said all that, I sent 6 emails with attachments and 6 without 
attachment using Pipex Dialup and all arrived successfully - even though 
I got the above messages about unable to open PostBoxes (so I resent the 
emails !!!).

empty file "Textfile" and go Save and drag the icon down to a !Mail icon on
the iconbar.  Type in the "To" and "About" fields and send the email.

The email never arrives at the destination - it probably never gets sent in the

Reported by <jonathan@briggs.prestel.co.uk> (Jonathan Briggs) (27-Dec-97):
I have produced a reliable script for the ISP Prestel On Line, to whom should I 
send it ?
If I load !Connect then !Mail with my Mail user name and password and then try 
to Connect.Mail Only (or Mail and news) then the password I have defined as a 
!Mail user is sent to my ISP not my ISP login password. I can not solve this 
problem by using my ISP password as my Mail user password as Prestel INSIST 
on 16 character passwords which users are unable to change and as you know 
!Mail user passwords have a 10 character limit. If instead I load !Connect then 
!Browse instead then all works fine, even if I subsequently load !Mail.
Sent mail does not seem to be saved in a folder similar to incoming mail, for me 
this is an essential feature of any email package.
No progress indication is shown when mail or news is being down/up loaded this 
makes it difficult to know when to disconnect for those of us who have to pay the 
phone bill and where every extra unnecessary second counts.
For the same reason the feature of the news software which makes it download all 
articles automatically from a subscribed newsgroup is for me unacceptable. MS 
Internet News is much better for me as it just downloads the subject of each 
posting and then gives the user the opportunity to decide which articles to 
download. This is done with the threads set to not automatically expand.
Finally !Browse and it's Hotlist are great !!!

The reson the new user doesn't get added is that the "Group" writable field
is empty by default, so the user actually gets added to a null usergroup and
so is not displayed in the "Users" dialogue box.

an awful lot of Illegal handle messages while I attempted to configure

Is there any (draft) documentation on the options in the provider file?
I have built one for our, University of Bristol, dial-up annex server

Summary: !Connect 0 mins between retries breaks

CElkins (01-Dec-93):

As of !Connect 2.65, setting *both* connection intervals (cheap and other)
to zero disables periodic reconnection by the server - subject to testing
showing otherwise.

However, it should not have generated 'Illegal Handle' messages, since an
interval of zero should have resulted in continual attempts to connect to
the server(s)...

Review_Meeting (05-Dec-97):

Install !Connect 2.65.
Verify to MHill.

Retested with !Connect 2.68
Still getting "Illegal handle" messages, but nothing to do with setting
connect to every 0 mins.  It happened when I changed
        from 1min at cheap rate
             1min at other times
             4min disconnect when idle
        to   5min at cheap rate
             5min at other times
             2min disconnect when idle
but I couldn't repeat it by doing the same again.
However it did happen again later and the Log file is attached.

major bug tracked down ! yes really

I'm sure that youv'e had feedback on PC cards stiffing with the 
new setup. I certainly reported it . I have really tracked it down
this time and am able to reproduce it.

With the new setup you recommend that connect is loaded at boot up if the 
modem is off and the pccard is started PCPRO 2.03,then it stiffs the PC 
cxard. With the modem on or connect not loaded , then the PCcard works.

I tried a number of hardware combinations before no effect.

ps i use pccard has direct control of serial port (if it makes any 
difference! haven't tried that)

Daer Martin, dear Carl!

Thank you for the new Intertalk (!Connect) update.

Some bugs are disapointing me now very much, because i am
reporting them now for more than two years wihout any replay to them.

So this is still not fixt for more than two years:

1. The atached mail with "mime code" cant be imortet.
Please make shure that there is a distributing list "Webamster" with one
valid user in that list and put the enclosed file in the incomming dir.
StART !CONNECT again.
With us always "message is truncatet" appears.

2.It is still not possebil to send an Application to all users of an
"Inhouse distributing list" (List = UCS; users: kaiu, anjau, martinv)
Trying to send the new !Mail to them.
Only the fist user in the disributing list gets mostly the complete
!Application all ,the others only get an empty dir with the name Templates.
In the logfile of !Connect "handle either illigal or has been closed" appears a
couple of times.

Will they ever be fixed?

  
New bugs:
3. !Browse 1.28 dose not work in our inhouse network. Always the "censor" page
appears when i try to get a page. Also i am missing the logon sequence like the
!browse before had.

4. All the inhouse mail distibuting dose no longer appear in the !Connect log-window.



Kind regards

Distribution list error is quite reproduceable. 
Create a distribution list with say 3 members.
Send a mail with text and an application as an attachment.
The recipients, more often than not, receive the text
and only a subdirectory of the attachment. The strange thing
is that often some recipients receive all the message, and
some don't.

of 158.152.1.43 or 158.152.1.58

MNevilleSmith (03-Dec-97):

We will remove all references other than basic minimum.

CElkins (08-Dec-93):

The existing references within 'hosts' are

a) Comments only on what is required.

b) Correct !

The file really is pretty much minimal now, further removals would probably
reduce functionality, long term.

MHill (02-Dec-97):

Each time I connected to demon.co.uk the !Connect "Server log" displayed
the message "File already open".  When investigated, it was the file
!Connect.Message that was open.  The file is attached.


MNevilleSmith (02-Dec-97):

FAO: CE

CElkins (08-Dec-93):

Believe this to be symptomatic of the fundamental flaw in the file handling
within Intertalk that is also responsible, I believe, for the regular
reports of corrupted index files etc..

I have been able to reproduce this, the mode of doing so confirming my
suspicion of the cause.

Suggest fixing this flaw is outside of the scope of work for this project.

CElkins (11-Dec-93):

The white strip is a newsgroup list display area - the same tree-like
display that's given when choosing newsgroups in the allow/disallow window.

I didn't know this was presented until I just tried this !

Just pressing cancel causes everything to continue as expected however!

Pri Low
CElkins (08-Dec-93):

This is because the provider, as listed in his configuration file, now has
different descriptive text, as required to address PAN-00968, which
complained that the descriptions of ISP differed from those in the manual -
DemonPPP is now Demon Internet, for example.

Simple answer is for the user to reconfigure the application.

Not a bug.

Details:

MHill (28-Nov-97):

If the service provider gives you a Username, Password, Telephone number,
etc. and then you use !Connect to set it all up, you are suddenly asked for
a "Node name" and think that the provider has forgotten to give you this
information.

So if Username and Node name are the same, change !Connect to ask for the
Username.


MNevilleSmith (01-Dec-97):

FAO CElkins. 

CElkins (01-Dec-93):

These are *not* technically, the same thing, since assignment of a
nodename implies a fixed IP address and DNS record for same.

Suggest a documentation change to reflect usage of !Connect where ISPs are
likely to specify a "Username" rather than a "Node Name", though
alternatively !Connect could be modified as suggested above, and the
documentation changed to reflect where the ISP may specify a nodename as
opposed to a username.

CElkins (03-Dec-93):

!Connect 2.66 has been modified to use the label "Login ID" rather than
either node or username.

The documentation has not yet been modified.

CElkins (11-Dec-93):

Suggest P.Garside address the documentation issue.

MHill (08-Dec-97):

After configuring the network using !InetSetup, the next step is to configure
the server using !Connect.  After double-clicking on !Connect for the first
time, there was an error message from "InterTalk Server" saying "Directory
'!Post_In.Postboxes' not found".  This is because the default Directories
have been specified as !Post_In and !Post_Out instead of
       ADFS::HardDisc4.$.Internet.!Post_In
  and  ADFS::HardDisc4.$.Internet.!Post_Out



MNevilleSmith (10-Dec-93):

Config file update to point to Internet directory.

Start !Connect. Menu over icon and go Admin/Users.  The dialogue box has a
writable field labelled "User".  It would be more obvious what to enter here if it was labelled "Username" instead.

Reported by <jmunro@lornshil.demon.co.uk> (John Munro) (30-Nov-97):
The ability to switch off automatic mail collection would be useful, especially when testing!

Another useful feature would be the ability to collect mail from a host on a LAN
ie no dialling.


CElkins (01-Dec-93):

It's a mail server package - it's not unreasonable that it attempts to
collect mail when it gets the chance : it may be desirable to change its
method of specifying *when* to collect mail, but that's not a simple matter.

Suggest 'Defer' status.

Part 2 involves selecting 'Network' for Service Provider.

Suggest 'Not a bug' status.

CWhyte (10-Nov-97):

When setting up !Connect I hand editted script for network
from eh0 to eb0.

Following this it on 3 occaisons got changed back to eh0.

I have not seen this since so suspect it was prior to
actually shutting everything down and then restarting.
