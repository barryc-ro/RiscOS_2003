#Network Connection
# The MailServ server needs to know the IP address
# of the interface to use to talk to the mail and news machines
# so if the interface eh0 talks to the network then you need to put
# "getifconfig eh0"
# This is typically used if you have a network connected via
# an ISDN router to your ISP
getifaddr eh0
