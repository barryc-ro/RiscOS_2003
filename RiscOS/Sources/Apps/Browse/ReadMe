Apologies for the 'wide' text; the tabulated information required it.

The taskobey files prefixed with Mk make the targets in the Makefile that
are made as part of a ROM build. The others make a local build inside
this directory (or subdirectories within it).

The various object directories are:

SYSTEM=   Object dir  Description            Made by     Characteristic front-end feature

Argonet   o           Argonet Browse         !Argonet    Argo iconbar icon (same .o as Browse, different Res)

          o_surf      Surfboard (RAM)        !Surf
          od_surf     Debug Surfboard (RAM)  !SurfD
          o_surf      JavaScript version     !SurfJ

          od          Debug Phoenix          !PhoenixD
          o           JavaScript version     !PhoenixJ
Intertalk o_italk     Intertalk              !ITalk      Spinning Acorn, original Intertalk-style toolbar
          od_italk    Debug Intertalk        !ITalkD     (different .o from Browse, different Res)
          o_italk     JavaScript version     !ITalkJ

I.e. the 'bouncy blue arrow' browser, the Surfboard browser, and the
Intertalk browsers all use different binaries and some use different
resource sets; other variants use the same binaries as the 'bouncy
blue arrow' browser, but have different resource sets. The Surfboard
browser is slightly complicated by the ROM build considerations.

To make everything non-debug, use !All. To make everything debug, use
!AllD. JavaScript versions can be built with !AllJ. Note that some of
the debug builds done by individual files (e.g. !BrowseD, !ITalkD)
may build JavaScript versions themselves - check the command line
arguments to Make to find out - look for JSUFFIX=-DJAVASCRIPT.

In Make obey files need to specify INSTDIR, SYSTEM, and TARGET (the final
binary name) - for example, see the !Phoenix TaskObey file. For clean or
clean_all, you must specify TARGET=<anything, really>... otherwise AMU
locks up.

Because JavaScript versions share object directories with their non-
JavaScript counterparts, even though the symbols table in 'syms' is
kept unique, you MUST remember to do a !MkClean when switching between
JavaScript and non-JavaScript builds. !MkClean strips the Makefile
dependencies list in passing.
