Apologies for the 'wide' text; the tabulated information required it.

The taskobey files prefixed with Mk make the targets in the Makefile that
are made as part of a ROM build. The others make a local build inside
this directory (or subdirectories within it).

The various object directories are:

SYSTEM=   Object dir  Description            Made by     Characteristic front-end feature

Argonet   o           Argonet Browse         !Argonet    Argo iconbar icon (same .o as Browse, different Res)
          od          Debug Argonet          !ArgonetD
Browse    o           Browse                 !Browse     Bouncy blue arrow
          od          Debug Browse           !BrowseD
Ursula    o           Desktop                !DeskBrws   Spinning Acorn (same .o as Browse, different Res)
          od          Debug Desktop          !DeskBrwsD
Surfboard oz          Surfboard (ROM)        !Mk...      Dataflex
          odz         Debug Surfboard (ROM)  !Mk...      (Syntax checking etc.; not debug code as it's for ROM)
          o_surf      Surfboard (RAM)        !Surf
          od_surf     Debug Surfboard (RAM)  !SurfD
Phoenix   o           Phoenix                !Phoenix    Acorn on fire (same .o as Browse, different Res)
          od          Debug Phoenix          !PhoenixD
Intertalk o_italk     Intertalk              !ITalk      Spinning Acorn, original Intertalk-style toolbar
          od_italk    Debug Intertalk        !ITalkD     (different .o from Browse, different Res)

I.e. the 'bouncy blue arrow' browser, the Surfboard browser, and the
Intertalk browsers all use different binaries and some use different
resource sets; other variants use the same binaries as the 'bouncy
blue arrow' browser, but have different resource sets. The Surfboard
browser is slightly complicated by the ROM build considerations.

To make everything non-debug, use !All. To make everything debug, use
!AllD.

In Make obey files need to specify INSTDIR, SYSTEM, and TARGET (the final
binary name) - for example, see the !Phoenix TaskObey file. For clean or
clean_all, you must specify TARGET=<anything, really>... otherwise AMU
locks up.
