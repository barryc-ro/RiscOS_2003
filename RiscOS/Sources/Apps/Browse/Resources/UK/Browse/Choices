# User-configurable choices
# =========================
#
# These may not be freely internationalised - the values of the tokens,
# where strings, are compared directly inside the browser. Since the user
# should edit this through a dialogue, it is that dialogue's contents which
# should be internationalised. Changing the values here to foreign ones
# requires the code to be appropriately altered and recompiled.

# Page colours
# ============
#
# BackColour       - Background colour; 0xBBGGRR00 where RR GG BB are red, green,
#                    and blue values as two digit hex numbers from 0 to 255. It
#                    doesn't matter if the hex digits are upper or lower case. If
#                    the syntax is wrong, very unpredictable effects could occur.
# TextColour       - Text colour, defined as BackColour.
# LinkColour       - Link colour, defined as BackColour.
# UsedColour       - Used (followed) link colour, defined as BackColour.
# FollColour       - Colours links flash to when clicked on, before being
#                    followed.
# SeleColour       - Colours objects adopt or are bordered in if selected /
#                    highlighted.

# Font usage
# ==========
#
# FontSize         - Default font size, in 16ths of a point.
# SystemFont       - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' browser will only use system font on
#                    the page (fast and clear, but pretty ugly...).
# Typeface1        - Typeface definitions. The syntax of these is fairly
# Typeface2          strict and slightly complex, so they should only
# Typeface3          be altered through a front-end dialogue in the
# Typeface4          browser.
# Encoding         - Default document character set encoding to use. This is as
#                    follows (these are Internet MIB numbers):

# Page display
# ============
#
# ShowForeground   - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' foreground images will be fetched
#                    as soon as they are encountered. Otherwise they will only
#                    load when the browser is asked to load them.
# ShowBackground   - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' background images will be displayed.
# UnderlineLinks   - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' link text will be underlined.
# UseSourceCols    - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' any document-specified colours will
#                    be used, else defaults will be used instead.

UnderlineLinks:yes
UseSourceCols:yes
ShowForeground:no

# Page layout
# ===========
#
# LeftMargin       - Basic left hand page margin (before list indents etc.), in
#                    millipoints.
# RightMargin      - Similarly, the basic right hand page margin in millipoints.
# QuoteMargin      - Extra page margin for a <blockquote> section of text.
# Leading          - Line spacing in OS units (pronounced 'ledding'). Note that
#                    negative numbers are allowed but may produce redraw
#                    artifacts under some circumstances, so use with caution.
# LeftIndent       - Multiplier used to work out left hand indent of text for
#                    list items etc., in millipoints.

# Fetch controls
# ==============
#
# MaxImages        - Maximum number of images that may be simultaneously fetched.
#                    Must be between 1 and 255, though values over about 25 are
#                    more likely to degrade performance than improve it.
# ClientPull       - If client pull (automatic fetching/refetching of pages)
#                    causes problems - e.g. you didn't have time to read the
#                    page you were on before something else loaded - then
#                    this can be used to turn off client pull. It is
#                    enabled if 'yes', disabled if 'no'.

MaxImages:10
ClientPull:yes

# Hotlist controls
# ================
#
# HotlistPath      - Hotlist default load/save path.
# SaveHotlist      - 'always', 'once' or 'never'. For 'always', the hotlist is
#                    saved each time a URL is added. For 'once', the hotlist is
#                    only saved on browser shutdown (if it crashes, new additions
#                    would be lost; but there's less in-session disc accessing).
#                    If 'never', the hotlist is never saved. Useful for hotlists
#                    being accessed in a resource-only manner, but remember that
#                    any new additions last only for the duration of that
#                    browser session (so use this with caution).
# AddHotlist       - 'top' or 'bottom'. If 'top', new items are added to the top
#                    of the hotlist; else they are added to the bottom / end.
# HotlistType      - 'descriptions' or 'urls', which says it all. [unimplemented]
# AutoOpenDelay    - The delay in centiseconds before a directory will auto-open
#                    if a URL is held over it, or 0 to not do this at all.
# AutoScrollDelay  - The delay in centiseconds before the hotlist window will
#                    automatically scroll during a hotlist drag operation, if
#                    the pointer is within the scroll region.
# AutoScrollMargin - The distance in OS units from the hotlist window edge that
#                    the pointer must be within for autoscrolling to occur.

HotlistPath:Browse:User.Hotlist
SaveHotlist:always

# Global and local histories
# ==========================
#
# HistoryPath      - Global history default load/save path.
# GHistSize        - Maximum global history size, in K.
# VHistSize        - Maximum view history size, in entries.
# ShowURLs         - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' the History menu will always only
#                    contain URLs. Otherwise it will hold page titles (where
#                    available).
# SaveHistory      - 'always', 'once' or 'never'. For 'always', the global
#                    history is saved every time a new URL is added. For 'once',
#                    it is only saved on browser exit (so new additions would
#                    be lost if the browser crashed). For 'never', the history
#                    is never saved to disc.

# Printing controls
# =================
#
# PrintCopies      - Default number of copies to print. Must be at least 1!
# PrintStart       - 'start' to print from the start of the web page, 'visible'
#                    to print from the top of the region visible in the browser
#                    window.
# PrintEnd         - 'end' to print to the end of the web page, 'visible' to
#                    print to the bottom of the region visible in the browser
#                    window, else a number greater than 0 for the number of pages
#                    to fill up after starting printing at the given start point.
# PrintReform      - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' the page will be reformatted to fit
#                    the paper size (else it is printed at a width determined by
#                    the browser window, which may mean it overflows the right
#                    hand edge of the paper or does not use the full page width).
#                    Reformatting can take quite a long time, hence this is
#                    optional. When using 'visible' for PrintStart or PrintEnd,
#                    this option is ignored and reformatting does not take place,
#                    as reformatting would change the visible region, if it was
#                    done in the window rather than internally for the printer.
# PrintOrient      - 'upright' or 'sideways', which pretty much says it all.
# PrintBack        - 'none' to print no backgrounds at all (plain or images),
#                    'tables' to print backgrounds in tables (plain only at
#                    present), or 'always' to print all backgrounds (plain in
#                    tables, images in the main page if the browser view
#                    options at the time are set to show background images).
# PrintBlack       - When printing, text in certain places may be plotted in
#                    black. To have all text in black, use 'all', or to have
#                    all text appearing in the colours as seen on the actual
#                    web page, use 'none'. Finally, you can specify that black
#                    text should be used for any part of the page where no
#                    background will be printed - for this, use 'bg'.
# PrintPlain       - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' then as soon as a print dialogue is
#                    opened for a browser any background images will be
#                    forcibly turned off (until the dialogue is closed).

# Toolbar controls
# ================
#
# URLbar           - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' new browser windows will have URL
#                    bars present.
# ButtonBar        - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' new browser windows will have button
#                    bars present.
# StatusBar        - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' new browser windows will have status
#                    bars present.
# MoveGadgets      - 'never', 'at end', or 'during' - gadgets in toolbars are
#                    never moved to fit inside the browser window, only moved at
#                    the end of a resize operation, or moved during a resize
#                    operation, respectively.

# Window controls
# ===============
#
# Width            - Default browser window width, in OS units.
# Height           - Default browser window height, in OS units.
# OverrideX        - The X position to open the window at, or 0 for centred.
# OverrideY        - The Y position to open the window at, or 0 for centred.
# SolidResize      - 'yes', 'no' or 'always'. If 'yes' frame border resizes will
#                    be solid, unless the CMOS RAM window solid resize bit is
#                    clear. If 'no', frame border resizes will never be solid
#                    (a dashed outline shows what the window sizes are), or
#                    if 'always', the drag is always solid, regardless of CMOS
#                    RAM settings.
# FullScreen       - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' the window will open full screen,
#                    else it will open at the default page size.
# HScroll          - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' a horizontal scroll bar will be
#                    visible when Full Screen. Can also have 'auto', to
#                    add or remove scroll bars automatically, if the Wimp
#                    variant the browser runs on supports this. If the
#                    Wimp doesn't, this will work the same as 'yes'.
# VScroll          - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' a vertical scroll bar will be
#                    visible when Full Screen. As for HScroll, can also
#                    have 'auto' with the right Wimp.

# Reformatter controls
# ====================
#
# RefoWait         - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' the browser will wait for a time
#                    determined by 'RefoTime' (see below) before doing a page
#                    reformat - can be useful if frequent reformats when unsized
#                    images come in (for example) are proving annoying.
# RefoHang         - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' the page will not reformat past an
#                    unsized image - the browser will wait until that image's
#                    size is known. For slow sites this may take a long time.
#                    [Unimplemented]
# RefoTime         - If RefoWait is 'yes', the time in centiseconds between
#                    queued reformats (urgent reformats may force this earlier
#                    though - e.g. document fetch completed).

RefoWait:no
RefoHang:no
RefoTime:500

# Input device controls
# =====================
#
# FixedPtr         - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' the pointer will change shape as it
#                    moves over certain objects on the page (e.g. a link).
#                    Otherwise it stays the standard pointer shape, over the page.
# HighlightLks     - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' links (and some other objects) will
#                    be highlighted as the pointer moves over them.
# KeyboardCtl      - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' links (and some other objects) will
#                    be selectable from the keyboard.

FixedPtr:no

# Multiuser environments and proxying
# ===================================
#
# PostIn           - Post-in path for mail, or '<none>'.
# PostOut          - Post-out path for mail, or '<none>'.
# Clone            - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' say we're Netscape compatible.
# UseProxy         - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' proxying will be used so the value
#                    of the next two items is important.
# ProxyAddress     - The full base URL of the proxy server to use, including the
