# Main and dialler status messages
# ================================
#
# Status bar messages. Putting a '-' in front of one will stop a byte
# counter being appended if the Controls file specifies that such text
# should be added (so you can override for specific messages that
# never want a byte counter). 'Actv' is an exception; it's appended
# to the 'Page' or 'Ready' messages for cases where the status has
# dropped to 'Viewing' but there is still activity going on.

Ready:-Ready
Page:-Viewing ”%%s•
Actv: (active)
LinkTo:-Link to ”%%s•

# each group of three, the first is for when the URL is known and only
# one such action is in progress (e.g. fetching a non-frames page). The
# second is used if a URL cannot be determined locally for whatever
# reason; the last is used if there are several similar actions (e.g.
# fetching several frames in a frames page).

# is done as '%%'. Then you must double up again to cope with MessageTrans;
# so for a single % in the output, put *four* in here.
