# Main and dialler status messages
# ================================
#
# Status bar messages. Putting a '-' in front of one will stop a byte
# counter being appended if the Controls file specifies that such text
# should be added (so you can override for specific messages that
# never want a byte counter). 'Actv' is an exception; it's appended
# to the 'Page' or 'Ready' messages for cases where the status has
# dropped to 'Viewing' but there is still activity going on.

Actv: (active)

# each group of three, the first is for when the URL is known and only
# one such action is in progress (e.g. fetching a non-frames page). The
# second is used if a URL cannot be determined locally for whatever
# reason; the last is used if there are several similar actions (e.g.
# fetching several frames in a frames page).
