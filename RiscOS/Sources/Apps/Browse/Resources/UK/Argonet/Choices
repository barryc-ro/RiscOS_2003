# User-configurable choices
# =========================
#
# These may not be freely internationalised - the values of the tokens,
# where strings, are compared directly inside the browser. Since the user
# should edit this through a dialogue, it is that dialogue's contents which
# should be internationalised. Changing the values here to foreign ones
# requires the code to be appropriately altered and recompiled.

# URLs
# ====
#
# HomePage       - The URL that the browser defaults to on loading.

# Page colours
# ============
#
# BackColour     - Background colour; 0xBBGGRR00 where RR GG BB are red, green,
#                  and blue values as two digit hex numbers from 0 to 255. It
#                  doesn't matter if the hex digits are upper or lower case. If
#                  the syntax is wrong, very unpredictable effects could occur.
# TextColour     - Text colour, defined as BackColour.
# LinkColour     - Link colour, defined as BackColour.
# UsedColour     - Used (followed) link colour, defined as BackColour.
# FollColour     - Colours links flash to when clicked on, before being
#                  followed.
# SeleColour     - Colours objects adopt or are bordered in if selected /
#                  highlighted.

# Font usage
# ==========
#
# FontSize       - Default font size, in points. Between 6 and 24; fractions
#                  will be ignored (so 12.9 would be treated as 12, say).
# SystemFont     - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' browser will only use system font on
#                  the page (fast and clear, but pretty ugly...).
# Typeface1      - Typeface definitions. The syntax of these is fairly
# Typeface2        strict and slightly complex, so they should only
# Typeface3        be altered through a front-end dialogue in the
# Typeface4        browser.

# Page defaults
# =============
#
# DelayImage     - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' images will not be loaded until
#                  they are told to load. Otherwise they load as part of the
#                  main page fetch.
# DisplayBgs     - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' background images will be displayed.
# UnderlineLks   - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' link text will be underlined.
# OverrideCols   - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' document-specified colours will be
#                  ignored and defaults will be used instead.

DelayImage:no

# Fetch controls
# ==============
#
# MaxImages      - Maximum number of images that may be simultaneously fetched.
#                  Must be between 1 and 255, though values over about 25 are
#                  more likely to degrade performance than improve it.
# ClientPull     - If client pull (automatic fetching/refetching of pages)
#                  causes problems - e.g. you didn't have time to read the
#                  page you were on before something else loaded - then
#                  this can be used to turn off client pull. It is
#                  enabled if 'yes', disabled if 'no'.

MaxImages:6
ClientPull:yes

# Hotlist controls
# ================
#
# HotlistPath    - Hotlist default load/save path.
# SaveHotlist    - 'always', 'once' or 'never'. For 'always', the hotlist is
#                  saved each time a URL is added. For 'once', the hotlist is
#                  only saved on browser shutdown (if it crashes, new additions
#                  would be lost; but there's less in-session disc accessing).
#                  If 'never', the hotlist is never saved. Useful for hotlists
#                  being accessed in a resource-only manner, but remember that
#                  any new additions last only for the duration of that
#                  browser session (so use this with caution).
# AddHotlist     - 'top' or 'bottom'. If 'top', new items are added to the top
#                  of the hotlist; else they are added to the bottom / end.
# HotlistType    - 'descriptions' or 'urls', which says it all. [unimplemented]
# AutoOpenDelay  - The delay in centiseconds before a directory will auto-open
#                  if a URL is held over it, or 0 to not do this at all.

HotlistPath:Voyager:User.Hotlist
SaveHotlist:always
AddHotlist:top
HotlistType:descriptions
AutoOpenDelay:50

# Global and local histories
# ==========================
#
# GHistSize      - Maximum global history size, in K.
# VHistSize      - Maximum view history size, in entries.
# HistoryPath    - Global history default load/save path.
# ShowURLs       - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' the History menu will always only
#                  contain URLs. Otherwise it will hold page titles (where
#                  available).
# SaveHistory    - 'always', 'once' or 'never'. For 'always', the global
#                  history is saved every time a new URL is added. For 'once',
#                  it is only saved on browser exit (so new additions would
#                  be lost if the browser crashed). For 'never', the history
#                  is never saved to disc.

# Printing controls
# =================
#
# PrintCopies    - Default number of copies to print. Must be at least 1!
# PrintStart     - 'start' to print from the start of the web page, 'visible'
#                  to print from the top of the region visible in the browser
#                  window.
# PrintEnd       - 'end' to print to the end of the web page, 'visible' to
#                  print to the bottom of the region visible in the browser
#                  window, else a number greater than 0 for the number of pages
#                  to fill up after starting printing at the given start point.
# PrintReform    - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' the page will be reformatted to fit
#                  the paper size (else it is printed at a width determined by
#                  the browser window, which may mean it overflows the right
#                  hand edge of the paper or does not use the full page width).
#                  Reformatting can take quite a long time, hence this is
#                  optional. When using 'visible' for PrintStart or PrintEnd,
#                  this option is ignored and reformatting does not take place,
#                  as reformatting would change the visible region, if it was
#                  done in the window rather than internally for the printer.
# PrintOrient    - 'upright' or 'sideways', which pretty much says it all.
# PrintBack      - 'none' to print no backgrounds at all (plain or images),
#                  'tables' to print backgrounds in tables (plain only at
#                  present), or 'always' to print all backgrounds (plain in
#                  tables, images in the main page if the browser view
#                  options at the time are set to show background images).
# PrintBlack     - When printing, text in certain places may be plotted in
#                  black. To have all text in black, use 'all', or to have
#                  all text appearing in the colours as seen on the actual
#                  web page, use 'none'. Finally, you can specify that black
#                  text should be used for any part of the page where no
#                  background will be printed - for this, use 'bg'.
# PrintPlain     - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' then as soon as a print dialogue is
#                  opened for a browser any background images will be
#                  forcibly turned off (until the dialogue is closed).

# Toolbar controls
# ================
#
# DefURLbar      - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' new browser windows will have URL
#                  bars present.
# DefButtonBar   - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' new browser windows will have button
#                  bars present.
# DefStatusBar   - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' new browser windows will have status
#                  bars present.
# MoveGadgets    - '0', '1', or '2'. If '0', gadgets are never moved on the
#                  toolbars to fit inside the window. If '1', gadgets are moved
#                  at the end of any resize actions. If '2', gadgets are moved
#                  during resize actions.
# UseSmall       - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' then small fetch windows will be
#                  used for Shift+Click object saves rather than full browser
#                  windows (including Select or Adjust clicks). If 'no', then
#                  a full browser will be used - the current browser if
#                  Shift+Select clicks are done, or a new, blank browser window
#                  if Shift+Adjust is used instead.

# Window controls
# ===============
#
# DefWidth       - Default browser window width, in OS units.
# DefHeight      - Default browser window height, in OS units.
# OverrideX      - The X position to open the window at, or 0 for centred.
# OverrideY      - The Y position to open the window at, or 0 for centred.
# SolidResize    - 'yes', 'no' or 'always'. If 'yes' frame border resizes will
#                  be solid, unless the CMOS RAM window solid resize bit is
#                  clear. If 'no', frame border resizes will not be solid (a
#                  dashed outline shows what the window sizes are).
#                  If 'always', the drag is always solid regardless of CMOS
#                  RAM settings.
# FullScreen     - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' the window will open full screen,
#                  else it will open at the default page size.
# HScroll        - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' a horizontal scroll bar will be
#                  visible when Full Screen. Can also have 'auto', to
#                  add or remove scroll bars automatically, if the Wimp
#                  variant the browser runs on supports this. If the
#                  Wimp doesn't, this will work the same as 'yes'.
# VScroll        - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' a vertical scroll bar will be
#                  visible when Full Screen. As for HScroll, can also
#                  have 'auto' with the right Wimp.

# Input device controls
# =====================
#
# FixedPtr       - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' the pointer will change shape as it
#                  moves over certain objects on the page (e.g. a link).
#                  Otherwise it stays the standard pointer shape, over the page.
# HighlightLks   - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' links (and some other objects) will
#                  be highlighted as the pointer moves over them.
# KeyboardCtl    - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' links (and some other objects) will
#                  be selectable from the keyboard.
