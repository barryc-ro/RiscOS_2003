                          Note that the Choices.c file from ahodgkin_127beta
                          belongs to this tag group - it got updated before
                          I checked in the v1.27b2 sources!
ahodgkin_128alpha         2nd December, not 4th December - checked in and
                          tagged prior to messing with table width code in
                          case everything went horribly wrong...
ahodgkin_128beta          Internal and web site release, 04/12/97 (v1.28)

                          may be incomplete, check-in problems...

ahodgkin_133beta          Internal and web site release, 12/02/98 (v1.33)
ahodgkin_200release       Expresso final release, 19/02/98 (v2.00). Note
                          that all related binaries are unchanged from
                          v1.33 beta, so for checking out HTMLLib or
                          ImageLib, say, you should use the
                          ahodgkin_133beta tag name.
ahodgkin_201release       The "really is final, honest" Expresso release,
                          23/02/98 (v2.01). Note that all libraries are
                          unchanged, so use the ahodgkin_133beta tag for
                          those.
ahodgkin_202release       First release to include Intertalk multiuser
                          capability (SINGLE_USER not defined at compile
                          time). 19/02/98 (v2.02).
ahodgkin_204release       Internal release, 14/04/98 (v2.04).
ahodgkin_205release       Single and multi-user public release, 21/04/98

ahodgkin_206intermediate  Intermediate check-in, 02/07/98 (post-v2.05).
                          Due to CVS crashing at the server this check-in
                          is incomplete; you should NOT check out files
                          under this tag.
ahodgkin_206release       Single and multi-user public release, 09/07/98
                          (v2.06).
