                of support for Navigator, Document and Screen objects.

09/09/98 (ADH): Placeholder description of Location / URL object support.
                Window object description added.

17/08/99 (ADH): Window object - can now call close(), focus(), blur().
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Navigator object
================

Supported:   The following properties may be read -

             userAgent      (e.g. "Mozilla/4.01 (Compatible; Acorn Browse
                                  2.06 [09-Jul-1998]; RISC OS 3.71)")
             appCodeName    (e.g. "Browse")
             appVersion     (e.g. "2.06 (09-Jul-1998)")
             appName        (e.g. "Acorn Browse")
             language       (e.g. "en")
             platform       (e.g. "RISC OS")

             Neither the Mozilla source nor Browse allow setting of
             property values for this object.

             The following methods may be called -

             javaEnabled()  (always returns boolean "true", even if plug-in
                             support is turned off in Choices)
             taintEnabled() (always returns boolean "false")

Variations:  Mozilla source constructs userAgent from appCodeName, a forwards
             slash, and appVersion. Browse builds more detailed version info
             for userAgent than it returns in appVersion.

Unsupported: The following are undefined -

             securityPolicy
             preference()
             savePreferences()
             isNetscapeDefault()
             makeNetscapeDefault()

Other notes: Most values are read from the Messages file; appCodeName from
             the "_TaskName" token, appVersion from "Version", appName from
             "FullName", language from "JSLanguage", and platform from
             "JSPlatform". The defaults in the absence of these tokens
             is hard-coded to "Browse", "(Unknown!)", "Acorn Browse", "en"
             and "RISCOS" (note the lack of a space here).

             The implementation of this object is considered incomplete.
             It is, however, unlikely that any functional changes will need
             to be made or will take place in the near future.


Window object
=============

Supported:   The following properties may be read -

             length      (always "-1")
             frames      (part of frames array; returns a Window object)
             parent      (part of frames array; returns a Window object)
             top         (part of frames array; returns a Window object)
             self        (returns this Window object)
             name        (returns this window's name, e.g. "navigation")
             opener      (returns object that opened this with window.open())
             innerWidth  (e.g. "638")
             innerHeight (e.g. "690")
             outerWidth  (e.g. "659")
             outerHeight (e.g. "730")
             screenX     (e.g. "677")
             screenY     (e.g. "0")
             pageXOffset (e.g. "112")
             pageYOffset (e.g. "16")
             secure      (always "false")
             frameRate   (always "50")
             offscreenBuffering (always "false")

             The following properties may be set -

             opener
             name
             innerWidth  (but no window size change will occur)
             innerHeight (but no window size change will occur)
             outerWidth  (but no window size change will occur)
             outerHeight (but no window size change will occur)
             screenX
             screenY

             The following methods may be called -

             alert()
             confirm()
             open()
             close() - currently there is no security on this!
             back()
             forward()
             home()
             stop()
             blur()
             focus()

Variations:  In the parameter string to window.open(), some items are not
             supported or have no equivalence. For example, there is never
             a menu bar in a RISC OS application. A window will always be
             resizeable and have a full set of window tools currently.
             Height and width are subject to the minimum size settings
             specified in the Res file (rather than the 100 x 100 pixels
             unless in a signed script restriction imposed by Navigator as
             a security measure). Supported parameters are:

             width
             innerWidth
             outerWidth
             height
             innerHeight
             outerHeight
             screenX
             screenY
             toolbar
             location
             status

Unsupported: The following are undefined -

             clearTimeout()
             clearInterval()
             close()
             setZOptions()
             setHotkeys()
             setResizable()
             prompt()
             etTimeout_str,()
             etInterval_str,()
             delay()
             escape()
             unescape()
             m_blur_str,()
             m_focus_str,()
             m_scroll_str,()
             scrollTo()
             scrollBy()
             moveTo()
             moveBy()
             resizeTo()
             resizeBy()
             captureEvents()
             releaseEvents()
             enableExternalCapture()
             disableExternalCapture()
             compromisePrincipals()
             downgradePrincipals()
             find()
             print()
             openFile()
             atob()
             btoa()
             taint()
             untaint()

             The following are defined but return no value when read -

             status
             defaultStatus
             closed

Other notes: The Window object is critically important to JavaScript and
             as such has a very large body of code associated with it.
             There may be many minor functional variations from Navigator
             though it is hoped that these will be minimised and fully
             documented once the object is completed and the variations
             become understood.

             The implementation of this object is considered incomplete.
             It is likely that currently unspecified functional additions
             will be made to this code at some point in the future.


Document object
===============

Supported:   The following properties may be read -

             title      (e.g. "Welcome to Acorn Internet")
             URL        (e.g. "http://www.acorn.com/browser/");
             bgColor    (e.g. "#ffffff")
             fgColor    (e.g. "#000000")
             linkColor  (e.g. "#007000")
             vlinkColor (e.g. "#90a090")
             alinkColor (e.g. "#a0a070")
             width      (e.g. "632")
             height     (e.g. "785")

             The following properties may be set -

             bgColor

             The following methods may be called -

             toString()
             write()
             writeln()
             open()     (This currently does nothing)
             close()    (This currently does nothing)

Variations:  Identical HTML will not necessarily give the same width and
             height values when viewed in a Mozilla source based browser
             versus Browse.

             Sitting in a tight loop and changing document colours
             many times may not reflect the changes immediately. The
             last colour set will be shown when the script exits and
             the browser gives control back to the Wimp, allowing a
             redraw loop to begin. Background colours can sometimes
             show up immediately provided something has been rendered
             in the window beforehand.

             Because open() and close() do nothing, one script which
             tries to write to another document through a stream set
             up with these methods will instead write to its own
             source document.

Unsupported: The following are undefined -

             clear()
             captureEvents()
             releaseEvents()
             getSelection()
             getObjectAt()

             The following are defined but return no value when read -

             length
             elements
             forms
             links
             anchors
             applets
             embeds
             plugins
             images
             layers
             referrer
             lastModified
             loadedDate
             cookie
             domain

             The following are defined but cannot be set -

             length
             elements
             forms
             links
             anchors
             applets
             embeds
             plugins
             images
             layers
             title
             URL
             referrer
             lastModified
             loadedDate
             cookie
             domain
             fgColor
             linkColor
             vlinkColor
             alinkColor
             width
             height

Other notes: The implementation of this object is considered incomplete.
             It is likely that currently unspecified functional additions
             will be made to this code at some point in the future.

             In debug builds, document.tml() may be used to output data
             in the same manner as document.writeln() to whatever debug
             outlet the C "Printf" function provides, which in Browse's
             case is normally a TML card to another computer. This is
             not present in release builds.


Screen object
=============

Supported:   The following properties may be read -

             width       (e.g. "800")
             height      (e.g. "600")
             pixelDepth  (e.g. "8")
             colorDepth  (same as pixelDepth)
             availWidth  (same as width)
             availHeight (same as height)
             availLeft   (always "0")
             availTop    (always "0")

             Neither the Mozilla source nor Browse allow setting of
             property values for this object.

             Neither the Mozilla source nor Browse define any methods
             for this object.

Variations:  No known variations from Mozilla source.

Unsupported: Nothing beyond constraints listed above.

Other notes: The implementation of this object is considered complete. No
             functional changes are expected.


Location / URL objects
======================

Documentation not finished; the objects exist and a URL object may
be created and modified in a variety of ways. Reading the current
Location URL works. Setting it does not start a browser fetch as
expected yet. These objects are in a very early state and may not
be freed when the page holding them is shut down.
