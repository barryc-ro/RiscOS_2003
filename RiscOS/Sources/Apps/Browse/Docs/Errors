Ages Ago (ADH): Created and routinely updated.

08/06/97 (ADH): Added this history. Want to add in the various
                compile-time definable errors (e.g. the
                STRICT_PARSER) stuff soon, but be warned that if
                this isn't mentioned in any history entries
                below, this information is still missing.

18/06/97 (ADH): Add NoMemTab error.

Overview
========

Some errors can be generated from several places. To signal where they came from, a function name or number can be put after the error message. For mild errors (which the user might see) a 'cryptic' number looks best. For more serious internal errors (which the user should not usually see) a function name is more useful, typically. For very serious errors (which the user should never see) the full details are usually hard coded in the error message itself to prevent any possible complications when argument substitution tries to occur.

This file describes the errors (named by token as in the Messages file) that have extra information given about the caller, and details who the callers are and what the problem is.

Errors which are specific to a single callee are not detailed further than their presence in the Messages file, which should prove self explanatory, as should errors which occur only in trace builds. These are generally hard coded rather than looked up from Messages, since they're only needed in a debug browsers.


Mild errors
===========

* NoMemFet
  --------

Report the generator by a number in brackets after the error. Built through the make_no_fetch_memory_error function. Typically signal a memory allocation failure during early stages of a fetch. Generator numbers are as follows:

Number   Generator                   Reason

1        html_get                    malloc for urlstat structure failed in
         (FetchHTML.c)               early stages of fetch.

6        html_get                    As number 3, but to insert X-NoProxy

         (Images.c)                  failed.
14       fetchpage_postprocess_uri   malloc for URI from URI handler that

* NoMemRea
  --------

Number   Generator               Reason

1        html_get_next_token     flex_alloc for store for page data from the
         (FetchHTML.c)           URL module failed.
2        form_ensure_free        flex_alloc or flex_extend returned 0 when
         (Forms.c)               trying to ensure 'n' bytes were available.

         (Forms.c)               failed, indicating it couldn't claim the
                                 memory it required to operate.
8        html_get_next_token     malloc for buffer to fetch data in through

         (Memory.c)              i.e. chunk memory claim failed.


* NoMemTab
  --------

Report the generator by a number in brackets after the error. Built through the make_no_table_memory_error function. Typically signal a memory allocation failure when dealing with tables. Generator numbers are as follows:

Number   Generator                   Reason

1        tables_count_tables         malloc for RowSpill array failed at
         (Tables.c)                  first stage of cell counting.
2        tables_position_table       malloc for RowSpill array failed at
         (Tables.c)                  first stage of cell positioning.

10       tables_count_table          HtmlMalloc for column offset array
         (Tables.c)                  failed prior to position of cells.
11       tables_count_table          HtmlMalloc for row offset array failed
         (Tables.c)                  prior to position of cells.

(Numbers 7 and 8 were present in an earlier version of the widthing code but have since been removed).


* NoMemGen
  --------

Report the generator by a number in brackets after the error. Built through the make_no_memory_error function. Typically signal a memory allocation failure for some immediate operation. Generator numbers are as follows:

No.  Generator                         What failed

1    tokenutils_line_range_r           malloc for array of token_path structs
     (TokenUtils.c)                    when trying to find a token.
2    hotlist_load_directory            malloc to read a line from the input
     (Hotlist.c)                       file.
3    hotlist_load_directory            malloc to store a directory name from
     (Hotlist.c)                       the input file.
4    hotlist_new_directory             malloc for a new hotlist_item structure.

     (FetchHTML.c)                     sysvar when fetching an external image.
9    protocols_atats_data_open_bounced malloc for a command buffer to run
     (Protocols.c)                     an external editor with.
10   save_transfer_uri                 malloc for temporary URI file buffer

     (PlugIn.c)                        Plug-In queue.


* NoMemImg
  --------

Report the generator by a number in brackets after the error. Typically signal a browser side (as opposed to image library side) memory allocation failure when dealing with errors. Generator numbers are as follows:

Number   Generator               Reason

1        image_new_image         flex_alloc or flex_extend for image_info
         (Images.c)              structure or image data failed.
2        image_process_null      flex_alloc for data in ddata block failed
         (Images.c)              during fetching of an image.


More serious errors
===================

* FontMem
  -------

Report the generator by name. fm_define_typeface_explicit (FontManage.c) is the only generator at present, signalling that its internal call to fm_new_typeface (also in FontManage.c) failed to allocate enough memory for an fm_facelist structure to hold the new typeface.


* StrNotFd
  --------

Report the generator by name. These are pretty nasty...

Generator                        Reason

html_close                       The urlstat structure that a particular
(FetchHTML.c)                    fetch handle refers to cannot be found in
                                 the list. The handle is thus wrong, or the
                                 urlstat list is corrupted / out of date.
html_get_next_token              As above, for html_close.
(FetchHTML.c)
html_get_next_chunk              As above, for html_close.
(FetchHTML.c)


* BadType
  -------

Report the generator by name. fm_define_typeface (FontManage.c) is the only generator at present, signalling that a typeface string passed to it has the wrong syntax (in one way or another).


* BadTRef
  -------

Report the generator by name.

Generator                        Reason

fm_write_descriptor              A name of a typeface couldn't be found by
(FontManage.c)                   fm_find_typeface (also in FontManage.c),
                                 so the decriptor string couldn't be given.
fm_write_name                    Same reason as above for fm_write_descriptor,
(FontManage.c)                   only this time a specific font name
                                 within that descriptor couldn't be given.
fm_read_typeface                 A name of a typeface couldn't be found by
(FontManage.c)                   fm_find_typeface - the name was inside an
                                 fm_typeface structure and the function can't
                                 fill in the rest of the details as it can't
                                 find the typeface.
