Browser history
===============

Browse is a multi-purpose web browser originally written in the ART
division of Acorn Group. At this time, only the network computer
division had ready access to Fresco and it was felt that if we were to
be able to freely release products in ART and gain the maximum benefits
from them, licensing the browser was a bad move. From an earlier Acorn
product called Intertalk, a fairly crude HTML 2 browser already existed,
and Browse as it stands today is derived from this. The second
generation architecture shares a lot with the original Intertalk browser
and is now severely limited by it, but building on that code did at
least allow development of a reasonable in-house browser within a very
short time in terms of man-hours spent. At its height, the project had
four people assigned (not all full time), but at many times, just one.
This, for an entire web browser and supporting software components.

Since Desktop machines were still a going concern, the front-end of
Browse was developed from the outset to be flexible enough to serve
Desktop and NC/STB-style roles. It succeeded in this. The software was
not, however, considered at any point to be a drop-in replacement for
NCFresco, and when the ART/ANC divisions collapsed and the sort of ART-
only projects for which Browse had been targetted disappeared, the co-
development of both NCFresco and Browse began to look increasingly
pointless. Several studies were done into working Browse into the form
of a drop-in replacement, and whilst the final documents produced often
contained highly exaggerated timescales, it would nonetheless have been
a great deal of work. Consequently, some time after the product release
of Browse 2.01 on CD and on the J233 Risc PC, the project was
effectively canned. Development has since continued slowly on a one-man
spare time basis with very little work in the last six to twelve months.


Feature overview
================

The current browser implements HTML 3.2 with some parts (notably a
thorough internationalisation model) of HTML 4. The Unicode support
library being used in NCFresco right now was originally developed for
Browse. It lacks *complete* support for, say, Japanese pages, with
some work on the reformatting engine, auto-detection routines and font
switching still needed to completely finish the job (nothing major in
any case).

JavaScript is not supported in any release version but is present
in-house in limited form, based on the Mozilla JavaScript engine.
Memory consumption in the current port is heavy; however the speed is
excellent compared with the NCFresco implementation. The current code
is an incomplete 1.1/1.2 port, with a plan to jump to 1.4 as soon as
possible (this is the core interpreter version - supported browser
side objects will only go as far as the internal structure allows).

Table rendering accuracy is high though at times slow, and the HTML
parser is robust. The reformatting engine is however heavily limited
by it Intertalk roots and has problems with word split points, and a
lack of support for floating objects (left/right floating tables and
images). This last point is the one outstanding required core HTML
feature. Image support is good; JPEGs can be decoded internally with
full dithering or left up to the RISC OS on-the-fly decompressing
plotter; GIFs are converted to an internal compressed form and
plotted from that; and PNG support is second-to-none, with full
real-time alpha blending of foreground images and load-time alpha
blending of backgrounds.

There is currently no sound support apart from what may be provided
via. plug-ins (e.g. no BGSOUND).


Other documentation
===================

A reasonably up to date list of supported HTML features can be found
along with other related specifications at:

with more general information on Browse, its related software components
and some details of the Java 1.0.2 port at the overall support web site:

This site was wholly constructed and maintained by myself so related
questions are best addressed to me - webmaster@acorn.com, as quoted at
the bottom of the pages, is of course no longer a valid contact address.

For details on JavaScript support, change logs, ongoing features and
more detailed software issues see either CVS:

or EMail me for further documentation. Quite a lot was generated to
support one-time customers Dataflex and (in particular) Pacific
Softworks.
