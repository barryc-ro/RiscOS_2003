===============================================================================
Version:	0.07
Date:		1998-05-12
Name:		Simon Forrest
CVS tag:	sforrest_ZModem-0_07

Fixed PAN-01827; previously ZModem would timeout 40 times at the receiver
after the line had been dropped resulting in further ZModem transfers
failing until the protocol had cleaned up after itself.  This should ensure
ZModem tidies up much quicker, allowing further ZModem transfers to work.

Updated the version numbers to 0.07.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.06
Date:		1998-04-01
Name:		Simon Forrest
CVS tag:	sforrest_ZModem-0_06

Changed the number of allowable timeouts back to "2" - as for all versions
prior to V0.04 - in order to alleviate the problems encountered with V0.05.
Why setting the timeout value to "1" should cause failures on Daytona still
needs to be investigated.

In addition two other changes have been made: a), ensuring that only 8 CAN
characters are sent upon an abort (instead of 10) - this now conforms with
the specification of the ZModem protocol, and b), removing the flushing of
the input buffer on TX.

The reason for a) is because in order to abort a ZModem transfer session, only
five successive CAN characters need to be received by the receiver, but eight
must be sent to ensure that five do indeed get through.  Allowing ten was
rather daft, since it is a multiple of five: at the receiver the first five
get taken from the input buffer and the transfer completes; if the buffer
is not subsequently flushed then the other five CAN characters remain with the
inevitable consequence that the next transfer terminates immediately!

The reason for b) is that, because the a transfer request can be started from
either end, flushing the input buffer is a stupid thing to do since this will
discard any ZModem packets already waiting to be processed, thus adding time
to the transfer whilst the protocol resynchronizes.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.05
Date:		1998-03-16
Name:		Simon Forrest
CVS tag:	sforrest_ZModem-0_05

Altered the number of allowable timeouts to "1", and updated the version number
to V0.05.  Although this works on the Risc PC test harnesses, it somehow
breaks the transfer on Daytona; hence this version was never used in a Daytona
release.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.04
Date:		1998-02-23
Name:		Simon Forrest
CVS tag:	sforrest_ZModem-0_04

First checkin to CVS.  No code changes made.  Changed the structure of the
source to use the new build environment and makefile.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.03
Date:		1997-12-11
Name:		Simon Forrest
CVS tag:	N/A  [this version registered in SrcFiler]

Further change made ready for XIP: altered the directory path pointing to the
stored resources; used the ROM switch as specified by Ben Laughton.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.02
Date:		1997-10-07
Name:		Simon Forrest
CVS tag:	N/A  [this version registered in SrcFiler]

Identical to version 0.01 with the exception that the messages file now
contains a "Version" token for XIP usage.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.01
Date:		1997-09-19
Name:		Simon Forrest
CVS tag:	N/A  [this version registered in SrcFiler]

Version 0.00 had a problem whereby the serial buffers were being purged at the
wrong moment and therefore ZModem frames went missing, thus adding time to the
transfer whilst the protocol resynchronized.  This is fixed in this version.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.00
Date:		1997-08-28
Name:		Simon Forrest
CVS tag:	N/A  [this version registered in SrcFiler]

First version.
