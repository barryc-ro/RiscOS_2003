New collectables (to match the new 24 bright colour set).
New aliens/things

Removed protection (you are still supposed to register it though!)
The demo is now the full game, with just a polite reminder to register at the end.
Removed the low-rez 320*240 mode. If anyone needs this screen mode,
please email me and I'll try and do a version for you.
Rounded the font.
Increased the density of the spark effects.

Loads more new stuff, can't remember it all :-)


v 1.12 26 Sept 99

Removed tripple buffering, which didn't work properly anyway, and
may have slowed down on old graphics cards with <650k of memory.
Disabled highscore name entering when in cheat mode.


v 1.11 28 Aug 99

Default background is now plain black again.
Fixed an 'enemies' or 'duel' game type homing shots crash bug.
All the sprites are now generated ingame, instead of loaded from file.
Spaced extra ships further apart, every 15k if score > 100k, every 20k if score > 500k
The game had got too easy with the new power up's. I could get to 10M.

v 1.11 (a) 1st Sept 99 

Fixed bug where there's sometimes only one thing on a level. 

v 1.11 (b) 6th Sept 99 

Fixed lockup bug occuring when not-player-1 earns extra life in team mode. 


v 1.10

Fixed runaway-powerups problem.
Added Install/Uninstall


v 1.09  2/6/99

New power-ups - (surround fire, split-decay shots, split-on-impact
shots, 4 hit point shots, flashing ship protect, recolour)
config in zip file now has slow decay background as default,
because it looks nice.
Error handling is now different, but not working any better.


v 1.08  16/5/99

Fixed a pause-crash bug that happened on one particular W98 machine.
(it should have happened on all machines, but didn't ...)


v 1.07  2/4/99

Added joystick configuration.
Added groovy psychadelic backgrounds.
(re)added virtual screen, to make some background types work faster


v 1.06  6/2/99

The demo now plays up to level 20.
Made the black holes easier on first levels.
Added screen save. Use the 'print' key.
F12 hides the scores, for uncluttered screenshots.


v 1.05, 3/2/99

Added spread fire and homing shot power-up's
Destroying power-up picks it up at half it's value.
Fixed a typo, which I'd copy-&-pasted all over the place,
 and which the compiler does not warn about.
Changed the way the registration key is stored.
All scores can now go in highscores table, with symbols to indicate
 game type
Prevented multi-player games with only 1 player.
Added cheat mode ;), it's on the 'system' screen, somewhere.....
You must now quickly double-press escape to quit.
The 'attract' powerup switches to 'repel' just before it runs out,
 to push away all the things. You used to always blow up.

Fixed the random quit bug, only happened in unregistered version.
Added volume up/down keys F5/F6.
Made the 'tadpole shaped things' sound louder.
