Mousetastic V7
==============

Puts up a fake mouse cursor using windows.

Run multiple copies for odd effects. If mouse clicks fall on the windows
forming the pointer they won't take the effect you might have expected,
so particularly if running several copies, make sure they're all lined
up and not moving before trying to click.

Uses PollIdle; you can make it less responsive (but consume less of the
machine's resources) using Ctrl+Alt+"+/=" (increase poll delay), or
go the other way with Ctrl+Alt+"-/_" (decrease poll delay). When you
invoke this the machine should beep and wait for you to release the
key combination before proceeding.

To quit:

 1) From the Task Manager, quit the first in the list from the top
    down to quit all copies;

 2) From the Task Manager, quit any other copy to leave the first one
    behind but quit all others.

Allocated messages:

  &54E00 message code -> Quit please, if not top task
  &54E01 message code -> Tell other copies about a new poll delay

See the code for more.

The basic idea is Ben Avison's, so blame him.

V7 Modifications by Terry Adams

Doesn't turn the Pointer off so on systems with a hardware mouse pointer
you will have the pointer and the mousetastic cursor.

Reads whether or not the mouse pointer is enabled and enables/disables
the mousetastic pointer appropriately.
