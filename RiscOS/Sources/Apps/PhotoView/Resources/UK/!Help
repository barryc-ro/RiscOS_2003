The PhotoView application allows you to examine
and read the images on a Kodak PhotoCD disc.

As well as being a stand-alone application for
accessing PhotoCD discs, this software is also
used as an example of how to use the PhotoCD
C library calls.  It is available in source code
form if you purchase the full PhotoCD Access
Developer Toolkit from Acorn.
