                  !CloseUp
                  ========

The CloseUp application allows you to magnify the
area of the screen where you are working.

If there is a caret on the screen, CloseUp will
magnify that area, otherwise it will magnify
the area around the pointer.

For further details, read about !CloseUp in the
User Guide.
