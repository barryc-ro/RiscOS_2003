# key configurations
#
# Each line in the file can be either blank, a comment starting with a #
# or a key definition.
# A key definition is an action, followed by spaces or tabs followed by
# a keycode. The keycode is a wimp keycode in hex, optionally preceded
# by & or 0x.
#
# Anything following the number will be ignored so a comment can be
# added at the end of the line.
