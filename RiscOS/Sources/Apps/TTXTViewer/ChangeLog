----------

Fasttext support added.
When leaving hold mode the last page fetch is restarted, forcing a
refresh of the page with the most recent version.

Added index button.

Made page cache persistent over invocations so the current page
doesn't need to be refetched if you go to TV mode then straight
back to teletext mode. The current page will also continue to be
fetched and cached in the background so the most recent version
should be immediately available.

Workaround for problems in VDU teletext code. Box on codes are
ignored if not repeated twice.
