                                    OUTSTANDING (!cd)
                                    ================

*  CDFS, which sits underneath !CD, is a well known pile of poo.  It is being
   rewritten by Tim Roddis and Mike Challis.  When it is released !CD will need
   redoing and retesting to some extent.  In particular, the new cdfs will
   probably have a swi call for identifying the type of cd present but I would
   be careful about how well it does this, since cd standards are not quite as
   standard as I initially expected. 

*  If you have static screen displays on a computer monitor for long periods of
   time, the result can be phosphor burn out - the image gets permanently imprinted
   on the screen to some extent.  Television screens are much more prone to this
   than computer monitor screens.  Hence there needs to be something in !CD which
   dims the screen to half intensity, or which activates a screen saver type thing
   after a minute or so of idleness.  Anthony Frost has something which can 
   easily do this.  I have copied it into Build.Sources.Trial.GenericCD.CD.
   Documents.Fader but I have not yet linked it in with any existing cd apps
   code.

*  Document Dizzy's UpCallV code which has been incorporated into !cd.
   [Priority: Low]   
      
*  !cd will operate in any 16bpp screen mode.  Attempt to make it operate in any 
   bpp screen mode.
   [Priority: Extremely Low]   
  
*  General speed up.  Some speed up should be achieved when the new cdfs is 
   released.
   [Priority: High]

*  Improved splash screen / feedback icons.

*  Update User Manual as and when necessary.
   [Priority: High]
   
*  Add error checking code to !cd for detecting when client applications don't
   return all the memory they used.  At the moment this type of checking has to
   be done during development by turning on the memory tracing flags and
   relaunching applications to see if the memory layout is the same on
   subsequent launches.
   [Priority: Medium]
   
*  Currently the blue button on the handset acts as a toggle for opening / closing
   the cd drawer.  Add to this, the option of pressing play to make the drawer
   close (this being part of the user feedback so far).
   
*  Investigate the possibility of getting a computer generated background done,
   which is common to !cd and all of !cd's client applications, and which appears
   automatically using a piece of ARM code.  All !cd (or client's of !cd) would
   need to do is specify a background colour.  The background itself would appear
   automatically, independent of !cd in a similar fashion to the way one's 
   backdrop works on a RiscPC.
   
*  common toolkit used by !cd and it's clients.  This would enhance consistency.
   The toolkit would contain buttons, counter displays, and other such items,
   including "faulty CD" icons and "unrecognised CD" icons.  Nigel Harper has
   thoughts on this and it would be worth talking to him.
  
*  Come up with a marketing name for the cd apps.  Currently they're collectively
   known as "the cd apps", or "GenCD", or "the third column ROM", or "!CD", the
   latter being misleading and possibly leading to confusion for anyone involved
   in development work because !CD is distinctly separate from !VideoCD etc.
