   updating 'wait_for_ack' will result in the return of the splash screen.  'wait_for_ack'
   indicates that we don't have to wait for the new task to send an I am alive or an I am
   dying message, seeing as it didn't start up in the first place.   If the cd drive is
   locked, it will get unlocked.  Appropriate feedback is given to the user as to
