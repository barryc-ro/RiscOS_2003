   Enables !cd to trap errors such as division by zero, operating system error, bad

   UpCallV initialisation code (for use when the STB is put into standby mode).  Displays
   the !cd splash (PleaseInsertCd) screen.  Allocates memory for polling the wimp (poll_
   blk), primarily used for receiving messages.  Sets up a CDFS control block, which is
   necessary for being able to access the cd drive using the CDFS Driver SWI's.  There
   must be one control block for each cd drive.  !cd assumes that there will never be
   more than one cd drive.  The cd block is created as a dynamic memory area, which
   allows any task launched by !cd access to the CDFS Driver SWI's using the same block
   of memory.

static int MoveTray(int tray_state);

/*
    Opens the cd tray if it is closed.  Closes the cd tray if it is open.   Because
    CDFS does not provide a means of determining whether the tray is open or shut, !cd
    assumes that the tray is initially shut on power up and updates a toggle variable in
    response to handset initiated tray open/close requests.  !cd has to rely on this
    variable to tell whether the tray is currently open or closed and therefore whether
    to attempt to eject the tray or to close it.  If the user intermixes manual and
    remote tray operation, a second remote button press may sometimes be necessary
    because manually operated tray actions will not update the toggle variable.  Note
    that if CDFS attempts to do a tray close operation and fails (because the tray is
    already closed), it does not return an error.  Similarly tray open.  CDFS should
    provide a way of telling whether the tray is open or closed.
    Requires: tray_state, which indicates the current position of the tray.
    Returns:   - updated tray_state.

              - 'file', which is the file in which the error occurred.
              - 'ln', which is the line number in the file in which the error occurred.
