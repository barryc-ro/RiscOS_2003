These applications are for use on an STB.  They're part of the GenCD
(Generic CD) ROM.  A hard disc is useless on your STB when these apps
are installed (thanks to decisions made early on in design review).
Insert a CD and the appropriate application will fire up.  !CD is the
main controlling application and determines which application to start
up, e.g !AudioCD for audio cd's, !VideoCD for video cd's and so on.
These apps sit on top of the old version of CDFS which has since being
rewritten as it was such a pile of poo.  Despite this the only bugs which
came out of official audit were largely cosmetic.  The only bug I recall
is powering on with a faulty cd in the drive.  Since these apps contain
workarounds for a dodgy version of cdfs it's unlikely they'll work well
with the new cdfs.
