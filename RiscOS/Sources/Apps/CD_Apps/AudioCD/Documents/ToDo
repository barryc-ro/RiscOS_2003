                              OUTSTANDING (!AudioCD)
                              =====================

*  CDFS, which sits underneath !AudioCD, is a well known pile of poo.  It is being
   rewritten by Tim Roddis and Mike Challis.  When it is released, !AudioCD may well
   need retesting and redoing to some extent.  Use of the new cdfs when it is 
   released should also improve performance in terms of speed.
   
*  There are plans to have the user interface professionally done once all the 
   functionality is complete.  Hence whoever is taking over the cd apps would be
   well advised not to spend too much time on the user interface to begin with.
                        
*  Program documentation.  
   [Priority: Medium]
   
*  !AudioCD will operate in any 16bpp screen mode.  Attempt to make it operate in any 
   bpp screen mode.
   [Priority: Extremely Low]   
   
*  If e.g. user enters a 2, and there are only 12 tracks on the cd, then it is 
   obviously pointless waiting for a second digit to be entered because there are
   no other tracks on the cd which begin with the digit 2.  Incorporate an 
   algorithm to detect this and hence improve performance in terms of speed.
   [Priority: Medium]
   
*  Repeat play.  This would also allow !AudioCD to be soak tested to some extent.
   Variations on this - repeat current track once, repeat current track forever until 
   stopped by the user, repeat *all* tracks once, repeat all tracks until stopped
   by the user, and so on.  Need to give some thought to the user interface if this
   is to be implemented.
   [Priority: Medium]
   
*  Program option.  Allow the user to define a track sequence which !AudioCD will
   then play.  Need to give some thought to the user interface if this is to be
   implemented.
   [Priority: Medium]
   
*  Fast forward and rewind.  Need to give some thought to the user interface if 
   this is to be implemented.
   [Priority: Medium]
   
*  If !AudioCD comes across what it thinks is a bad track, or if it thinks there
   is something else wrong with the cd, and if this got past !cd, !AudioCD could
   display this suspect information to the user, rather than jumping about and
   behaving in a strange manner.
   [Priority: Medium]
   
*  As more and more enhancements / modifications are carried out, we need to address
   the question of English text usage.  The "Please Insert Cd" text was dropped 
   from !cd's splash screen purely out of consideration for non English speaking
   countries.  It seems silly to ignore this consideration in !AudioCD if it applies
   to !cd.
   [Priority: bear in mind when doing the above and below].
   
*  Need to play around with slightly damaged cd's and look at how !AudioCD handles
   them.  A severely damaged cd was tested and didn't get past !cd, which spat it
   out.  However, more recently a slightly damaged cd got past !cd, !AudioCD was
   launched, and unpredictable behaviour followed.
   [Priority: High]
      
*  Cd player appears too far over to the right on some/all (?) TV monitors, despite
   being properly centered on the source image.
   Investigate and correct.
   [Priority: High]
   
*  Add any info we can get about the cd in the blank area at the top of the screen,
   i.e. number of tracks etc.
   [Priority: Medium]
   
*  Add click on key press.
   [Priority: Medium]
   
*  Add mute functionality.
   [Priority: Medium]
   
*  When playing, display track length in top area.
   [Priority: Medium]
   
*  !AudioCD turns off keyboard auto repeat.  Anthony wants it turned back on again
   when !AudioCD finishes.  Make sure !AudioCD leaves things as it found them.
   [Priority: High]
   
*  Try out drawfile rendering for the help screen.  Uses less ROM space and
   avoids JPEG artifacts.  Have an option so that you can supply either a JPEG
   or a drawfile for the help screen.  Check the filetype and act accordingly.
   
*  Something needs to be done to combat phosphor burnout, which occurs when static
   displays are shown for long periods of time.  One possibility is to dim the
   screen intensity to half after say half a minute or so.  Television screens are
   much more prone to burnout than computer monitor screens.  Anthony Frost has
   something for this which I've copied into Build.Sources.Trial.GenericCD.

*  The JPEG help file needs updating since it does not include the Random Play 
   Mode button (RED).
   
*  Bear in mind that the !AudioCD section of the !CD User Guide should be updated
   in line with !AudioCD itself.
