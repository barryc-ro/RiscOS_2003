<H3>30. Is a short technical introduction to these standards available?</H3>

<PRE>  The file ftp.apple.com(130.43.2.3): /pub/cd-rom/cd-rom.summary gives
  a short techie introduction to compact disc technology.

  There is a good short general article on CD-Rom and its's many
  variations (CD-XA, CD-I, CDTV, PhotoCD) called MULTIMEDIA IN A MUDDLE
  by Barry Fox in the New Scientist (London, ISSN# 0262-4079) vol. 131
  no. 1787 (Sep 21, 1991) pp.35-38

  There is a very good article by Bill and Lynne Jolitz "Inside the
  ISO-9660 Filesystem Format" in the December 1992 Dr. Dobbs Journal.
  Detailed source code examples are provided.  They are planning followup
  articles covering Rock Ridge, CDI and CDROM-XA.

  The SAMS book "Principles of Digital Audio" by Ken C. Pohlmann (ISBN
  0-672-22634-0) deals primarily with audio CDs but there are sections
  dealing with CD-ROM, CD-I, DVI, CD-V, CD-WO, Erasable CD, CD + G and
  CD + MIDI.

  There is a good brief explaination of all these standards in the paper

      "Compact Disc Terminology"

      Disc Manufacturing Inc.

  Here is some information from the paper:

  Standards:

  Red Book == CD-Audio

  Yellow Book == CD-ROM
    Mode-1 is for computer data
    Mode-2 is for compressed audio data and video/picture data

  CD-ROM/XA == an EXTENSION to Yellow Book and defines a new type of track. 

    CD-ROM Mode 2, XA Format, is used for computer data, compressed audio
    data, and video/picture data.  A CD-ROM / XA track may interleave Mode 2
    compressed audio and Mode 2 data sectors.  Additional hardware is needed
    to separate these when playing the disc.  The hardware is programmed to
    separate the audio from the data, decompress the audio and play it out
    through the audio jacks.  At the same time, the hardware passes the data
    to the computer.

    NOTE:  Additional hardware is needed to play a CD-ROM / XA disc.  Several
    vendors offer an XA interface board that will allow an existing CD-ROM
    drive to play CD-ROM / XA discs.

  Green Book == Compact Disc Interactive (CD-I)

  Orange Book == Recordable Compact disc Standard
    Part I - CD-MO (Magneto Optical)
      Consists of optional Pre-Mastered (READ-ONLY) area and a Recordable
      (re-writable) user area.
    Part II - CD-WO (Write Once)
      Orange Book Part II also defines a second type of CD-WO disk called
      a "Hybrid Disc".  This disc consists of a Pre-recorded Area and a
      Recordable Area.  The Pre-recorded area is a READ ONLY area where
      the information is manufactured into the disc.  (This area is written
      per the Red, Yellow, and Green Book specifications, and can be played
      on any CD-Player.)  The Recordable areas are where additional
      recordings can be made in one or more sessions.  Only the first
      session on the disc is readable by todays CD-Players; additional
      software will be needed to read the additional sessions.

      A TOC (Table of Contents) is written during each recording session.
      Disc will have multiple TOCs, one for each recording session.

      Photo-CD is an example of a "Hybrid Disc".

   CD-Bridge Disc

      The CD-Bridge Disc defines a way to add additional information in
      a CD-ROM / XA track in order to allow the track to be played on a
      CD-I player.  the result is a disc that can be played on both a
      CD-I player connected to a TV set and on a CD-ROM / XA player
      connected to a computer.

      An example of a CD-Bridge Disc is the new Photo-CD disc.  The
      Photo-CD disc will be playable in CD-I players, Kodak's Photo CD
      players and in computers using CD-ROM/XA drives.

   Photo-CD
      The Photo CDs will be Mode 2 Form 1 sectors per the CD-ROM / XA
      specifications.  The disc will be written per the Orange Book Part
      II "Hybrid Disc" specifications.  This will allow photographs to be
      written to the disc in several different sessions.  Additionally,
      the disc will use the CD-Bridge disc format to allow the disc to be
      readable by both CD-I and CD-ROM / XA players.

      The photographs written to the disc in the first session will use
      the ISO 9660 format.  These photographs will be readable with the
      existing CD-ROM / XA players connected to a computer running new
      software written for the Photo CD picture structure.  Additionally,
      the photographs will be displayable on CD-I Players and Photo CD
      Players connected to a TV set.

      Photographs written to disc after the first session will be
      displayable on CD-I Players and Photo CD players.  New software
      and/or firmware will be needed to read these additional photographs
      with existing CD-ROM/XA players.</PRE>
