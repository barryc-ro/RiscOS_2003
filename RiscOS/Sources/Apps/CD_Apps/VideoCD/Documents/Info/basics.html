<center><H2>What is a CD-ROM?</H2></center><hr>   CD-ROM means "Compact Disc Read Only Memory".  A CD-ROM is physically   identical to a Digital Audio Compact Disc used in a CD player, but the   bits recorded on it are interpreted as computer data instead of music.   You need to buy a "CD-ROM Drive" and attach it to your computer in   order to use CD-ROMs.<p>   A CD-ROM has several advantages over other forms of data storage, and   a few disadvantages.  A CD-ROM can hold about 650 megabytes of data,   the equivalent of thousands of floppy discs.  CD-ROMs are not damaged   by magnetic fields or the xrays in airport scanners.  The data on   a CD-ROM can be accessed much faster than a tape, but CD-ROMs are   10 to 20 times slower than hard discs.<p>   You cannot write to a CD-ROM.  You buy a disc with the data already   recorded on it.  There are thousands of titles available.<p>
