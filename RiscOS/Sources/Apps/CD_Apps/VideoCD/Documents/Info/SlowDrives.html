<H2>5. Why are CD-ROM drives so slow?</H2>
<PRE>
   Compact discs were originally designed for music.  When you are
   listening to "Willie Nelson's Greatest Hits", you are accessing the
   data sequentially and at a very regular speed.  The only time you need
   to seek is when you decide to skip over a song, or back up and listen
   to "Always on my Mind" one more time.

   In order to fit as much music as possible onto the disc, the data
   is recorded at the same linear density near the outer edge of the disc
   as it is near the center, so there is more information in the outside
   tracks than in the inside tracks.  In order to deliver a steady rate
   of data, the linear velocity of the disc moving under the head is
   constant, so the angular velocity of the disc changes when the head
   moves from the center toward the outside tracks.  This is no big deal
   when you are playing music, but when you are trying to do random access
   to a CD-ROM, the need to accelerate and decelerate the disc is the biggest
   obstacle to making it faster.  Most magnetic discs spin at a constant
   angular velocity, so the data density decreases toward the outside of the
   disk, but seeks are faster.

   A few other reasons that CD-ROMs are slow:  Optical disc heads tend to be
   heavier than magnetic disk heads, so they have more inertia, and take
   longer to stablize onto a new track.  Many CD-ROMs contain too much data
   to make effective use of RAM caches.

   As time goes by, CD-ROM drives will get a little faster, but don't expect
   any miracles.
