<h3>a-characters</h3>
<p>Capital A to Z, digits 0 to 9, and the 
following symbols: (space) ! " % & 
()=*+,-./:;?_</p>

<h3>A-Time</h3>
<p>Absolute-time. In CD-DA, the time 
elapsed since the beginning of the disc. 
Can be used in determining the start and 
stop times of sound segments for 
programming an application on a mixed-
mode disc, measuring from the very 
beginning of the data area (including the 
computer data in Track 1).</p>

<h3>Access Time</h3>
<p>The time it takes to retrieve a piece of 
information. With hard disks or compact 
discs, maximum access time is measured 
as the time it takes to move from one end 
of the disc to the other, find a piece of 
information, and transfer that information 
to RAM.</p> 

<h3>ANSI-Labeled</h3>
<p>A tape recorded with a file structure and 
tape label system which defines the 
Volume name and file header for the 
information contained in the tape, 
according to ANSI (American National 
Standards Institute) specification X3.27-
19778. Most disc manufacturers prefer 
ANSI-labeled tapes.<p>

<h3>ANSI-Unlabeled</h3>
<p>A tape recorded with a file structure, but 
without the ANSI tape labels.</p>

<h3>ASPI</h3>
<p>Advanced SCSI Programmer's Interface. 
Set of software primitives and data 
structures which allow software using the 
ASPI interface to be SCSI host adapter-
independent.</p>

<h3>Buffer</h3>
<p>An amount of memory which temporarily 
stores data to help compensate for 
differences in the transfer rate of data 
from one device to another.</p>

<h3>Cache</h3>
<p>A portion of RAM used for temporary 
storage of data which must be accessed 
very quickly. In CD-ROM applications, 
the cache is typically used to store 
directory files.</p>

<h3>Caddy</h3>
<p>The plastic and metal carrier into which a 
CD must be inserted before it is loaded 
into some CD-ROM drives or CD 
recorders.</p>

<h3>CD-DA</h3>
<p>Compact Disc-Digital Audio. Jointly 
developed by Philips and Sony and 
launched in October 1982, CD-DA was 
the first incarnation of the compact disc, 
used to digitally record and play back 
music at unprecedented quality. The 
standard under which CD-DA discs are 
recorded is known as the Red Book.</p>

<h3>CD-I</h3>
<p>A compact disc format designed to allow 
interactive multimedia applications to be 
played through a computer/disc player 
attached to a television. Especially good 
for real-time animation, video, and sound. 
The CD-I standard is called the Green 
Book.</p>

<h3>CD-I Bridge</h3> 
<p>A set of specifications defining a way of 
recording CD-I information on a CD-
ROM XA disc. Used for Photo CD.</p>

<h3>CD-R</h3> 
<p>Compact disc-recordable.</p>

<h3>CD-ROM</h3> 
<p>Compact Disc-Read Only Memory. A 
standard for compact disc to be used as a 
digital memory medium for personal 
computers. The specifications for CD-
ROM were first defined in the Yellow 
Book.</p>

<h3>CD-ROM Drive</h3>
<p>A peripheral device attached to a 
computer which allows it to read/play a 
CD-ROM disc. All CD-ROM players can 
also play back audio CDs, but you need 
external headphones or speakers to hear 
them.</p>

<h3>CD-ROM XA</h3>
<p>"XA" stands for Extended Architecture. 
CD-ROM XA is an extension of the 
Yellow Book standard, generally 
consistent with the ISO 9660 logical 
format but designed to add better audio 
and video capabilities (taken from the 
CD-I standard) so that CD-ROM can 
more easily be used for multimedia 
applications. CD-ROM XA is also the 
physical format for Photo CD discs.</p>

<h3>CD-WO</h3> 
<p>Compact Disc-Write Once. Recordable 
compact disc.</p>

<h3>CDTV</h3>
<p>Commodore's entry into the consumer 
multimedia market, a compact disc 
player/computer that connects to a home 
television screen. Uses a proprietary disc 
format based on the ISO 9660 standard.</p>

<h3>Close Disc</h3>
<p>To "close" a recordable disc so that no 
further data can be written to it. This is 
done when the last session's lead-in is 
written - the next writeable address is 
not recorded in that lead-in, so the CD 
recorder in subsequent attempts to write 
has no way of knowing where to begin 
writing. It is NOT necessary to close a 
disc in order to read it in a normal CD-
ROM drive.</p>

<h3>Close Session</h3>
<p>When a session is closed, information 
about its contents is written into the disc's 
Table of Contents, and a lead-in is written 
to prepare the disc for a subsequent 
session.</p>

<h3>Cue Sheet</h3>
<p>A list of tracks which will be written one 
after the other in the same session without 
user intervention. Generally used to 
create multi-track audio or mixed-mode 
discs. See the chapter How to Write an 
Audio Disc for details.</p>

<h3>d-characters</h3>
<p>Capital A to Z, digits 0 to 9, and the 
underscore symbol ( _ ).</p>

<h3>Data Area</h3> 
<p>In ISO 9660, the space on a CD-ROM 
where the user data is written. It begins at 
the address 00:02:16.</p>

<h3>Directory</h3>
<p>In the logical format of a disk or disc, a 
"branch" of the information tree 
containing other directories 
(subdirectories) and/or files.</p>

<h3>ECC</h3>
<p>Error Correction Code. A system of 
scrambling data and recording redundant 
data onto disc as it is premastered. On 
playback this redundant information 
helps to detect and correct errors that may 
arise during data transmission.</p>

<h3>EDC</h3>
<p>Error Detection Code. 32 bits in each 
sector which are used to detect errors in 
the sector data.</p>

<h3>Extension</h3>
<p>A small program which can be "plugged 
into" a larger one, usually to enhance the 
main program's capabilities. All 
operating systems use extensions to 
enable them to read compact discs.</p>

<h3>File System</h3>
<p>A data structure that translates the 
physical (sector) view of a disc into a 
logical (files, directories) structure, which 
the application and user can more easily 
use to locate files. See also Logical 
Format.</p>

<h3>Gold Disc</h3>
<p>The recordable disc used in recordable 
CD systems. The blank disc is made of a 
bottom layer of polycarbonate, with a 
preformed track spiral which the 
recording laser follows when inscribing 
information onto the disc. This type of 
disc is therefore also called pre-grooved. 
A translucent layer of recordable material 
is laid on top of the polycarbonate, then a 
reflective layer of gold. On top there are 
thin layers of lacquer and label.</p>

<h3>Header Field</h3>
<p>Four bytes recorded at the beginning of 
each sector which tell the address of the 
sector (expressed as a Logical Block 
Number) and the mode in which the 
sector is recorded.</p>

<h3>HFS</h3>
<p>The file system used by the Macintosh 
operating system to organize data on hard 
and floppy disks. Can also be used for 
CD-ROMs.</p>

<h3>High Sierra Format</h3>
<p>The standard logical format for CD-ROM 
originally proposed by the High Sierra 
Group, on which the ISO 9660 standard 
is based; essentially identical to ISO 
9660.</p>

<h3>Hybrid</h3>
<p>Under the Orange Book standard for 
recordable CD, hybrid means a 
recordable disc on which one or more 
sessions are already recorded, but the disc 
is not closed, leaving space open for 
future recording. However, in popular 
use the term "hybrid" often refers to a 
disc containing both DOS/Windows and 
Macintosh software, which on a 
DOS/Windows platform is seen as a 
normal ISO 9660 disc, while on a Mac it 
appears as an HFS disc.</p>

<h3>ISO 9660 Format</h3>
<p>An international standard specifying the 
logical format for files and directories on 
a CD-ROM.</p>

<h3>ISO 9660 Image</h3>
<p>Or CD-ROM image, image, disc image. 
A single large file which is an exact 
representation of the whole set of data 
and programs as it will appear on a CD, 
in terms of both content and logical 
format.</p>

<h3>Lead-In</h3>
<p>An area at the beginning of each session 
on a recordable compact disc which is left 
blank for the session's Table of Contents 
(track numbers and start-and-stop points). 
The lead-in is written when a session is 
closed, and takes up 4500 sectors on disc 
(1 minute, or roughly 9 megabytes). The 
lead-in also indicates whether the disc is 
multisession, and if the disc is not closed, 
which is the next writeable address on the 
disc.</p>

<h3>Lead-Out</h3>
<p>The area at the end of a session which 
indicates that the end of the data has been 
reached; there is no actual data written in 
the lead-out. The first lead-out on a disc 
is 6750 sectors (1.5 minutes, about 13 
megabytes) long; any subsequent lead-
outs are 2250 sectors (.5 minute, about 4 
megabytes).</p>

<h3>Logical Block</h3>
<p>The smallest addressable space on a disc. 
Each logical block is identified by a 
unique Logical Block Number (LBN), 
assigned in order starting from 0 at the 
beginning of the disc. Under the ISO 
9660 standard, all data on a CD is 
addressed in terms of Logical Block 
Numbers. At present, CD recording is 
supported at one Logical Block per 
logical sector.</p>

<p>Logical Format or Logical Structure
A logical file format such as ISO 9660 
translates the sector-by-sector view of a 
compact disc into a virtual "tree" of 
directories and files, which makes it 
easier for both humans and computers to 
use the information on the disc.</p>

<h3>Mastering</h3>
<p>Technically, refers to the process of 
creating a glass master from which 
compact discs will be reproduced in 
quantity. In desktop recordable CD 
systems, mastering is done together with 
premastering by the desktop CD recorder, 
and the term mastering is used generally 
to mean "recording."</p>

<h3>MSCDEX</h3>
<p>Microsoft DOS extensions for CD-ROM. 
Allows the DOS operating system to 
recognize a CD-ROM as a DOS volume.</p>

<h3>Mixed-Mode Disc</h3>
<p>A compact disc including both computer 
data and CD-DA tracks. The data is all 
contained in Track 1, and the audio in 
one or more following tracks.</p>

<h3>Mount</h3>
<p>To install a compact disc so that the 
computer recognizes its presence and can 
read data from it.</p>

<h3>On-the-Fly</h3>
<p>To write on-the-fly means to write to CD 
data referenced in a virtual image without 
first writing a real ISO 9660 image.</p>

<h3>Orange Book</h3>
<p>The Philips/Sony specification for 
Compact Disc Magneto-Optical (CD-
MO) and Write-Once (CD-WO) systems.</p>

<h3>PCA</h3>
<p>(Power Calibration Area). A space 
reserved at the beginning of the disc for 
calibrating the laser to record to that disc.</p>

<h3>Photo CD</h3>
<p>A compact disc format based on the CD-
ROM XA and Orange Book Hybrid Disc 
specifications, used to store photographic 
images for display and printing.</p>

<h3>PMA</h3>
<p>(Program Memory Area) On a recordable 
disc, an area which "temporarily" 
contains track numbers and their starting 
and stopping points (that is, the session 
Table of Contents) when tracks are 
written in a session which is not yet 
closed. When the session is closed, this 
same TOC information is written in the 
session lead-in.</p>

<h3>Pre-Gap</h3>
<p>A space dividing tracks, recorded before 
the track data area. The length of the pre-
gap varies with the CD recorder and the 
types of tracks. Where successive tracks 
are both of data, one track is separated 
from another by a track pre-gap of 150 
sectors (2 seconds). Where successive 
tracks are of different types, the pre-gap 
is usually of 225 sectors (or three 
seconds). If two successive tracks are 
audio, there may be no pre-gap at all.</p>

<h3>Premastering</h3> 
<p>The process of preparing data to be 
recorded onto a compact disc. This 
includes breaking the data into sectors 
and recording those sectors with the 
appropriate header (address) and error 
correction information. In the case of 
recordable CD systems, premastering and 
mastering are done in one operation, 
resulting in a ready-to-read compact disc.</p>

<h3>Post-Gap</h3>
<p>A space dividing tracks, recorded within 
the track data area at its end. The post-
gap is 150 sectors (2 seconds) long and is 
required only where successive tracks are 
of different types. However, because 
many disc replicators expect a post-gap at 
the end of every track and may 
erroneously strip out data sectors if they 
do not find one, Easy-CD Pro records a 
post-gap after every track.</p>
  
<h3>Red Book</h3>
<p>The Philips/Sony specification for audio 
(CD-DA) compact discs.</p>

<h3>SCSI</h3>
<p>Small Computer System Interface 
(pronounced "scuzzy"). An interface 
which allows up to eight devices to be 
linked to a single controller.</p>

<h3>Sector</h3>
<p>The smallest recordable unit on a CD. A 
disc can contain [(75 sectors per second) 
x (60 seconds per minute) x (number of 
minutes on disc)] sectors. The amount of 
data contained in the sector depends on 
what physical format and mode it is 
recorded in; for "regular" CD-ROM 
(Mode 1) data, you can fit 2048 bytes (2 
kilobytes) of data into a sector.</p>

<h3>Session</h3>
<p>As defined under the Orange Book, a 
recorded segment of compact disc which 
may contain one or more tracks of any 
type (data or audio).</p> 

<h3>Table of Contents (Disc)</h3>
<p>Shows the number of tracks, their starting 
locations, and the total length of the data 
area of the disc.</p>

<h3>Track</h3>
<p>Every time you write to CD, you will 
create at least one track, which is 
preceded by a pre-gap and followed by a 
post-gap. Any session may contain one or 
more tracks, and the tracks within a 
session may be of the same or of different 
types (for example, a mixed-mode disc 
contains data and audio tracks). Using the 
Cue Sheet you can record more than one 
track in a single writing.</p> 

<h3>Virtual Image</h3>
<p>A database of files to be written to CD, 
created by dragging & dropping files into 
the main window. Can be used to write 
directly to CD on-the-fly, or to master a 
real ISO 9660 image to hard disk. See the 
chapter How to Create a Virtual Image 
for details.</p>

<h3>Volume</h3>
<p>Under the ISO 9660 standard, a single 
CD-ROM disc.</p>

<h3>Volume Descriptors</h3>
<p>In ISO 9660, fixed-length records 
containing vital information about the CD 
and how to read it.</p>

<h3>Yellow Book</h3>
<p>The book which sets out the standard 
developed by Philips and Sony for the 
physical format of compact discs to be 
used for information storage.</p>
