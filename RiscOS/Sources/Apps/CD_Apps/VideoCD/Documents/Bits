The Bryan Adams end credits don't even play on the Philips CD-i player,
so not surprising that they don't play on !VideoCD either.
**************************************************************************
According to Dave, Green book is fading out of existance.
**************************************************************************
PAL & NTSC can play on different systems but the quality suffers.
**************************************************************************
PAL has much better colour correction than NTSC (Never The Same Colour
(Twice)).
**************************************************************************
The frame rate for NTSC (c.f. PAL) is different.  It is 50/60 Hz.  The
MPEGfile is encoded for either standard.
**************************************************************************
Info from Stewart:- 
White book (i.e. Video CD in the bottom right corner) cd's tend to have
the following structure.
A CDi directory.
An MPEGAV directory.
A vcd directory (containing an entries.vcd and an info.vcd file).
Green books also tend to have a CDi directory.
**************************************************************************
!M-Code21's !Run file:- Don't run !M-Code21's run file because those
modules (Interlw, MPEGVideo,MPEGAudio,MPEGControl), are already in ROM
(I looked and checked).
Looks like need to set extras with -ntsc and -buffersize though.
**************************************************************************
When testing !VideoCD (launched from !cd), need to test that !cd still
works properly if there's a video cd loaded but no MPEG hardware present.

There is one document on different CD-ROM formats at:
  http://cuiwww.unige.ch/OSG/MultimediaInfo/Info/cd.html

I've seen several others, but I've misplaced the URLS

On a VideoCD disc, the MPEG files must be in the MPEGAV directory. The
MPEG files usually have names like "AVSEQnn.DAT", but not all of the files
with these names are parts of the movie (they also contain the bumper,
FBI warning, etc)-- usually only the largest file(s) are part of the movie.

The MPEG files can be played with VMPEG 1.7.

The .VCD files found in the VCD directory are data files for VideoCD
compatible player programs.  They contain entry point info, etc.

I've never seen an NTSC VideoCD so I don't think I can help.

From a small sample, PAL VideoCDs and CDI discs do, as you say, have a
directory called MPEGAV. The file inside the directory is called AVSEQ01/DAT
on VideoCDs and MUSIC01/DAT on CDI discs.

I have been trying, for quite a long time, to get hold of Green and White
book standards to learn more but I've not been successful. Perhaps those
standards would tell you the difference between PAL and NTSC formats.

The Green Book is available from both Philips and Sony. The Green Book can be
