Introduction
------------

This directory contains the resources and binary components of
NCFresco "V2" that are used in an application or ROM build.

The sources are contained in a separate CVS repository stored at
/home/pelican/cvsroot. Information on the browser is held at
http://intranet/~pelican/

Note the browser is a licensed product and should not be distributed
outside the terms of the license with ANT Ltd.

This document describes the files contained within this directory and
their purpose.

Export paths
------------

A number of different locations are looked at when exporting resources 
either for a ROM (make resources) or application (make install) build.
In order these are.

	<UserIf>.<Locale>
	Common.<Locale>
	<UserIf>.UK
	Common.UK

This is true whether exporting non-translatable resources (such as
Res, Sprites, Config) or ar translatable resources (such as Messages
and templates) except that the appropriate root directory is used in
each case.


Alt resource directory
----------------------

If RES=alt is specified in the components file then the browser
exports a certain number of extra files into a second resource
directory.

Normally in a ROM build the browser copies the following files
to the $.Resources.NCFresco directory.

	Sprites
	Messages
	Res
	Welcome
	MimeMap
	Config
	contents of html directory

If RES=alt is specified then it also copies 

	Sprites
	Messages
	Res

to a directory $.Resources.NCFrescoA. 

The !Boot and !Run files are set up so that the NCFresco main
directory is set to Resources:$.Resources.NCFresco<NCFresco$ExtraRes>
Therefore the main NC boot sequence can determine whether the Alt
directory is used by whether the system variable NCFresco$ExtraRes is
set to A or nothing.

The main NCFresco resource directory is always included on
NCFresco$Path so that the rest of the resources are always available.

The load path for finding the Alt files to be exported is set such
that the Alt subdirectory of each of the locations listed in 'Export
paths' above is examined first for the matching files, followed by the 
usual set of locations.

The resources_alt target in the Makefile can of course be modified to
export other files that need to be Alt specific.


Make target options
-------------------

The following options are supported in the Components file or on the
command line to affect what is exported.

NCFresco:

amu rom_link TYPE=JU
amu rom_link TYPE=JXU
amu rom_link TYPE=U

amu install TYPE=JXU
amu install TYPE=JU
amu install TYPE=U

amu resources RES=alt

On the resource phase of a rom build then the RES=alt option can be
given to instruct the browser to create a second directory in
Resources for an alternate set of resources. This is used in the MPT
build so that there can be a separate Res file when ethernet is being
used. See above for more information on the Alt directory.

HTTP:

amu rom_link TYPE=s
amu rom_link TYPE=sx
amu rom_link

Sprites files
-------------

Note that in a ROM build the sprites come from the Wimp sprite
pool. The only sprites exported from here are the contents of the
SpritesROM file. Therefore the Sprites files themselves are only
included here so that standalone application versions of the different
variants can be generated easily. They shouldn't be relied upon to be
correct as the definitive versions are in the WindowManager directory.
