Queries about nvram_* variables: 
dialwaiting (0-99). This is 0 or 1?
timezone - what about dst etc?
Printer type should be 0-256 (it's CMOS location 0x6b).
Where is disconnect time?

Need to have note - if a checkbox is used, and unchecked, then NCOptiosn
won't know about it. will have to set variable to unchecked value
/before/ the checkbox apperar, so that if checked it will overrde the
default.

Generation of HTML works fine. Setting/reading of CMOS also ok for some
of the nvram_ variables I've implemented.

Now making a module version.

Works. Get 'Exit called' when illegal value is set (eg dial prefix not
in '0-9*#'). Despite Dek_Error2_Init_JumpSig being called in
initialise...

Problems with 'Exit called' due to compiling without -zm, but using
libraries compiled with -zm...
Enabling <input type=hidden...> to have embedded _NCOPTIONS_.

Got the replacement of _NCOPTIONS_foo to work - replaced by value of
variable 'foo', irrespective of where it occurs. Can now embed (for eg)
file_template in template file. Note that this /isn't/ in the functional
spec, which has already been signed off.

Added support for 'nvram__' variables - refer directly to NVRAM tags.

Added code to call RCAIRBlast_ SWIs in response to 'action_*' variables
being set. Seems to work ok - have tested with the preliminary IRBlast
module loaded, and  the module outputs appropriate diagnostics.

At the moment, NCOptions doesn't know how to respond to the following
variables that are in the NCOptions spec:

	nvram_dialtime
	nvram_dialignore
	nvram_tvsource
	action_dial
	action_blastprinter

Version 0.18

Adding MsgTrans stuff...


How to action_blastprinter:

Send Message URLOpen, "NCInt:PrintPage"



MsgTrans seems to work for error messages.


14 Apr 1997

Adding action_blastprinter, send Message URLOpen, "NCInt:PrintPage".

Currently unimplemented nvram variables are:

	nvram_dialtime
	nvram_dialignore
	nvram_tvsource
	action_dial


-- version 0.19 --
