Queries about nvram_* variables: 
dialwaiting (0-99). This is 0 or 1?
timezone - what about dst etc?
Printer type should be 0-256 (it's CMOS location 0x6b).
Where is disconnect time?

Need to have note - if a checkbox is used, and unchecked, then NCOptiosn
won't know about it. will have to set variable to unchecked value
/before/ the checkbox apperar, so that if checked it will overrde the
default.

Generation of HTML works fine. Setting/reading of CMOS also ok for some
of the nvram_ variables I've implemented.

Now making a module version.

Works. Get 'Exit called' when illegal value is set (eg dial prefix not
in '0-9*#'). Despite Dek_Error2_Init_JumpSig being called in
initialise...

Problems with 'Exit called' due to compiling without -zm, but using
libraries compiled with -zm...
Enabling <input type=hidden...> to have embedded _NCOPTIONS=.

Got the replacement of _NCOPTIONS_foo to work - replaced by value of
variable 'foo', irrespective of where it occurs. Can now embed (for eg)
file_template in template file. Note that this /isn't/ in the functional
spec, which has already been signed off.
