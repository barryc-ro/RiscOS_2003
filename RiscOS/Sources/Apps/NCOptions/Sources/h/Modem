/* Example of how dial prefix and call waiting are encoded and stored:
 *
 *	The dial prefix and call waiting strings are each stored in 2 bytes
 *	of NV-RAM. Each digit or '*' or '#' or ',' is stored as a nibble
 *	as follows:
 *
 *	Digit		Value
 *	0-9		1-10 (ie. digit + 1)
 *	'*'		11
 *	'#'		12
 *	','		13
 *	terminator	0
 *
 *	The call waiting string "*70" would be encoded in NV-RAM in bytes
 *	&9B and &9C as follows
 *
 *	Byte		Contents
 *	&9B		&B8 ('*', 7)
 *	&9C		&10 (0, terminator)
 *
 *	The terminator is not required for a full 4 digit value.
 *
 *	The encoded value can be written to and read from NVRAM using
 *	the NVRAM_Write and NVRAM_Read SWIs (in value form, not buffer
 *	form).
