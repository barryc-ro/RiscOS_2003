Notes on the !Meteors source.

!Run: normal run file.  RMEnsures the Meteors module then uses the
 Meteors_Start command.

!Sprites: normal sprite file.

Assemble: TaskObey module to assemble !RunImage from Sources.Meteors.

GenSrc: See R.Meteor2

Sources.MetShapes: derived file produced from R.Meteor2 by GenSrc

MeteorSrc: Loads R.Meteor2 and dislays the objects.  Just seems to
 time the display.  Not used in the proggy?

Notes: This file

R: Appears to contain BBC images...

R.Meteor1: Not used?  6502 meteors program?

R.Meteor2: Used by GenSrc (load'ed into memory) to generate Aasm
 (I jest not) source for the Meteors objects.  This produces the 
 file Sources.MetShapes.

R.Meteors: Not used?  6502 meteors bootstrap program?

ShapeFmt: description of the layout of a meteor object?  Probably
 describes the layout of R.Meteors2.

Sources: ARM Assembler (Aasm) sources.

Sources.Constants: Header file (constants)
Sources.Macros: Header file (macros)
Sources.Meteors: Source file, loads headers from Hdr:, requires Time+Date
Sources.Time+Date: Version number file for !Meteors

Sprites: Sprites file containing ships

Srce6502: BBC basic/assembler source for the 6502 version of meteors,
 except for MetSrc and MetSrc2 which are text file assembler sources.
