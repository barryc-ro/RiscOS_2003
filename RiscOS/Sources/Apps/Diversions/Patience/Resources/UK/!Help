        !Patience version 0.67 (31-Jan-95)
        ==================================

This version of patience has the following features:

* New handling of colours for monochrome mode.

* Finds spritesxx files (sprites, sprites22 and 
  sprites23 provided).

* when "Resign" has been activated, allows the cards
  in the pack to be stepped through one by one.

* "New Pack" allows picture on the card's back can 
  be changed: 4 pictures are provided (more can be 
  added by defining appropriate pictures in the
  sprites, sprites22 and sprites23 files).

* games can be won and a score of played versus won 
  is kept by the game.

* the status of the controls can be saved. The 
  !Config file records the back design, the state 
  of "Only Kings" and "Rev. Cards", plus the number
  of cards turned over at once.

* desktop save links !Patience into the computer's 
  booting process.

* all messages (including menus) in "Messages" file.

There are two controls on the menu which affect how 
the game is played:

"Only Kings" refers to which cards are allowed to be
placed in empty places. The default is that only 
kings may be placed in a hole; when any card can be 
placed the game is dramatically easier.

"Rev. Cards" refers to the process by which cards 
are turned over from the pack to the waste pile. The
default is that cards, selected from the top of
the pack in groups of three, are order reversed 
while being moved from the pack to the waste pile - 
this results in 2/3 of the pack being visible by
running through it twice. The alternative is for no 
reversal - only 1/3 of the pack is visible when 
running through it:- the game gets much harder.
[the interested hacker can change the number of 
cards being moved: its the last parameter in the 
!Config file.]
