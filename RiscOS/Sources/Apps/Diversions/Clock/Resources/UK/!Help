        !Clock version 0.23 (31-Jan-95)
        ===============================

The !Clock application displays a clock face in a
window.

To set the time displayed by the clock use the
!Alarm application.  !Alarm will display a clock
face on the RISC OS icon bar - you may find this
more convenient than a clock in a window.

See the RISC OS 3 Applications Guide for more
information.
