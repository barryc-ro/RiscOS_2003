                      ==========================

This is a desktop version of Blocks. Double clicking on the application will
install its icon on the icon bar. Clicking on the icon will start a new game
and display the game's window.

The object of the game is to score as highly as possible. To score you have
to manoeuvre the tiles which fall from the top such that more tiles can fall.
If a complete line of squares is made across the window, then that line is
knocked out and closed up, making more room for tiles. The scoring is very
simple - one point for each tile. How do you manoeuvre the tiles? That's easy,
you have four controls - left, rotate, right and drop which start off being
the keys 1, 2, 3 and space. Why should you drop a tile - dropping a tile
gives you some bonus thinking time for the following tiles, the more it
dropped the more thinking time.

Not only is !Blocks a game, it's also an executive toy. All you need to do
is select auto and the computer will play the game for you. Have hours of
fun and frustration watching the computer play.

Also on the menu is the 'New game' option, which clears the board and zeros
the score. There is the New keys dialogue box where you click the caret on
the relevant control and press the key you want for that control. And there
is the quit option which removes the !Blocks icon from the icon bar.
