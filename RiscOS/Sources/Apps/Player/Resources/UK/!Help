                        !Player
                        =======

The !Player application provides a playback facility for a wide range of
digital sample types and sample rates. Sample types include Acorn Replay,
Audioworks, and WAV. It understands ADPCM, 8 bit linear and mu-law, and 16
bit formats.

To run a file, drop it onto !Player (note that double clicking on a sound
file will not load it into !Player). !Player will try to set the parameters
for playing using information from the file.
