ChangeFSI is a useful program for converting and displaying image files of
various formats. These images can then be converted into sprites or JPEGs
for viewing with RISC OS applications such as !Paint and !Draw. (Note that
versions of !Paint and !Draw supplied with RISC OS 3.5 and earlier cannot
import JPEG files.)

You should make sure that your conversion and subsequent use of an image
does not infringe on any copyright that the image may be under.

More complete help on ChangeFSI is available from text files held within the
