Use: ChangeFSI <in file> <out file> <mode>[cdtp] [<n>:<n> [<n>:<n>]] [options]
Changes source picture to output sprite in specified mode, with suffix:
c
  1 bit modes: use clustered dithering with 4x4 cell
  2 bit modes: use the four colours "black", "cyan", "magenta" and "yellow"
d
  1 bit modes: use clustered dithering with 2x2 cell
  4 bit modes: use 1 bit red, 1 bit green, 1 bit blue
  8 bit modes: 256 level grey scale
t
  1 bit modes: use clustered dithering with 3x3 cell
  4 bit modes: 16 level grey scale
r
  2 bit modes: Devious colour matching algorithm
  4 bit modes: Devious colour matching algorithm
  8 bit modes: Devious colour matching algorithm
-no suffix-
  1 bit modes: b/w dispersed dot dithering
  2 bit modes: 4 level grey scale
  4 bit modes: 8 level grey scale
  8 bit modes: John Bowler's colour matching algorithm
               (defaults to 'r' mode if not VIDC1 compatible)
(see FSIinfo for more information on suffix)
The pixel size is corrected for and the default is output of the same size as
the input. Size ratios are output:input or = for scale to output size.
Mode 'AIM' writes an AIM format output file.
Mode 'p15' writes a p15 file.
Modes 'p1' to 'p6' write PBM files.
Mode 'JPEG' writes a JPEG format output file.
-equal    performs histogram equalisation.
-hflip, -vflip    present the picture left/right reversed / upside down.
-rotate   +90 degree rotation of the image.
-rotate-  -90 degree rotation of the image.
-info     gives details of the source image.
-invert   inverts the colour range of the input image.
-noscale  disables automatic pixel size correction.
-nosize   disables automatic pixel size correction for input pixels only.
-range    expands the input's dynamic range to full scale.
-sharpen  digitally sharpens the picture, -sharpen<n> overrides the default
          of 24: range 8(harsh)-31(soft).
-brighten brightens the entire image (caution: may saturate hues to white)
-gamma    applies gamma correction, -gamma<n> overrides the default of 2.2
-nodither prevents the error diffusion dithering.
-black    corrects for black inked spots larger than square pixels, -black<n>
          overrides the default of 32: range 0(not at all)-128(harsh)
-red<r>, -green<r>, -blue<r> allow the red, green, blue weights for monochrome
          luminance to be changed from their CIE defaults of 0.299, 0.587, 0.114.
-max<n>   maximum size of output image before output to disc.
Modes S16 and S32 write 16 and 32 bit per pixel sprites, with X and Y pixels
per inch specified as comma seperated values (e.g. S16,90,90)
