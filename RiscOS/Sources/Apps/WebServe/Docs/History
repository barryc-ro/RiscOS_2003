Change Log:
===========


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.08 Tue 06-Feb-96        Richard Manby                 

Added to SrcFiler tree.

Previous version log (imported from ChangeLog file by sbrodie, 12/1/98)

0.08 06-Feb-1996 Two minute timeout added to processes.

0.07 02-Feb-1996 URL censorship added. Connect to !MailServ call issued each time
                 a URL is fetched remotely.

                 Major restructure of remote/local data fetch and dispatch code
                 needed to allow neat implementation of censorship!.

                 THIS VERSION IS LIKELY TO BE LESS RELIABLE THAN 0.06!

0.06 26-Jan-1996 Local serving of pages. Sockets openned as re-usable.

0.05 18-Jan-1996 Connects to !MailServ. Displays max cache size. Changes iconbar icon
                 on successful connection.
 
0.04 17-Jan-1996 Reads/writes !Config file.
                 Connects automatically on startup if !Config file contains valid data.

0.03 17-Jan-1996 Expire implemented.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.09 Fri 09-Feb-96        Richard Manby                 

0.09 09-Feb-1996 Write changed CacheIndex files out every (n) minutes - to retain
                 most of the cache if the machine/proxy crashes.
                 Deletes expired files and if necessary old hosts when cache size
                 exceeds limits.
                 If !CacheRoot hasn't been 'seen', we set Httpd$CacheRoot and
                 Httpd$ServeRoot assuming that !CacheRoot lives in our parent
                 directory.
                 If !MailServ not running, or goes AWOL, user is sent an appropriate
                 page.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.10 Wed 14-Feb-96        Richard Manby                 

0.10 14-Feb-1996 Process timeout will now kill the process cleanly, decrementing
                 its usage count (and deleteing the cache entry if it was being
                 filled).
                 We now reset the connection timeout when transfering long files.
                 Status window now shows host name correctly.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.11 Tue 27-Feb-96        Richard Manby                 

This test only version has not logged into the source filer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.12 Tue 27-Feb-96        Richard Manby                 

0.12 27-Feb-1996 Flush junk from !CacheRoot.Cache completed.
                 !Run file changed to RMEnsure modules from System:Modules.Network.URL
                 directory.
                 This version has the LF/CR/LF kludge.
                 If request doesn't contain the user name, use 'Alien' for censorship
                 checking.

0.11 21-Feb-1996 Generation of logfiles by free_process_record removed (it was
                 a debugging aid).
                 Generation of ServeIndex file switched off (a debugging aid).
                 Nine-tenths of 'flush junk from !CacheRoot.Cache implemented.
                 For testing, don't issue ResetTimer commands to !MailServ.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.13 Fri 01-Mar-96        Richard Manby                 

0.13 01-Mar-1996 Quick fix to make locally served pages and error pages work again,
                 ie generate an HTML header for them.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.14 Thu 07-Mar-96        Richard Manby                 

0.14 07-Mar-1996 Better generation of headers for local pages.
                 Error pages held in Errors directory rather than Serve directory.
                 Should correctly send cached data even when sockets won't take
                 blocks as large as we would like.
                 Bug fix the 'Alien' user.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.15 Wed 20-Mar-96        Richard Manby                 

0.15 19-Mar-1996 Reinstate issueing of ResetTimer commands to !MailServ.
                 Slight tweek to startup 'flush junk code'. Clears Hosts that
                 have with no cached data associated.
                 Server maps URL's ending in ".../" onto ".../Home".

0.18 27-Mar-1996 New Connect-dailup code.
                 Make the status dbox fields flicker-free.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.19 Fri 29-Mar-96        Richard Manby                 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.20 Fri 29-Mar-96        Richard Manby                 

0.20 28-Mar-1996 Names changed to !WebServe (was !HTTPD) and !WebCache (!CacheRoot).
                 New sprites.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.21 Wed 24-Apr-96        Richard Manby                 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.22 Wed 24-Apr-96        Richard Manby                 

0.22 04-Apr-1996 Bug fix the 'Port' menu so that selecting an entry copies its value
                 into the 'Local port' field of the Config dbox.
                 The connected/not-connected field has been removed from the Status
                 dbox - this really ment 'listening on the local port' or not. The
                 not-listening state is now show by greying out the iconbar icon.

0.21 02-Apr-1996 Changes to support POST request.
                 Another change to the sprites.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.23 Fri 03-May-96        Richard Manby                 

0.23 03-May-1996 Fix the Alien user - silly code omision when restructuring for POST requests.
                 An expiry time of zero days received from !MailServ is now taken to mean one hour.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.24 Fri 24-May-96        Richard Manby                 

0.24 22-May-1999 Truncate overlong URL's to 200bytes (199chars+term) before sending to
                 !MailServe for censorship checks. Since !MailServe limits its censorship
                 URL's to 40 chars, this seems reasonable. Obviously we can only match
                 with wildcarded URL's held by !MailServe.
                 Also truncate usernames sent to !MailServe to 20bytes (19chars+term).
                 The censorship reply is now matched to the sending process using the
                 message.your_ref field rather than URL and user name lookup.
                 We can't do this for expiry times, overlong URLs default to 1 minute.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.25 Fri 21-Jun-96        Richard Manby                 

Not logged in.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.26 Fri 21-Jun-96        Richard Manby                 

0.26 04-Jun-1996 Change the URL_SetProxy, as it caused problems when running WebServe
                 locally.

0.25 24-May-1996 Tweek call to URL_SetProxy so ftp: is proxyed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.27 Fri 14-Nov-97        Stewart Brodie                

Basically this is version 0.26 but with massive tidying up to the source code
and a few serious bugs fixed (missing semicolons, wrong number of parameters
passed to functions, failing to parse dates properly).  This version uses
more restrictive compilation options and compiles cleanly with them[1].  All
non-static function declarations are in .h files and no variable declarations
are declared in .h files. The compiler no longer requires the "-pcc" option
which was previously used to get around syntax errors in the sources.

This version brings all the resources that were inserted into !WebCache and
!WebServe resource files for the Acorn World 1997 beta release into a
checked-in version for the first time.  The !Run file has been brought up to
date to require the latest fetchers.

It is the intention to continue by re-introducing the numerous "quick little
hacks for project XYZ" into a single controlled version to halt continuing
divergence.  This has NOT happened at this stage though.

This version contains no performance enhancements (unless you count removing
a few random memory writes as performance enhancements!)

[1] If you get lots of silly warnings about left shifts, then edit
TCPIPLibs:sys.h.types and alter the defitions of FD_SET, FD_CLR and FD_ISSET
to use 1UL instead of 1 towards the end of their respective definitions. 
This is the compiler being overly picky (although technically correct)


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.28 Wed 19-Nov-97        Stewart Brodie                

Internal beta release - see 0.29 for changes (when I upload it)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.29 Wed 19-Nov-97        Stewart Brodie                

Intended for Expresso development release (20/11/97).

Enforces the Maximum Connections limit.
Major performance improvement in data delivery to clients.
Configuration option to operate independently from Connect.
Many minor bug fixes to aid stability.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.30 Wed 26-Nov-97        Stewart Brodie                

File seeking optimisations backed out (cures No stack for trap
handler errors and many truncated object problems).  Other minor
cacheing errors corrected.

HTTP header parser imported from HTTP module, so at least it can now
parse headers reliably.

Status window gadgets no longer continually updated when Status
window is not open.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.31 Mon 01-Dec-97        Stewart Brodie                

File seeking optimisations re-introduced with bug fix to cure earlier
problems (NSfTH faults were being caused by fwrite then fread (or vice versa)
without an intervening fseek - which is undefined behaviour :-( )

Fast buffering added which optimises serving from disc files a lot. (We send
as much data as possible to the client, filling the socket buffer as far as
possible, and do not limit the per-Wimp_Poll data transferred to
whatever arbitrary limit is present in the source code - was 1024, now 4096)

Product token name and version number taken only from Messages file (Res
file ProgInfo version overridden by contents of Messages).

Avoids duplicating headers unnecessarily.  Headers parsed more intelligently,
and URL parsing is less error-prone.

Now works with Fresco and ArcWeb reliably (it was easily confused by 
conditional and partial requests).


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.32 Tue 02-Dec-97        Stewart Brodie                

Cache status now represented by a slider gadget in the status window which
gives a more user-friendly cache fullness indication.

Cache size limit is more rigourously enforced.

!Run file updated to ensure inet$mimemappings is set.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.33 Thu 04-Dec-97        Stewart Brodie                

Many fixes.  All visible status window text and configuration window text
can be internationalised by altering the Res and Messages files only (no
changes required to the binary).

Now responses to Wimp_MAppControl/Configuration message.

Has option to have icon on icon bar or not, plus if WebServe is run twice,
it just opens the configuration window of the already present !WebServe (so
if the icon bar icon is switched off, you can still get at the configuration
without the browser opening it.

Fixes to error system - more reliably reported, plus the dynamically generated
error pages can be used.

New form of data serving introduced (PROC_WRITE_FROMBUFFER) which allows you
to create responses into a buffer and write them to the client in a multi-
tasking manner.  Used by the dynamic error message code to report SWI errors
on URL module SWI calls.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.34 Fri 05-Dec-97        Stewart Brodie                

POST forms now work.  Images are no longer truncated.  No longer attempts to
start dialling.

Typically, these all turned up 1 hour after doing an external release yesterday,
but they do seem to be stable in today's version.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.35 Mon 08-Dec-97        Stewart Brodie                

Found the bug that caused truncation of transferred objects.  A shutdown was
being performed on the client's data socket.  This is now fixed.  The exhaustion
of Mbufs has also been alleviated by forcibly reducing the send buffer size
of a socket on the loopback interface to 4096 bytes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.36 Mon 08-Dec-97        Stewart Brodie                

Problem regarding truncation of files served from the cache solved.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.37 Mon 15-Dec-97        Stewart Brodie                

Proxy loop detection code added - prevents infinite loops of requests
(provided all the versions of WebServe involved are 0.37 or greater).

This version also has an option to accept only loopback connections.
This is useful for single users who don't want other people using 
their machine as a proxy, which older versions of WebServe are quite
happy to do.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.38 Wed 17-Dec-97        Stewart Brodie                

Now knows about all the defined fetch methods, plus is very much more
careful about not multiply deregistering URL sessions.
Specific release for December 18 development release.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.40 Wed 28-Jan-98        Stewart Brodie                

Version 0.39 was an intermediate test version and never released.

Many minor fixes, URL parsing code now uses URL module's routines for parsing
URLs and as such now works far more reliably.  Ability to set cache
location added.  

The comment for version 0.37 regarding detection of loops is wrong.  It should
read "if *any* of the versions ...".

All of this code expects to sit in !BOOT.Resources in a universal boot sequence.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.41 Fri 30-Jan-98        Stewart Brodie                

Don't ask !Connect for the size of the web cache.

**** NOW MIGRATING TO CVS: IT'S ON THE RENAISSANCE TRUNK IN
**** RiscOS/Sources/Apps/WebServe

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.42 Thu 12-Feb-98        Stewart Brodie                

Ignore all cache size messages from other applications.

Fixes the "Proxy loop configuration detected" on requests to "localhost"
instead of the real hostname of the machine

Resource file tweaked so that it looks OK in system font and doesn't
have bits clipped off the edge of windows.

Buttons laid out more aesthetically pleasingly.

Build structure reorganised to remove dependency on !Make.  !Mk and !MkClean
TaskObey scripts added to build distributions to an Export subdirectory.

Resources split into common application components and language specific
resources to make internationalisation easier.
