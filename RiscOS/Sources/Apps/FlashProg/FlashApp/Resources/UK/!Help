Flash manager program
=====================

All pretty obvious. Buttons do the following:
 Power on - powers on the Flash and reads details and does a quick size check
 Power off - powers off the Flash so you can remove it
 Write... - writes a file into the flash, drag a file to the window which appears
 Verify... - verifies a file against the content of the flash
 Save... - saves the contents of the flash
 Erase... - erases the flash
 Check carefully - does a more detailed check for size
 Erase before write - will force an erase before the next write
 Verify after write - will verify after a write has completed

The Lo/Hi halfwords buttons will turn on if the
device you are using is 16-bit wide.
If so:
 Write... - will write the relevant half of the file
 Verify... - will verify against the relevant half of the file
 Save... - will overwrite only one half of the file
The file is interleaved correctly so a single file
will work with either two 16-bit wide or 1 32-bit wide flash

In the unlikey event of using an 8-bit wide device
use an ADJUST click on Write/Verify/Save buttons to access the odd bytes
(The window title will show e.g. Write from+1 as a visual check)
