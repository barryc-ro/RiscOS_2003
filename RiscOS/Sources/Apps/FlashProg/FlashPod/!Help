		FlashPod - Acorn Podule Flash Memory Utility
		--------------------------------------------
		
This is a utility to program, erase, dump or verify the flash memory
device in an Acorn Podule card.  It is written for the AMD 29F family of
flash memory devices as used on the current generation of NC network cards.
However, the code is structured to allow support for additional devices to
be added easily.

Instructions for use
--------------------
Place the expansion card to be programmed in a Podule slot of a RISC PC or
NC.  The application expects the card to be in Podule slot 0 by default
(i.e. the bottom slot on a RISC PC, and the only slot on an NC), but this
can be overridden with the '-s <slotno>' switch.

The command line syntax is:

   flashpod [-s <slotno>] [-v] [-e] [-r | -p] [<filename>]
   
The arguments are as follows:

   <filename>
	The path of a disk file containing the image to be programmed or
	verified (-p and -v options), or to save the flash image in (-r).
	   	
   -s <slotno> 
   	Use podule slot <slotno> instead of the default (0)

   -r
   	Read the flash device and save the image in <filename>
   	
   -e
   	Erase the flash device (before programming it if -p also set)   	

   -p
   	Program the flash device with the image in <filename>
   	
   -v
   	Verify that the flash device has the same image as in <filemame>
   	(after programming if -p also set)

The '-e', '-p', and '-v' flags can be used alone or in combination to
erase, program and verify the device in one invocation.
   	
The '-r' flag can be used alone or in combination with the '-e' flag to save
the current image and then erase the device.  The '-r' flag cannot be combined
with '-p' or '-v' because only a single filename argument is permitted.

If none of '-e', '-p', '-v' and '-r' are specified the program simply displays
information about the flash device in the podule slot.

Examples
--------
Both of the following commands erase, program and verify the flash device
in podule slot 0 with the image in file 'ISDN/028':

    flashpod -e -p -v ISDN/028
    flashpod -s 0 -e -p -v ISDN/028

The following command erases the flash devices in podule slot 1:

    flashpod -s 1 -e
 
The following command reads the image from the flash device in podule slot 0
and saves it in file 'Image0'.

    flashpod -r Image0

The following commands both report information about the flash device in 
podule slot 0:

    flashpod
    flashpod -s 0
