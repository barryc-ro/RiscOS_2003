FAULT REPORTING   

Application Name: !PAINT

Application Version Number: 

Exact Hardware Configuration: 2Mb A5000

ROM Version Number: 2.20c (release)

Tester Name: TSumner

Test Number: tsb663

Fault Number:

Priority:   Urgent

Summary: rotate sprite stiffs machine

Date Encountered:  30/9/91

Test and Fault Description:

rotating a sprite > about 43k by any that is not a multiple
of 90 degrees stiffs the machine. Sometimes the bottom of the
screen display is shifted up about an inch and replaced by black,
sometimes the screen display is replaced by vertical bars or stripes,
sometimes the machine just freezes, even the keyboard interrupts.
This seems to be dependent on the size of the sprite and the
ram in the machine. in a 2mb machine, about 45k is large enough,
in a 4Mb machine the a 138k sprite is sometimes ok. This can
also generate an error box with "wimpt1" in it. Sometimes ctrl-reset
is not enough to reset machine.
