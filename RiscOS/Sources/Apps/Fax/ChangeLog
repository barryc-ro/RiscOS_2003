Changed to the NSF codes allocated by the DTI's representative,
Alan PUGH (tel. 0118 9210909): country code 0xb4, country subcode 0x00,
manufacturer code 0xb6, where the convention used is that the bits
are transmitted starting with the least significant bit of the octets
as given.  Note this means prior versions of !Fax will not detect or
be detected by this version of !Fax.

PAN-00754
PAN-00667
Tweaked transit timings a bit more (lengthen pre-T.4 silence by 10 ms).

PAN-01364
Changed the page chop overflow tolerance to 3%.

PAN-01686
Allowed DCS to be followed by DIS when transmitting when the DCS was
caused by RTP, RTN or EOMthenMCF, such that the receiver's capabilities
are allowed to change during a transmission.

PAN-01686
Allowed clients such as !Daytona to request a halving of the datarate,
when receiving, where possible; this allows clients to try to stem
an incoming datarate they can't cope with because e.g. the outgoing
datarate is lower.
