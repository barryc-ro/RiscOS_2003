Before checking in anything:

- Run !MkClnAll
- Remove dynamic dependencies from Makefile and FaxSupport.Makefile
- Make sure version info is up-to-date in Resources.UK.Messages and
  FaxSupport.cmhg.cmhg (both should have the same number)

Checking in:

- Commit it all, giving a suitable change log, e.g.:
  cvs commit -F ~/log Fax
- Tag the whole lot with the component and version number, e.g.:
  cvs tag -R mrison_fax-x_xx Fax
- If you really need to make a change to an already checked-in
  version without incrementing the version number, you'll need to
  untag and retag

After building:

- The Res file in Targets.!Fax is not needed for non-debug builds
- The !Sprites* files in Targets.!Fax are not needed for non-desktop builds
- Use stackinfo or something to set the WimpSlot in Targets.!Fax.!Run
