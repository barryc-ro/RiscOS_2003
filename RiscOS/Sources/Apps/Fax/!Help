Before checking in anything:

- Run !MkClnAll
- Remove dynamic dependencies from !Fax and FaxSupport Makefiles

Checking in the final version:

- Update Messages file in Resources.UK to set final version (no d)
- Update cmhg file in FaxSupport.cmhg to set same version (no d either)
- Commit it all, giving a suitable comment, e.g.:
  cvs commit -m "Finalised version 0.13 for Daytona AppFlash 0.17" Fax
- Tag the whole lot with the component and version number, e.g.:
  cvs tag -R mrison_fax_013 Fax

After building:

- The Res file in Targets.!Fax is not needed for non-debug builds
- The !Sprites* files in Targets.!Fax are not needed for non-desktop builds
- Use stackinfo or something to set the WimpSlot in Targets.!Fax.!Run
