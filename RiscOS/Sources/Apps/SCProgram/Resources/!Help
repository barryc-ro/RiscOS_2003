| Help file for !SCProgram

Command files
-------------

The program should be called with the syntax :

    !SCProgram <cmd file>

where <cmd file> is a text file containing lines of commands. If the command
file is ommitted, scprogram will enter an interactive mode allowing commands
to be entered on a command line.

The following commands can all appear in command files or can be entered using
the interactive mode.

Comments
--------

  |

  Lines starting with the character '|' are treated as comments and ignored.

Write
-----

  write <filename> <scfilename>

  This will take the file <filename> and write it to the smart card file
  <scfilename>.

Read
----

  read <filename> <scfilename>

  This will read data from the smart card file <scfilename> and write it into
  a file <filename>

Dump
----

  dump <scfilename>

  This will read data from the smart card file <scfilename> and display it
  on screen using the conventional hex/ascii screen format. The file size
  is also displayed before the file data.

Code
----

  code <chv code number>

  This will allow the program to remember a password for later submission
  during reads and writes.

Display
-------

  display <text to be displayed>

  This will write the specified text to the screen. It is useful for providing
  progress information.

Wait
----

  wait

  This will display the message "press a key..." and wait until a key is
  pressed. It might be used to prompt between swapping cards.

chv
---

  chv <enable|disable>

  This will either enable or disable the checking of chv codes for protected
  file access. The syntax of this command has changed between version 2.01
  and the current version. The correct CHV code must have been entered first
  using the 'code' command.

Unblock
-------

  unblock <unblock code> <new ch1 code>

  This allows the unblocking of a previously blocked card following a number
  of incorrect attempts at chv1. The chv1 code can be set to a new value during
  this process. Note that cards with serial numbers 0->750 have unblock codes
  which cannot be typed in using ASCII characters, thus this command cannot be
  used.

Help
----

  help [<command name>]

  This will provide a list of all commands available or the syntax of a specific
  command if specified.

Quit
----

  This will stop command processing and exit the application.
