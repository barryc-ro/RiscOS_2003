          !Chars version 1.18 (15-Sep-94)
          ===============================

The Chars application helps you to enter characters
that are not available on the keyboard; for example
accented characters or special symbols.

To start Chars, double-click on its icon.  A window
will appear showing all the characters currently
available.

To enter a character, position the mouse pointer over
it and click SELECT (or press the SHIFT key).  The
character will be entered at the caret position as if
it had been typed.

Use of the SHIFT key is suggested if you are trying to
enter text into a writeable icon inside a menu, as
clicking SELECT will cause the menu to disappear.

If you wish to see the characters in a different font,
click MENU over the window.
