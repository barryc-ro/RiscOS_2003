Copy of !Help file from !Chars version 0.14 (19 Apr 1989)


This application displays the character set in a window. The user can click
SELECT on a character to enter that character as if from the keyboard.
Different "fancy fonts" can be selected with the menu: unlike the default
display, only the characters in the font will be shown. The top row of
characters, shown in inverse video with the System Font only, correspond to
control characters (eg clicking on the inverse video L is the same as typing
ctrl-L ie character 12).

An extra facility is provided for entering characters into a menu item. Because
clicking in another window would close any existing menu tree, !Chars allows
you to press the Shift key while the pointer is over a character in its window,
which has the same effect as clicking SELECT on the character, but does not
close any menus.
