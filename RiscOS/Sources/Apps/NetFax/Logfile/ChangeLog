Whenever the logfile clears and the logfile screen was currently open, it now
---===***ALWAYS***===--- returns to the home screen.

Fixed a smal cosmetic fault. Last version of Logfile didn't give the:
'The log has been cleared.'
message once the log has been purged. This has now been rectified.

The way that the log is purged has now been altered to the following:

Type of Purge:
  1) Daytona is currently showing the Log screen
     If the logfile has been manually purged, then the log is cleared and the
     user is taken back to the main Daytona home screen.
     If the logfile has been purged due to a timed purge, then the log is
     cleared and the user is taken back to the main Daytona home screen.
     
  2) Daytona is not currently showing the Log screen
     When the logfile has been purged due to a timed purge, then the log
     itself is purged but the currently displayed screen is not altered.
     This becomes, in effect, a 'silent' purge.

Major memory leaks have been limited, so it shouldn't cause the Daytona to 
halt because of it. Also commenting and tidyup's 90% complete.
