Implemented SQ_LX_SLOW_INCOMING & PQ_RX_SLOW_INCOMING to slow fax reception
when memory nearly full.

Daytona version numbers changed to 0.62.

SendQ.c QueueWalker now prints a report to the local fax machine if unable
to deliver a fax/enote.
Fixes PAN-01746 & PAN-00845

===============================================================================
Version:	0.60
Date:		1998-05-08
Name:		Nick Evans
CVS tag:	nicke_Daytona-0_60

Small change to buildflags to allow the Daytona/Laguna build switch to be
doe by the makefile.  The Laguna Makefile now defines the Laguna Flag 
which does the switch.  If this is not present you just get a standard 
Daytona build.

Daytona version numbers changed to 0.60.


================================================================================
Version:	0.59
Date:		1998-05-08
Name:		Simon Forrest
CVS tag:	sforrest_Daytona-0_59

Fixed the animation slideshow functionality (PAN-01728); only trivial changes
were required.  Just noticed that this fault has been removed from the
database....it's fixed anyway!

Daytona version numbers changed to 0.59.


================================================================================
Version:	0.58
Date:		1998-05-07
Name:		Ben Laughton
CVS tag:	blaughto_Daytona-0_58

Fixed a careless bug introduced by the new email code that caused aborts
to happen if you connected to an empty mailbox.

Daytona version numbers changed to 0.58.


================================================================================
Version:	0.57
Date:		1998-05-07
Name:		Simon Forrest
CVS tag:	sforrest_Daytona-0_57

Some slight changes to get Daytona to build from the current sources; the
previous version had some dubious #defines in some funny places, plus the
Daytona build flag (in BuildFlags.h) was set to zero.


================================================================================
Version:	0.56
Date:		1998-05-06
Name:		Nick Evans
CVS tag:	nicke_Daytona-0_56

Some trivial changes to get Laguna to build from the current sources.


================================================================================
Version:	0.55
Date:		1998-05-06
Name:		Ben Laughton
CVS tag:	blaughton_Daytona-0_55

Significant re-work of the email receive code:
 * Should fix problems with cover sheets for large documents involving multiple
   download sessions (PAN-01772).
 * Missing page reports now work (PAN-01193).
 * Messages will not be deleted from the server until they have been printed
   (PAN-01673).
 * Daytona will automatically re-dial if it left messages on the server that
   it could no download (once the PrintQ is empty).

Changed ZModem hangup script to (hopefully) cure the hangup-after-ZModem
problems once and for all.  Added a more TIMEOUTs to the remote answer
script and also an ATZ. 

Daytona version numbers changed to 0.55.


================================================================================
Version:	0.54
Date:		1998-05-06
Name:		Simon Forrest
CVS tag:	sforrest_Daytona-0_54

Message file alteration made to fix PAN-01894.

Daytona version numbers changed to 0.54.


================================================================================
Version:	0.53
Date:		1998-05-06
Name:		Richard Manby
CVS tag:	rmanby_Daytona-0_53

Code required for 'PAN-01770 Fails to reconnect to ISP'
Partially complete Email downloads that are abandoned due to lack of space
can now request a resumption of the download when the PrintQ empties.
To prevent interleaving of incoming direct fax/zmodem calls with partially
downloaded email, incoming calls are ignored after the download is restarted.
N.B. Requires BLaughtons new email receive code to do this.

MimeQ now defines ENTITY_LIST_SIZE of 20 rather than 3.

PAN-01744 Infinite retries if call fails after connection
Now counts failures after connection, aborts document if too many failures.

Daytona version numbers changed to 0.53.


================================================================================
Version:	0.52
Date:		1998-05-05
Name:		Richard Manby
CVS tag:	rmanby_Daytona-0_52

Intermediate drop. Messages needed for BLaughtons email receive code.


================================================================================
Version:	0.51
Date:		1998-04-30
Name:		Nick Evans
CVS tag:	nicke_Daytona-0_51

If a fax cannot be sent Laguna prints the first page of the fax along with the
error message.


================================================================================
Version:	0.50
Date:		1998-04-28
Name:		Nick Evans
CVS tag:	nicke_Daytona-0_50

Got rid of compiler warnings in T-Fax build.


================================================================================
Version:	0.49
Date:		1998-04-28
Name:		Richard Manby
CVS tag:	rmanby_Daytona-0_49

Fixed PAN-01708: Page not found errors when SendQ reconnects to recipient during
a streaming send.

Better MimeEncoder space tracking. Should fix some of the 'NFELib error -4'
problems.


================================================================================
Version:	0.48
Date:		1998-04-21
Name:		Nick Evans
CVS tag:	<None, it was forgotten!>

More conditional compilation wrappers added to make compilation of T-Fax
code easier.


================================================================================
Version:	0.47
Date:		1998-04-21
Name:		Richard Manby
CVS tag:	rmanby_Daytona-0_47

ZModem send now terminates at hiPage rather than file not found, which may be
cleaner.  Done by sending a non-existant file name "<document dir>.Stop".

Various conditional compilation wrappers added to make compilation of T-Fax
code easier.


================================================================================
Version:	0.46
Date:		1998-04-07
Name:		Richard Manby
CVS tag:	rmanby_Daytona-0_46

Fixed PAN-01725 User sets retries (as per spec) rather than total number of
dialups (though internally we convert from retries to dialups).

Preliminary work for PAN-01755 (Validate configuration before allowing fax/email
operation)

Type mismatch between !Setup and !Daytona's view of external_access_pausewait
and international_access_pausewait fixed. !Setup passes the string to use rather
than a number.

Added extra fax error message texts to messages file

Also the Version strings in both the Messages file and Resource file have been
updated to V0.46, dated 07-Apr-1998.


================================================================================
Version:	0.45
Date:		1998-04-06
Name:		Ben Laughton
CVS tag:	blaughto_Daytona-0_45

Fixed some bugs that were affecting 'complicated' email downloads.  eg.
Mailboxes with quite large multi-page documents where only part of
document may be downloaded.  The effects that these had could have been
many and varied depending on the individual mailbox, but in general:

* 'Acorn POP3 null address' errors should no longer occur as described in
   PAN-01773.

* In cases where Daytona only downloads part of a mailbox (possibly
  splitting a document in the process) it should download messages in a
  sensible order: before it may have done odd things like leave a single
  page out of a document and print it at the end.  This doesn't fix a specific
  fault report, but would alter the sequence of events desribed in:
  PAN-01769 to PAN-01773 (unfortunatley by the time you do what's described
  in PAN-01770 things have gone wrong to the extent where any further behaviour
  will be unpredictable).


================================================================================
Version:	0.44
Date:		1998-04-03
Name:		Richard Manby
CVS tag:	rmanby_Daytona-0_44

Dialling in data mode, finding a fax machine now reports:
  "Connection failed, retrying in fax mode"

Low level ZModem error messages now show the error number rather than
  "ZModem error (0x%.2x)"

Fixed PAN-01748 Memory leak creating email message.

Also the Version strings in both the Messages file and Resource file have been
updated to V0.44, dated 03-Apr-1998.


================================================================================
Version:	0.43
Date:		1998-04-02
Name:		Simon Forrest
CVS tag:	sforrest_Daytona-0_43

Basically a user-interface message tidy up, for example, ensuring consistency
of use of words such as "Email" and capilisation throughout.  A number of
minor code alterations were required to "SendQ.c", "Screen.h" and "Screen.c"
in order to fix the following faults:

	PAN-00909
	PAN-01295
	PAN-01357

But mostly the Messages file has been altered to include more generic terms,
for example, replacing "Fax to..." with "Sending direct to...", etc.

Also the Version strings in both the Messages file and Resource file have been
updated to V0.43, dated 02-Apr-1998.


================================================================================
Version:	0.42
Date:		1998-03-26
Name:		Richard Manby & Ben Laughton
CVS tag:	blaughto_Daytona-0_42

Daytona now copes with email messages being deleted behind its back. 
Also copes with POP3 servers that lie about the size of messages.  Fixed
bug in email retrieval not freeing resources at a certain point.

Fix for PAN-01713
When Daytona dials expecting to find another Daytona but finds a fax machine
(dialler reports no carrier or timeout) we retry in fax mode. The retry is
now immediate rather than after 30 seconds.

Error box now used sprite "confirm_1" rather than "decide_0" ie ! instead of ?

Better internal error message passing.

Now searches the application messages file for user friendy messages rather
than just showing error numbers. Only a small number of messages at present.

Redial delays now closer to TLFS:
  No dialtone - retries after 5 minutes.
  Line busy   - first retry after 30 seconds, then every 5 minutes
These will be revised later.
