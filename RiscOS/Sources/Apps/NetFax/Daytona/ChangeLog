Fixed some bugs that were affecting 'complicated' email downloads.  eg.
Mailboxes with quite large multi-page documents where only part of
document may be downloaded.  The effects that these had could have been
many and varied depending on the individual mailbox, but in general:

* 'Acorn POP3 null address' errors should no longer occur as described in
   PAN-01773.

* In cases where Daytona only downloads part of a mailbox (possibly
  splitting a document in the process) it should download messages in a
  sensible order: before it may have done odd things like leave a single
  page out of a document and print it at the end.  This doesn't fix a specific
  fault report, but would alter the sequence of events desribed in:
  PAN-01769 to PAN-01773 (unfortunatley by the time you do what's described
  in PAN-01770 things have gone wrong to the extent where any further behaviour
  will be unpredictable).

================================================================================

Daytona now copes with email messages being deleted behind its back. 
Also copes with POP3 servers that lie about the size of messages.  Fixed
bug in email retrieval not freeing resources at a certain point.

Fix for PAN-01713
When Daytona dials expecting to find another Daytona but finds a fax machine
(dialler reports no carrier or timeout) we retry in fax mode. The retry is
now immediate rather than after 30 seconds.

Error box now used sprite "confirm_1" rather than "decide_0" ie ! instead of ?

Better internal error message passing.

Now searches the application messages file for user friendy messages rather
than just showing error numbers. Only a small number of messages at present.

Redial delays now closer to TLFS:
  No dialtone - retries after 5 minutes.
  Line busy   - first retry after 30 seconds, then every 5 minutes
These will be revised later.
