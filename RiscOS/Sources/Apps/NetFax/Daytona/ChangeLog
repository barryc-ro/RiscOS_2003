Version:	0.46
Date:		1998-04-07
Name:		Richard Manby
CVS tag:	rmanby_Daytona-0_46

Fixed PAN-01725 User sets retries (as per spec) rather than total number of
  dialups (though internally we convert from retries to dialups).

Preliminary work for PAN-01755 (Validate configuration before allowing fax/email operation)

Type mismatch between !Setup and !Daytona's view of external_access_pausewait
and international_access_pausewait fixed. !Setup passes the string to use rather
than a number.

Added extra fax error message texts to messages file

Also the Version strings in both the Messages file and Resource file have been
updated to V0.46, dated 07-Apr-1998.

Version:	0.45

CVS tag:	blaughto_Daytona-0_45

Fixed some bugs that were affecting 'complicated' email downloads.  eg.
Mailboxes with quite large multi-page documents where only part of
document may be downloaded.  The effects that these had could have been
many and varied depending on the individual mailbox, but in general:

* 'Acorn POP3 null address' errors should no longer occur as described in
   PAN-01773.

* In cases where Daytona only downloads part of a mailbox (possibly
  splitting a document in the process) it should download messages in a
  sensible order: before it may have done odd things like leave a single
  page out of a document and print it at the end.  This doesn't fix a specific
  fault report, but would alter the sequence of events desribed in:
  PAN-01769 to PAN-01773 (unfortunatley by the time you do what's described
  in PAN-01770 things have gone wrong to the extent where any further behaviour
  will be unpredictable).

Version:	0.44
Date:		1998-04-03
Name:		Richard Manby
CVS tag:	rmanby_Daytona-0_44

Dialling in data mode, finding a fax machine now reports:
  "Connection failed, retrying in fax mode"

Low level ZModem error messages now show the error number rather than
  "ZModem error (0x%.2x)"

Fixed PAN-01748 Memory leak creating email message.

Also the Version strings in both the Messages file and Resource file have been
updated to V0.44, dated 03-Apr-1998.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.43
Date:		1998-04-02
Name:		Simon Forrest
CVS tag:	sforrest_Daytona-0_43

Basically a user-interface message tidy up, for example, ensuring consistency
of use of words such as "Email" and capilisation throughout.  A number of
minor code alterations were required to "SendQ.c", "Screen.h" and "Screen.c"
in order to fix the following faults:

	PAN-00909
	PAN-01295
	PAN-01357

But mostly the Messages file has been altered to include more generic terms,
for example, replacing "Fax to..." with "Sending direct to...", etc.

Also the Version strings in both the Messages file and Resource file have been
updated to V0.43, dated 02-Apr-1998.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.42
Date:		1998-03-26
Name:		Richard Manby & Ben Laughton
CVS tag:	blaughto_Daytona-0_42

Daytona now copes with email messages being deleted behind its back. 
Also copes with POP3 servers that lie about the size of messages.  Fixed
bug in email retrieval not freeing resources at a certain point.

Fix for PAN-01713
When Daytona dials expecting to find another Daytona but finds a fax machine
(dialler reports no carrier or timeout) we retry in fax mode. The retry is
now immediate rather than after 30 seconds.

Error box now used sprite "confirm_1" rather than "decide_0" ie ! instead of ?

Better internal error message passing.

Now searches the application messages file for user friendy messages rather
than just showing error numbers. Only a small number of messages at present.

Redial delays now closer to TLFS:
  No dialtone - retries after 5 minutes.
  Line busy   - first retry after 30 seconds, then every 5 minutes
These will be revised later.
