Daytona now copes with email messages being deleted behind its back. 
Also copes with POP3 servers that lie about the size of messages.  Fixed
bug in email retrieval not freeing resources at a certain point.

Fix for PAN-01713
When Daytona dials expecting to find another Daytona but finds a fax machine
(dialler reports no carrier or timeout) we retry in fax mode. The retry is
now immediate rather than after 30 seconds.

Error box now used sprite "confirm_1" rather than "decide_0" ie ! instead of ?

Better internal error message passing.

Now searches the application messages file for user friendy messages rather
than just showing error numbers. Only a small number of messages at present.

Redial delays now closer to TLFS:
  No dialtone - retries after 5 minutes.
  Line busy   - first retry after 30 seconds, then every 5 minutes
These will be revised later.
