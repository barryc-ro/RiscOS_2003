Tried to tidy up interactive searches on phone numbers in order to remove
some incorrect matches that were reported in PAN-01860

CVS tag:	jberanek_address-0_26

Found a few more instances of changes made necessary by the new window
stacking scheme, one of which was causing a crash in certain circumstances;
made these changes.

Just found that the non-library numconvert was still in CVS.  Removed it.

Version:	0.24

Name:		John Beranek
CVS tag:	jberanek_address-0_24

Fixed PAN-01823, made some changes made necessary by the new
window stacking scheme.  Without the changes the address book failed with
a postmortem.

Fixed PAN-01143, by changing the validation strings for email address
writables so you can't type space or comma.

Fixed PAN-01833, made sure that routing information for an existing
record isn't overwritten by an update.
