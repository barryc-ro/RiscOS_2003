The calculation of whether the user had changed something in the edit window
was being done slightly incorrectly.  This meant that for some records if you
pressed home while editting a record you'd get the "Are you sure" screen
whether you'd actually changed something or not.  Fixed this, which fixes
PAN-01980

===============================================================================
Version:	0.29
Date:		1998-05-05
Name:		John Beranek
CVS tag:	jberanek_address-0_29

Changed the behaviour of the names search for enote recipient.  The user is
no longer allowed to select a record without an email address.  Fixes
PAN-01931

===============================================================================
Version:	0.28

Changed it so that the routing options scroll, as requested by PAN-01877

===============================================================================
Version:	0.27
Date:		1998-04-28
Name:		John Beranek
CVS tag:	jberanek_address-0_27

Tried to tidy up interactive searches on phone numbers in order to remove
some incorrect matches that were reported in PAN-01860

===============================================================================
Version:	0.26
Date:		1998-04-22
Name:		John Beranek
CVS tag:	jberanek_address-0_26

Found a few more instances of changes made necessary by the new window
stacking scheme, one of which was causing a crash in certain circumstances;
made these changes.

Version:	0.25

CVS tag:	jberanek_address-0_25

Just found that the non-library numconvert was still in CVS.  Removed it.

===============================================================================
Version:	0.24
Date:		1998-04-21
Name:		John Beranek
CVS tag:	jberanek_address-0_24

Fixed PAN-01823, made some changes made necessary by the new
window stacking scheme.  Without the changes the address book failed with
a postmortem.

Fixed PAN-01143, by changing the validation strings for email address
writables so you can't type space or comma.

Fixed PAN-01833, made sure that routing information for an existing
record isn't overwritten by an update.
