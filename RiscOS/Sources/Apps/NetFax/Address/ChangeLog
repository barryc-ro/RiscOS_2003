When an address update came in I differentiated records with different
creation dates as sufficiently different to change the record.  I don't
think this is valid behaviour.  No longer differentiates records on
creation date.

===============================================================================
Version:	0.34
Date:		1998-06-24
Name:		John Beranek
CVS tag:	jberanek_address-0_34

Added a bit more debug to the address book update code, to investigate
a reported fault.  Revamped some old and creaky search code, in an attempt
to clear up a reported fault (PAN-02118)....may have fixed it, cos I can't
seem to recreate the fault any more.  Changed an error message displayed
when the address book fills up, which fixes PAN-02113.  Changed test app code
a little.

===============================================================================
Version:	0.33

CVS tag:	jberanek_address-0_33

The fix done in v0.30 was only half successful, this version is fully
successful (hopefully) and _will_ fix PAN-01980.

===============================================================================
Version:	0.32
Date:		1998-05-19
Name:		John Beranek
CVS tag:	jberanek_address-0_32

Fixed a few memory leaks that were found in the address book update code.
Fixes PAN-02012

===============================================================================
Version:	0.31
Date:		1998-05-13
Name:		John Beranek
CVS tag:	jberanek_address-0_31

Corrected the handling of CAS address book updates.  Creation date was not
being handled correctly.  Coincidentally also correctly handling of
creation dates for inter-daytona transfer of address book records.

===============================================================================
Version:	0.30
Date:		1998-05-13
Name:		John Beranek
CVS tag:	jberanek_address-0_30

The calculation of whether the user had changed something in the edit window
was being done slightly incorrectly.  This meant that for some records if you
pressed home while editting a record you'd get the "Are you sure" screen
whether you'd actually changed something or not.  Fixed this, which fixes
PAN-01980

===============================================================================
Version:	0.29
Date:		1998-05-05
Name:		John Beranek
CVS tag:	jberanek_address-0_29

Changed the behaviour of the names search for enote recipient.  The user is
no longer allowed to select a record without an email address.  Fixes
PAN-01931

===============================================================================
Version:	0.28
Date:		1998-05-01
Name:		John Beranek
CVS tag:	jberanek_address-0_28

Changed it so that the routing options scroll, as requested by PAN-01877

===============================================================================
Version:	0.27
Date:		1998-04-28
Name:		John Beranek
CVS tag:	jberanek_address-0_27

Tried to tidy up interactive searches on phone numbers in order to remove
some incorrect matches that were reported in PAN-01860

===============================================================================
Version:	0.26
Date:		1998-04-22
Name:		John Beranek
CVS tag:	jberanek_address-0_26

Found a few more instances of changes made necessary by the new window
stacking scheme, one of which was causing a crash in certain circumstances;
made these changes.

===============================================================================
Version:	0.25
Date:		1998-04-21
Name:		John Beranek
CVS tag:	jberanek_address-0_25

Just found that the non-library numconvert was still in CVS.  Removed it.

===============================================================================
Version:	0.24
Date:		1998-04-21
Name:		John Beranek
CVS tag:	jberanek_address-0_24

Fixed PAN-01823, made some changes made necessary by the new
window stacking scheme.  Without the changes the address book failed with
a postmortem.

Fixed PAN-01143, by changing the validation strings for email address
writables so you can't type space or comma.

Fixed PAN-01833, made sure that routing information for an existing
record isn't overwritten by an update.

===============================================================================
Version:	0.23
Date:		1998-04-02
Name:		Simon Forrest
CVS tag:	sforrest_address-0_23

Altered the Messages file ONLY to change the routing labels, as requested in
PAN-01494.
