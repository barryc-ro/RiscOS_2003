Just found that the non-library numconvert was still in CVS.  Removed it.

Fixed PAN-01823, made some changes made necessary by the new
window stacking scheme.  Without the changes the address book failed with
a postmortem.

Fixed PAN-01143, by changing the validation strings for email address
writables so you can't type space or comma.

Fixed PAN-01833, made sure that routing information for an existing
record isn't overwritten by an update.
