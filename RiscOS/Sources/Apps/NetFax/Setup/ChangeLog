Schedule dial-ups now work correctly when only one dial-up time is requested,
although for some reason dial-ups on Saturday are still not being registered
and therefore missed. 

PAN-01754
Setup now ensures that given fax and phone numbers are valid and in
accordance with the other codes given. This allows the Daytona to function
even if no fax numbers are given.

PAN-01756
Setup now also validates some of the email settings so that fields that need
other fields to be filled in causes an error window to appear asking for
all the relevant fields to be entered.

PAN-01751
Scheduler should not hang when only one day is used as a dialup. Also added is 
safety code so that spurious characters are not displayed when a blank serial 
flash is first used.
