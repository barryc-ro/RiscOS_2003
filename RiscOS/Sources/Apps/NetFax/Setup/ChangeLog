PAN-01725
The default value for the number of dial-up retries is now set to 2.

PAN-01951
The default NAN token is now 100 again.

Cleaned up the code so there should be no compiler warnings from now on.

PAN-01844 - Revisited
Martin's explained that this fault report was actually a double fault, and 
there was a problem with some of the schedule settings. So, basically I've
fixed it.

Holidays go too quickly... :-(

PAN-01844
If there is a schedule for the standard week, and any of the set times are
not valid, then instead of specifying a day, the phrase 'the standard week'
is used.

PAN-01851
Missing pages may now be set to zero . This will turn missing page reporting
off.

PAN-01702
I've also cured the maximum email size fault. The maximum email size is now
400K, the minimum is 50K.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.35

PAN-01787
Hitting the cancel key in the Date/Time window caused an error, if the Timezone
had been set to anything that was less than GMT. This has now been fixed.

PAN-01672
The maximum number of characters in the login/response string is now 50 
characters per field. Setup dynamically resizes the data, but will produce
an error if the total number of characters in all the login/response strings
is more than 255.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.34
Date:		1998-04-14
Name:		Hed Simons
CVS tag:	hsimons_Setup-0_34

Two major faults corrected. The scheduler will now correctly dial-up on the
right day (due to problems with which day was the start of the week, this
has now been overcome). This was PAN-01794.

The second fault is the randomise function for the schedule dial-ups. It is
now correctly set for ten minutes either side of an exact dial-up time.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.33
Date:		1998-04-07
Name:		Hed Simons
CVS tag:	hsimons_Setup-0_33

Schedule dial-ups now work correctly when only one dial-up time is requested,
although for some reason dial-ups on Saturday are still not being registered
and therefore missed. 

PAN-01754
Setup now ensures that given fax and phone numbers are valid and in
accordance with the other codes given. This allows the Daytona to function
even if no fax numbers are given.

PAN-01756
Setup now also validates some of the email settings so that fields that need
other fields to be filled in causes an error window to appear asking for
all the relevant fields to be entered.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.32
Date:		1998-03-26
Name:		Hed Simons
CVS tag:	hsimons_Setup-0_32

PAN-01751
Scheduler should not hang when only one day is used as a dialup. Also added is 
safety code so that spurious characters are not displayed when a blank serial 
flash is first used.
