===============================================================================
Version:	0.45
Date:		1998-06-05
Name:		Hed Simons
CVS tag:	hsimons_Setup-0_45

Removed a debug entry that was being sent to the log when tasks requested
receipt of new options.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.44
Date:		1998-06-04
Name:		Hed Simons
CVS tag:	hsimons_Setup-0_44

Solved a small date setting bug and cleaned up log debug code. Small update.

PAN-01985
The scheduler error messages are now correct as referring to certain user
errors.

PAN-02027
If a blank line is entered as the NAN, then the NAN resets to the value 100.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.42

CVS tag:	hsimons_Setup-0_42

PAN-01755
Email and fax validation now occurs and relevant flags are set if all of
the required data is available. Daytona should look at these flags and then
send the email/fax if they are set.

PAN-02033
The scheduler had major problems over the last 2 months. I managed to get
it working fine, then one day schedules caused it to lock horribly. I cure
this, only to find that weekly schedules now schedule for times that are
*before* the current time. I think I've finally fixed it by adding some
conditional code that is called if only one day is scheduled.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.41

CVS tag:	hsimons_Setup-0_41

PAN-01751
This has now been definately rectified. It was related to PAN-01958.

PAN-01958
The problem of two errors occuring at the same time I'm actually taking to 
be mainly a scheduler problem. As this was essentially the same error as
PAN-01751, it has also been rectified by alteration of how the scheduler code
is called when calculating a new dialup.

PAN-02016
Added a decision window asking if the user really wants to change the log
size as this will erase the current log.


===============================================================================

Life begins at 40...

PAN-01751
There was a problem with one day scheduling, in that the scheduler wouldn't
let you set just one day as a schedule dial-up. This has now been altered so
that one day schedules can be set. I still haven't been able to recreate the
problems given since 0.22...


===============================================================================
Version:	0.39
Date:		1998-05-06
Name:		Hed Simons
CVS tag:	hsimons_Setup-0_39

PAN-01725
The default value for the number of dial-up retries is now set to 2.

PAN-01951
The default NAN token is now 100 again.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.38
Date:		1998-04-30
Name:		Hed Simons
CVS tag:	hsimons_Setup-0_38

Cleaned up the code so there should be no compiler warnings from now on.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.37

CVS tag:	hsimons_Setup-0_37

PAN-01844 - Revisited
Martin's explained that this fault report was actually a double fault, and 
there was a problem with some of the schedule settings. So, basically I've
fixed it.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.36
Date:		1998-04-28
Name:		Hed Simons
CVS tag:	hsimons_Setup-0_36

Holidays go too quickly... :-(

PAN-01844
If there is a schedule for the standard week, and any of the set times are
not valid, then instead of specifying a day, the phrase 'the standard week'
is used.

PAN-01851
Missing pages may now be set to zero . This will turn missing page reporting
off.

PAN-01702
I've also cured the maximum email size fault. The maximum email size is now
400K, the minimum is 50K.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.35
Date:		1998-04-17
Name:		Hed Simons
CVS tag:	hsimons_Setup-0_35

PAN-01787
Hitting the cancel key in the Date/Time window caused an error, if the Timezone
had been set to anything that was less than GMT. This has now been fixed.

PAN-01672
The maximum number of characters in the login/response string is now 50 
characters per field. Setup dynamically resizes the data, but will produce
an error if the total number of characters in all the login/response strings
is more than 255.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.34
Date:		1998-04-14
Name:		Hed Simons
CVS tag:	hsimons_Setup-0_34

Two major faults corrected. The scheduler will now correctly dial-up on the
right day (due to problems with which day was the start of the week, this
has now been overcome). This was PAN-01794.

The second fault is the randomise function for the schedule dial-ups. It is
now correctly set for ten minutes either side of an exact dial-up time.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.33
Date:		1998-04-07
Name:		Hed Simons
CVS tag:	hsimons_Setup-0_33

Schedule dial-ups now work correctly when only one dial-up time is requested,
although for some reason dial-ups on Saturday are still not being registered
and therefore missed. 

PAN-01754
Setup now ensures that given fax and phone numbers are valid and in
accordance with the other codes given. This allows the Daytona to function
even if no fax numbers are given.

PAN-01756
Setup now also validates some of the email settings so that fields that need
other fields to be filled in causes an error window to appear asking for
all the relevant fields to be entered.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.32
Date:		1998-03-26
Name:		Hed Simons
CVS tag:	hsimons_Setup-0_32

PAN-01751
Scheduler should not hang when only one day is used as a dialup. Also added is 
safety code so that spurious characters are not displayed when a blank serial 
flash is first used.
