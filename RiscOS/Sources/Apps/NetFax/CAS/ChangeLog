A large number of small changes have been made which, in conjunction with
v0.47 of !Setup, are intended to make the CAS software conformant with
v0.04d of the CAS Specification document. In particular, the configuration
options recognised, and the allowed characters and numerical ranges, should
now agree with constraints imposed by !Setup.

As a result, many faults mentioning specification concerns can now be
regarded as fixed; these include:

PAN-01835, PAN-01864, PAN-01865, PAN-01866, PAN-01869, PAN-01870, PAN-01878,
PAN-01879, PAN-01881, PAN-01882, PAN-01883, PAN-01903, PAN-01905, PAN-01906,
PAN-01907, PAN-01908, PAN-01913, PAN-01914, PAN-01917, PAN-01918, PAN-01938,
PAN-01939, PAN-01984, PAN-02020, PAN-02021, PAN-02088

More substantial fixes include:

PAN-01861  CAS timezone problems
PAN-01862  CAS fails to change timezone until rebooted
PAN-01867  CAS 'Purge Day' sequence
PAN-01868  CAS 'PurgeTime' field
PAN-01900  CAS scheduler time shown incorrectly
PAN-01901  CAS scheduler days incorrect
PAN-01904  CAS cannot set ISP prompts
PAN-01916  CAS commands fail on excess arguments
PAN-01919  CAS cannot set Daylight Savings Time
PAN-01937  CAS variable ranges incorrect

(Note: the above lists of faults appear also in the ChangeLog for !Setup).
