03-08-98  To fix bug PAN-01868 (PurgeTime format)

             At present, treatment of the PurgeTime field, and of the [Polling] fields
             Monday, Tuesday etc. is common coded: that is, they are both described as
             AUFType_Tim fields. This is not a good idea, for several reasons:
                - PurgeTime has one argument, whereas the day fields each have four
                - Day field arguments can be "X" - indicating no change
                - The Setup application stores the PurgeTime in a different format to
                  the day field times

             So I've decided that !AdminUpda should treat these fields as different
             types: AUFType_Tim4 for day fields, and AUFType_Tim for PurgeTime (ie
             a single time value).

h.defs:
c.main:
c.export:    SendConfig (..)
c.process:   StoreAndEcho (..), Validate (..)
             Global edit to replace AUFType_Tim by AUFType_Tim4, and add new type AUFType_Tim,
             and associated code.


03-08-98  To note correctly changes to the Poll "day" fields (PAN-01900)

c.process:   StoreAndEcho (..)
             At present, any request to update a "day" field is confirmed as a true
             update, even if the value was not changed. Code for AUFType_Tim4 values
             in c.process (StoreAndEcho) has been rewritten to distinguish between
             updates and no change.


04-08-98  To fix bug PAN-01917 - add support for CaptureTimeOut

c.main:      Add new line defining CaptureTimeOut - an integer variable with range 2 to 60
             inclusive.


04-08-98  Minor edits to reduce number of compiler warnings

c.main:      Add extern declaration for ProcessMail (..)

c.process:   Add extern declaration for Export_Data (..)
             Add explicit cast to int for inet_addr (..) call


04-08-98  Fix bug PAN-01904 (ResponseString issues)

c.main:      Change maximum length from 31 to 255.

c.process:   CommandTokenise (..)
             Add code to allow escaped characters inside quoted arguments:
               \n    - is replaced by the newline character
               \<ch> - is replaced by ch for all other characters
             This makes it possible to include genuine newline chars
             inside a ResponseString argument.

h.defs:
c.main:
c.export:    SendConfig (..)
c.process:   StoreAndEcho (..), Validate (..)
             Add new type AUFType_StrF for the ResponseString argument - this
             differs from AUFType_Str only in its validation (none on content).


04-08-98  Replace PrintAfterDispatch by PrintEnotes

c.main:      Change the tag; this fixes an as-yet-unreported bug, whereby
             the wrong configuration variable was updated by CAS.


06-08-98  Revise escape sequence handling

c.process:   CommandTokenise (..)
             Only \n and \\ are allowed; others give "Bad value" response.


10-08-98  Coding clarification

c.process:   Process_Mail(..)
             Use correct #define symbols to identify message code in the
             Dayt_Setup_Message sent out after reconfiguration is complete.

h.defs:      Add #define for General_Hello - message code for Dayt_Setup.


10-08-98  Fields implemented now match revised spec.

c.main:      Remove Shared, FaxEncoding, UpdateFlash, UpdateOS,
             UpdateAppsCpnfig, UpdateDialUp, UpdateAdmin, UpdateAddressBook,
             UpdateForms, Backup, EmailConfirmSends, Confirmation,
             SendWaterMark, ReceiveWaterMark, AddressExport, all [Actions]
             except SendConfig, all [AddressBook] except Add, all [Forms].
             Add LocalHost, EtherLan, Netmask, EtherAddress, Router,
             RequestReceipt, SchedulerWeek, CaptureTimeOut.
             Replace PrintAfterDispatch by PrintEnotes.

c.export:    Comment out (#if FALSE ... #endif) those sections of code
             dealing with commands and actions that are no longer supported.


10-08-98  Coding tidy-up

c.export:
c.process:   Remove code associated with AUFType_Spc; originally this appears
             to have been special code to deal with TimeZones, but has not been
             used for some time.


10-08-98  Some further argument checking

c.main:      Maximum value allowed for DaylightSavings now set to 1.

c.main:      New type AUFType_Pau for PostPrefixPause and PostInternationalPause
c.process:   fields: only <empty>, W and <comma> are allowed.
c.export:
h.defs:


10-08-98  Allow comment lines

c.process:   CompileLine (..)
             Code added to ignore any line whose first character is #.


17-08-98  Changes to validation values

c.main:      "PrintBeforePurge" and "EmailBeforePurge" now have a length of 0
             specified - just like all the other AUFType_Flg values.
             Replace length of 4 by length of 0 for "PostPrefixPause" and
             "PostInternationalPause" - since these no longer need a max length.

c.process:   Validate (..) now checks the length of an IPA field.


18-08-98  Recognise commands with arguments

c.process:   ProcessMail(..)
             Code now allows space or = as the delimiter for the assignment field
             or command keyword.


18-08-98  MaxEmailSize is now measured in kilobytes

c.main:      Change min and max values to 50, 400 respectively.


19-08-98  Remove ConnectionHoldUpTime

c.main:      Line defining this assignment field commented out.


20-08-98  Implement revised validation proposals

h.defs:      New set of AUFType definitions to reflect new set of validation strings.

c.main:      Alter biglist[..] table to include new AUFType definitions and revised maximum
             length and range requirements. The mapping from old to new and vice-versa is:
                Str  -> Any, Nme, All           Any -> IPA, Str, StrF
                StrF -> Any                     All -> IPA, Str
                Int  -> Snt, Int                Nme -> Str
                Phn  -> Dig, Tel, Phn           Snt -> Int
                IPA  -> Any, All                Int -> Int
                                                Dig -> Phn
                                                Tel -> Phn
                                                Phn -> Phn
             Pau, IPN, Tim, Tim4 (now Tm4) and Flg remain unchanged.

c.process:   New and replacement validation strings (validall etc.).
             StoreAndEcho (..)
             Validate (..)
             Update case constants to reflect new AUFType definitions.

c.export:    SendConfig (..)
             Update case constants to reflect new AUFType definitions.


26-08-98  Require exactly twelve arguments for [AddressBook]/Add

c.main:      Specify minimum = maximum = 12 for number of arguments.
