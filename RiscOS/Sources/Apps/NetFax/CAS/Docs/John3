Here's a suggested format for a form template that would be used in
a CAS message to add a form.  There are 2 examples, one being a template
with a preset destination, and one where the user will choose the
destination.:

[Forms]
Add=FORM001,Preset Form,+441223725211,form-reply@acorn.com,3,Name,,Address 1,,Address 2,
Add=FORM002,Self Addressed Form,,,3,Name,,Address 1,,Address 2,

The format is described below:

Add=<Form ID>,<FormTitle>,<Preset fax destination (optional)>,<Preset Email Destination (optional)>,<Number of label/field pairs>,<Label 0>,<Field 0>,<Label 1>,<Field 1>,<Label 2>,<Field 2>

That's all,

John.

P.S. Also included is a draw file illustrating how such a template would
be stored in flash.
