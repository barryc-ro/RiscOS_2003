$Log$

Quick thoughts on how I'd do the message. This is intended for passing information to the Adrress Book and to Forms initially, but can be extended to include the logbook, scheduler and anything else.


Message Daytona_DataInterchange

Message data area...

4 bytes     Token     eg "ADDR" "FORM" etc...
4 Bytes     Command   eg 1 = Add, 2 = Delete, 3 = Purge etc...
4 bytes     Flags     Depends on command, eg Add, 0 = temporary, 1 = permanent
n bytes     Data      eg pointer to struct for Add, text for searches, etc...

A reply should always be generated with the reference fileds in the header juggled, and would normally be limited to a done or not done flag?
