Library is now capable of building the Inbox files in a RiscOS environment.  
Currently the library assumes that there is no mailbox processed and says
processing mailbox or if offline a comment about connect to fetch mail.


Wed 23rd September 1998
-----------------------

Library now sets its states correctly for Inbox processed and Inbox
unprocessed. Code added to support button presses in the Inbox screen, and
for entering the email client.

** Library now put in suitable state for Build Tree **

Header file added with BAL's browser interface code.  The code to call when
entering the email client, and the Compose, NetLink, Exit and "Read" buttons
on the Inbox implemented.  Compose, Read & Exit do not do anything, but
Netlink should inform the engine.

Added condition to redraw cbf that if the user is in the Inbox and it is
unprocessed when this FN is called a redraw will occur.

Removed the dependency -DRISC_OS which passed files to the RAM Disc.  Now
the !SetPaths file sets up a variable NCMailOutput$Dir where the files will
go.  In !SetPaths the variable is setup to point to RAM::.
