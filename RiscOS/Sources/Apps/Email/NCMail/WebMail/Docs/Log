Mon 21st September 1998
-----------------------

Library is now capable of building the Inbox files in a RiscOS environment.  
Currently the library assumes that there is no mailbox processed and says
processing mailbox or if offline a comment about connect to fetch mail.


Wed 23rd September 1998
-----------------------

Library now sets its states correctly for Inbox processed and Inbox
unprocessed. Code added to support button presses in the Inbox screen, and
for entering the email client.

** Library now put in suitable state for Build Tree **

Header file added with BAL's browser interface code.  The code to call when
entering the email client, and the Compose, NetLink, Exit and "Read" buttons
on the Inbox implemented.  Compose, Read & Exit do not do anything, but
Netlink should inform the engine.

Added condition to redraw cbf that if the user is in the Inbox and it is
unprocessed when this FN is called a redraw will occur.

Removed the dependency -DRISC_OS which passed files to the RAM Disc.  Now
the !SetPaths file sets up a variable NCMailOutput$Dir where the files will
go.  In !SetPaths the variable is setup to point to RAM::.

Thu 24th September 1998
-----------------------
Library now talks cleanly to Email engine, pulls down an Inbox and does a 
limited display of the data into a debug window.

** Added to CVS.

Fri 25th September 1998
-----------------------
Inbox display code now outputting to HTML.  Date is now being displayed in
the desired format but will require Internationalisation checking.

Emails with no subject are being properly trapped, and the INBOX_No_Subject
tag substituted so that there is something for the user to click on.

All text in the Inbox is escaped.

** Checked in as 0.03


Mon 28th September 1998
-----------------------
Read message HTML added.
Docs.Tags file updated to reflect Read Message tags.

Beginnings of ReadMsg code added to WebMail.

Added fix to stop user clicks being processed if the user has clicked Read
on a message.  Now state must be State_Inbox or State_Inbox_Unprocessed for
clicks to be responded to on the Inbox screen.

Added Debug.  ncmail:?page=Debug  will put the state machine details out
to the current debugging stream.

Tue 29th September 1998
-----------------------

Read Message code now complete in all respects except the attachment code.
All buttons on the read screen are functioning with the message ID's being
embedded in the HTML.  The To:, From:, Date:, CC, & Subject: fields are
filled in correctly, and escaped.

An extra parameter (void *) has been added to parser_parse_file() to allow
calling sub-components to pass data through to the relevant 
<component>_active_comment_found() function.  E.g. the Read Message screen
passes a pointer to the MessageDescriptor for the message being output
so that it isn't stored in globals.

Debugging links added to the bottom of the Inbox & Read screen which will
output data to the current debug stream when clicked.

** Checked in as 0.04

Wed 30th September 1998
-----------------------
Fixed bug where the correct icon wasn't being displayed in the Inbox screen
due to misunderstanding about the NEW bit in the MessageDescriptor.flags
var.

Bug in delete code fixed.

UI wasn't telling the engine when the UI was exited.

Error handling code now implemented.  If a page cannot be rendered for 
some reason then an attempt is made to render the Inbox.  If this fails
(or the failing page is the Inbox), then the HTML File ERROR.html is
displayed.  A list of error codes can be found in Docs.ErrorCodes.

Support for MessageDescriptor.fromreal & MessageDescriptor.fromaddr added.
Support for EntityDescriptor.flags added.

Read message screen now displays only attachments that the EmailLib understands
or best attempt views.

** Checked in as 0.05

Fri 02nd October 1998
---------------------

Fixed grammar in Messages file to do with non-viewable attachments.
Added Compose HTML page.
Documented all tags in Compose.html and added necessary bits to Messages file.

** Checked in as 0.06

Mon 05th October 1998
---------------------

Added support to truncate From & Subject text in the Inbox to prevent wrapping.
Fixed bug where Attachment type wasn't always being displayed correctly.

** Checked in as 0.07

Fixed bug where first line of every attachment was indented by one space.
Added Popup dialogue HTML and added tags to Docs.Tags.

** Checked in as 0.08


Tue 06th October 1998
---------------------

Added support to lock-down the UI as soon as a click is received until the
new page has been rendered etc.

Added debugging to check eng_get_mailbox_list() return codes.

** Checked in as 0.09

Beginnings of support for PopUp dialogues added.  Doesn't work yet due to 
limitations of ANT URL Protocol.

Added support for generic Compose/Reply/MailTo/Forward screens in SendMsg.c
Then added Compose.c which contains compose-specific code.

Compose screen now builds and allows the user to cancel the message.

Feedback.c added which has beginnings of animator support.

** Checked in as 0.10.


Thu 08th October 1998
---------------------

WebMail is now capable of sending messages to multiple receipents.

** Checked in as 0.11

Added support for initial PopUps.  No text is displayed in the buttons
but functionally working.  BrowserIF doesn't display them as yet.

** Checked in as 0.14

Fri 09th October 1998
---------------------

Finished PopUp code.  Added support for eng_register_status() but 
currently only outputs debugging when the callback is called.

** Checked in as 0.16

Compose now complete with PopUp support.  Status boxes (PopUps with
no buttons) now implemented.

** Checked in as 0.17

Added support in MailTo: to accept requests from browserif.c and 
to exit cleanly if Cancel clicked.

** Checked in as 0.18

Proper engine return codes now trapped in ReadMsg screen.  SendMsg 
screen already implemented.

Inbox now traps engine return codes and displays the appropriate
message to the user.  Doing a disconnect during a fetch of an
unprocessed Mailbox's headers isn't quite right yet.

** Checked in as 0.19

Mon 12th October 1998
---------------------

PopUp dialogue's HTML improved.
Added support for eng_register_status() to allow the engine to inform the
user of problems.

Completed MailTo support, but untested.

** Checked in as 0.21

Added support for retrieving a message on the server while offline.
Engine PopUp code validated
ENG_CONNECTFAILED now trapped in eng_read_message().  This occurs if
the user attempts to cancel a Do you Want to connect to retrieve this
message.
Initial reply code added.

MailTo: support validated.  Small change was required to Compose.html
to fix tag in the wrong place.

** Checkin 0.22 was by Ben adding browserif.c++, removing browserif.c and
tidying up.

** Checked in as 0.23

Added UserSel.html for User Selection screen.  Initial Tags added to
Messages file too.

Better support for Engine return codes added.

** Checked in as 0.24

Thu 15th October 1998
---------------------

Added support for new eng_return struct which replaces eng_rcode in
Callback functions.

Can now only be used with Engine 0.25 & Email Lib 0.49 or above.

Reply code now fully working.  Due to changes in the Engine return codes not
all conditions will be trapped in this build.  This will be rectified in the
next release.

Added Test obey file to setup NCMail to run from NFS on an NC.

** Checked in as 0.25

Fri 16th October 1998
---------------------

Modifications made to accept two URLs to exit to; one for Online and one for
Offline.


Sun 18th October 1998
---------------------

Started work on the User Selection screen.  Will now render the screen with 
Dummy information.


Mon 19th October 1998
---------------------

User selection screen code completed.  Currently due to being unable to test
with NCMA, the following can be done:  If NCMALite is not in the modules list
then the function usersel_get_fake_user_details() is called and produces valid
data for you to select from.  When Complete has been selected, the StartEmail
page can be reloaded into Fresco and the Email Client entered.  If NCMALite is
present then it will attempt to communicate properly.  This is untested.

Tue 20th October 1998
---------------------

Added support for auto-configuring one user without showing the UserSelection
screen.  When NCMail receives MailTo: orFresco's Email button a check is made
for a valid user and a warning displayed if not valid.

Will not behave as expected until Engine 0.28 is available.

** Checked in as 0.27


Thu 22nd October 1998
---------------------

Added sizes to use for widths of form elements in Compose screen for TV
modes.

When displaying Inbox no check is now made for messages with the Error bit
set.

Locking & Unlocking of directories now implemented when client is entered
and exited.

Modified ReadMsg to display number of attachments as part of each
attachment header (e.g. Part 1/3....)

Mon 02nd November 1998
----------------------

User selection now working reliably on the NC.  If one user is configured then
user selection is not shown.

usersel_boot_ncma() doesn't work.

** Checked in as 0.38

Wed 04th November 1998
----------------------

Problems with NCMA cache refreshing rectified.  Webmail *must* be built with 
Engine 0.39.

WebMail now communicates correctly with NCMA.  This is via a horrible kludge
as NCMA doesn't accept URL broadcast messages.  When an ncma: link is clicked in
a webpage Fresco converts that into an ncma_urc <url> command which it passes
using _kernel_oscli().  This is f******* stupid.  Code still remains in place to
do this properly.  If NCMA is ever fixed then change the NCMA_Success & 
NCMA_Failure constants in UserSel.h and replace the _kernel_oscli() calls with
browserif_sendurl() calls in function usersel_call_ncma() in UserSel.c.

** Checked in as 0.37

Added fix where if you entered the User Selection screen, hit Cancel and then
entered the screen again it would fail because a check wasn't made for a NULL
string.

Fri 06th November 1998
----------------------

Added forwarding support from the Read screen.  HTML updated (again).

Tue 10th November 1998
----------------------

the forward code.

** Checked in as 0.43

Wed 11th November 1998
----------------------

Abstracting Inbox display code so that it can be used by both the advanced and
normal inbox displays.

Format that date should be displayed in is now stored in the Messages File to
improve internationalisation.

Fixed bug where ForwardMsg screen didn't exit cleanly.

Moved to a more flexible screenmode system.

** Checked in as 0.44


Thu 12th November 1998
----------------------

Fixed exiton/exitoff bug.
Added Advanced Inbox code.

Reverted to hard coded screen width control due to bugs in new code and deadline.
Added NCFresco alias to allow Email button on Fresco's toolbar to work.

Added copy of Res file to export Resources phase in MainMake.
Updated WimpRegistry to listen for Toolbox_ObjectAutoCreated event.

** Checked onto trunk to allow build to work.

Thu 19th November 1998
----------------------

Added fix around #ifdef WORK_AROUND_NCMA_BUG so that if the entry urls
were ncma:... then they are sent via the command line instead until NCMA
works with wimp messages.

Merged in changes to Messages file by SBF.

Fixed bug where having no users configured threw an error if Connect was
clicked on.

Set timout to 15 minutes.

Modified Advanced HTML to allow the Delete & Forward buttons to work.

** Checked in onto branch as WebMail-0_46-1_48_2_4.

Completed Toolbox Feedback code.

Forwarding code added but untested due to engine bug at this time.

Mon 23rd November 1998
----------------------

Fixed tables in both Inboxes to work better in 800x600 screen modes.
Updated UserSel.html to have 15 pixels indentation to avoid the text being
very close to the screen edge.  Removed debugging footers from HTML pages.

Added support for ENG_BADFORWARD to eng_send_message callback function.

StripDepnd added to !MkClean.

** Checked in onto branch as WebMail-0_46-1_48_2_5.

Tue 24th November 1998

** Checked in as 0.52
** Build 03-03

Fixed Inbox_L.html which was screwed up by the merge

** Checked in as 0.53

Thu 26th November 1998
----------------------
Updated feedback support to close window during dialling phase.  It is re-opened
when the Engine reports that it is looking for the POP3 server.

** Checked in as 0.54

Added code to close feedback window if we go inactive via logout or standby.
Fixed problem with Toolbox feedback window where it was opening in the wrong
state.

Fixed mistake in RFC822 support where it assumed that headers were present.

Fixed memory leak in UserSelection where smartcard details never got free'd.

** Checked in as 0.55

Mon 30th November 1998
----------------------

Fixed Debug code which could cause a postmortem.
Screenmode code altered to deal with a bad return from the Messages file.

** Checked in as 0.56

Added atexit() support to free up exit on & off when we quit.

Tue 01st December 1998
----------------------

Added support for exiting the email client online and dealing with situations
where the exiton url can't be rendered.

Moved exit code from Entry.c to new file Exit.c.

Untested support for dealing with Postmortems.  Engine sends code to us as a 
generic status prompt on startup if it determines we died.  We then inform the
user there was a problem, and reset the UI to something sensible.

Tidied up text in Advanced Inbox delete.  If number of selected messages is 1
it uses the delete text from the Read screen which is singular, otherwise it
refers to the selected messages.

** Checked in as 0.57

Added eng_email_active() call to postmortem code to ensure that the engine
would start to fetch messages if we did a connect.

** Checked in as 0.58

Fixed a memory leak in usersel_get_fake_user_details().
Fixed redirection timer value in Exit.html from 5 seconds to 0.

** Checked in as 0.59

Fixed feedback code.  Once connection is established, feedback was meant
to display 'Processing Inbox' and then 'Messages found: x' or
'Fetching Details...' on the next line.  The top line wasn't being displayed.

Feedback screen now appears a user defined offset from the bottom of the screen
and horizontally centred.  This should avoid interaction problems where the 
window might obscure a popup from another app.

Feedback window is now blanked when being closed before a popup operation.  This
should avoid getting out of sync with what is really happening.

** Checked in as 0.60

Fixed bug in MainMake where Exit.html wasn't being exported in ROM phase.
Updated Res file to make icons closer together and window smaller.
PopUp.html had a vertical left indent.  Now removed to improve alignment

** Checked in as 0.61

Wed 02nd December 1998
----------------------

Feedback code.  When a status message comes in we now check to see if we are open.
If in Unprocessed mode we open.

Status prompt code.  Added support for trapping errors -38, -37, -34 and -16 which
require us to reset various things.

Thu 03rd December 1998
----------------------

Regressed Feedback code a bit.  A change was made in 0.60 to blank the window when
a popup was opened.  This was causing problems and has been removed.  The main
reason for doing this was to clear the field upon connection.  The fields are now
blanked when the Connect button is pressed [AWNCMail-002].

New user selection screen from MMoir included [JMF001].

Updated Email button command for Fresco's toolbar.  Wouldn't return user to NCMA
if exit offline used.

Reinstated eng_validate_email_address() call in User Selection that got trashed
by cvs merge.

** Checked in as 0.62

Changed offset value for Feedback window to fix fault report [JMF005].

Added the hourglass to fetching of messages.  It will be turned off upon 
receipt of the callback from the engine, or in the case of a problem.  If the 
message is large Fresco will still blank the screen for a period of time.  This
issue has been raised as a fault [RDW-014] with SMiddleton.

** Checked in as 0.65

Changed Delete Submit type in Advanced Inbox to POST so that large numbers of
deletes work.

Added Hourglass on during Inbox (& Advanced) building phase.
A few MemCheck_UnRegisterMiscBlock() calls added.

** Checked in as 0.66

Mon 07th December 1998
----------------------

Updated Messages and Compose.html, Index_L and Advanced_L to work better on 
TVs and Monitors.

** Checked in as 0.67

WebMail now detects if the browser dies but doesn't do anything else yet.

Fixed mistake of RDW's in UserSel.c where the debug was broken by his passing
of ncfresco:welcome as the exit URL.

Fixed Internationalisation problem with:
  * UserSel.  Includes UserSel.html
  
Updated internationalised html files.

** Checked in as 0.70

Tue 08th December 1998
----------------------

Added check for active Email client when the browser crashes and dies.  If 
Inactive nothing happens, otherwise we inform the user and recover [RDW-001].

Added call to Locale to sort out Month names in date fields.

Feedback window was raised in 0.65 but not quite far enough.  Now 134 OS Units from
bottom of screen.

Text being placed on UserSelection screen wasn't being HTML escaped.

Added cursor colour to white on TextArea [CW981204c].

In 0.62 support was added to trap a list of engine error codes and reset portions
of the UI as well as output the proper error to the user.  ENG_POPCONNECTFAILED
was listed in the header file as 'Not in use' - it is.  Added to the list.  Fixes
bug [AWNCMail-004].

Added support to both Inbox building routines to not display messages marked for 
deletion.  This gets around a bug in the engine where a message that is being
downloaded could be "deleted" in the Advanced Inbox, destroying the pointer to it
and causing a crash.

** Checked in as 0.71

Fixed timeout value.  Change from 2 -> 15 lost during merge.

When the browser dies and restarts if the email client had been in UserSelection
then nothing would happen.  When the user subsequently clicked on the Email 
toolbar button unpredictable things could happen.

Added Print support to Web pages - all variants.

** Checked in as 0.72

Thu 10th December 1998
----------------------
Small fix made to Reply code to prevent memory leak where to, subject & cc text
passed from engine got replaced and not free'd first.

Updated Frame parent pages (Advanced, Inbox, Read) to use noscale; meta tag.
Added the same tag to all country variants of Compose.html.

Added fix to Messages file for Inbox_No_Subject.

Wed 16th December 1998
----------------------

Bug found where Delete is a multitasking operation and if deleting lots of 
messages from the advanced inbox it was possible to go anywhere in the UI
and see inconsistent inboxes etc.

** Checked in as 0.76

Bug [AWNCMail-008] where NCMA could close our PopUp dialogues.  Target __dbox
replaced with __dbox_ncmail.  Now only we can close our PopUps.  If we have
one open when the user confirms a standby Fresco closes it for us.

** Checked in as 0.77.

Thu 17th December 1998
----------------------

All files generated and used by WebMail are now locked to prevent deletion by
CacheFS until the operations are complete.
