Mon 21st September 1998
-----------------------

Library is now capable of building the Inbox files in a RiscOS environment.  
Currently the library assumes that there is no mailbox processed and says
processing mailbox or if offline a comment about connect to fetch mail.


Wed 23rd September 1998
-----------------------

Library now sets its states correctly for Inbox processed and Inbox
unprocessed. Code added to support button presses in the Inbox screen, and
for entering the email client.

** Library now put in suitable state for Build Tree **

Header file added with BAL's browser interface code.  The code to call when
entering the email client, and the Compose, NetLink, Exit and "Read" buttons
on the Inbox implemented.  Compose, Read & Exit do not do anything, but
Netlink should inform the engine.

Added condition to redraw cbf that if the user is in the Inbox and it is
unprocessed when this FN is called a redraw will occur.

Removed the dependency -DRISC_OS which passed files to the RAM Disc.  Now
the !SetPaths file sets up a variable NCMailOutput$Dir where the files will
go.  In !SetPaths the variable is setup to point to RAM::.

Thu 24th September 1998
-----------------------
Library now talks cleanly to Email engine, pulls down an Inbox and does a 
limited display of the data into a debug window.

** Added to CVS.

Fri 25th September 1998
-----------------------
Inbox display code now outputting to HTML.  Date is now being displayed in
the desired format but will require Internationalisation checking.

Emails with no subject are being properly trapped, and the INBOX_No_Subject
tag substituted so that there is something for the user to click on.

All text in the Inbox is escaped.

** Checked in as 0.03


Mon 28th September 1998
-----------------------
Read message HTML added.
Docs.Tags file updated to reflect Read Message tags.

Beginnings of ReadMsg code added to WebMail.

Added fix to stop user clicks being processed if the user has clicked Read
on a message.  Now state must be State_Inbox or State_Inbox_Unprocessed for
clicks to be responded to on the Inbox screen.

Added Debug.  ncmail:?page=Debug  will put the state machine details out
to the current debugging stream.

Tue 29th September 1998
-----------------------

Read Message code now complete in all respects except the attachment code.
All buttons on the read screen are functioning with the message ID's being
embedded in the HTML.  The To:, From:, Date:, CC, & Subject: fields are
filled in correctly, and escaped.

An extra parameter (void *) has been added to parser_parse_file() to allow
calling sub-components to pass data through to the relevant 
<component>_active_comment_found() function.  E.g. the Read Message screen
passes a pointer to the MessageDescriptor for the message being output
so that it isn't stored in globals.

Debugging links added to the bottom of the Inbox & Read screen which will
output data to the current debug stream when clicked.

** Checked in as 0.04

Wed 30th September 1998
-----------------------
Fixed bug where the correct icon wasn't being displayed in the Inbox screen
due to misunderstanding about the NEW bit in the MessageDescriptor.flags
var.

Bug in delete code fixed.

UI wasn't telling the engine when the UI was exited.

Error handling code now implemented.  If a page cannot be rendered for 
some reason then an attempt is made to render the Inbox.  If this fails
(or the failing page is the Inbox), then the HTML File ERROR.html is
displayed.  A list of error codes can be found in Docs.ErrorCodes.

Support for MessageDescriptor.fromreal & MessageDescriptor.fromaddr added.
Support for EntityDescriptor.flags added.

Read message screen now displays only attachments that the EmailLib understands
or best attempt views.
