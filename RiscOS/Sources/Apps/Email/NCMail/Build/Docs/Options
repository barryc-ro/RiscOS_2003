Name:		RDW_SPEEDUP_HACK
Author:		RDW
Defined as:	
Used by:	Engine
Description:	A quick hack to speed up the parsing of email headers.
		EmailLib parsing from file is very inefficient at present,
		so when this is defined the file holding the headers is
		copied to RAM and the EmailLib told to parse it from there.

Name:		BUILDENV_NAME
Author:		RDW
Defined as:	<string literal>  eg.  "Desktop"
Used by:	All components
Description:	Defines the name of the build env. file being used.

Name:		READMSG_IMAGES
Author:		SNB
Defined as:	
Used by:	WebMail
Description:	Builds support into WebMail so that MIME attachements of
		type image/* are displayed.

Name:		READMSG_ANCHORS
Author:		SNB
Defined as:	
Used by:	WebMail
Description:	Builds support into WebMail so that there are Next/Previous
		links to nagivate quickly between attachements

Name:		NEW_CONNECTION_BROKEN_BEHAVIOUR
Author:		AW
Defined as:	
Used by:	Engine
Description:	If mail server connection is broken during download of
		headers or messages, NCMail attempts to reconnect and
		carry on from where it left off if this flag is defined.

Name:		ABSOLUTE_MAX_SIZE
Author:		AW
Defined as:	
Used by:	Engine
Description:	If the ABSOLUTE_MAX_SIZE flag is defined, NCMail reads the
		value of NCMail$AbsoluteMaxSize and does not download any
		emails larger than this during normal download. The messages
		can still be fetched by selecting them individually for
		reading.

Name:		CHECK_FOR_NCMALITE
Author:		SNB
Defined as:	
Used by:	WebMail, Engine
Description:	Runtime check for the presence of NCMALite.  If not defined
		NCMail assumes NCMALite is present.  I think the Engine
		switches on this thinking this indicates a desktop build.
		This is not the case.  This needs fixing.

Name:		WORK_AROUND_NCMA_BUG
Author:		SNB
Defined as:	
Used by:	WebMail

Author:		RDW
Defined as:	
Used by:	Engine
Description:	Put in for machines that have CacheFS loaded, but don't
		have to CacheFS modified kernel.  The code is just a
		temporary fix to make NCMail work on an STB.  Needs to be
		more advanced so that works out the max. size cachefs
		area can grow to and return that in the FreeMem() func. in
		Engine.

Name:		gorilla
