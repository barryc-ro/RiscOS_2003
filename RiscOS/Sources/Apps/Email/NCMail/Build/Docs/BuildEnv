BuildEnv
--------

NCMail now has a build environment header file which is required for all
builds, all phases.  It is selected by setting BUILDENV in the AMU command
line parameters (or !Builder options) to the required header file.  eg.

	BUILDENV=Funai2

to select Funai2 build environment.


The environment files reside in NCMail.Build.Env
CommonEnv.h defines basic, common options that all build environments use.
All the other files are environment specific options.  eg. Funai2, Desktop,
STB, etc.

Each specific env. file *MUST* include CommonEnv.h *AND* define BUILDENV_NAME
to the name of that build env.

The list of current Build env. files is defined in "Envs" in this directory.
This file should be kept up to date.

The list of current Build env. #define options are documented in "Options" in
this directory.  This file should be kept up to date.

The Main Build.Makefile also passes through the RISC OS Build Sys. Vars as
follows:

Sys. Var.	#define
---------	-------
Locale		LOC_$(LOCALE)
Keyboard	KBRD_$(KEYBOARD)
Machine		MACH_$(MACHINE)
System		SYS_$(SYSTEM)
UserIF		UIF_$(USERIF)
Display		DISP_$(DISPLAY)
Build		BUILD_BUILD


Currently nothing uses these, but they are defined now for future use.
They have all had a small prefix put on them (eg. LOC_, KBRD_, etc.)
so that having System set as "Funai" can be differentiated from Build
of "Funai".

Example Build Env file: Desktop
-------------------------------

Desktop is the env. file for a Desktop build.  It defines BUILDENV_NAME as
"Desktop", #includes "CommonEnv.h" and defines the options required in
a 'generic' Desktop build.  Desktop.h (as of 1999-01-12) is shown below:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#if !defined(NCMail_Env_Desktop_h)              /* Sentry, use file only if it's not already included. */
#define NCMail_Env_Desktop_h

/* File:    Desktop.h
   Purpose: Options for RISC OS Desktop build
