Below is listed the main code consitituents of this directory along with
what type of code they are
 C		- compiled C code
 ASM		- assembled code
 BASIC		- BASIC, may be crunched or not


Data				- Directories used whilst shrinking and 
ShrunkRes			- assembling the files for the build

Source for some of these is available


The RealAudio 5 source release from WSS contains the following

 1) source to MFSRA module
 2) source to PNA module
 3) WSS source to 14_4, 28_2, dnet, SIPR sound codecs (major part of
 each module is the precompiled libraries from RealNetworks).
 4) WSS source to all the other sound codecs including the nominally
 Acorn ones.

That leaves the following source that we *don't* have from WSS

 1) source to MovieFSMod
 2) source to KickStart
 3) source to MFSUniv
 4) source to 'Universal' fetcher 
 5) source to 'PNA' fetcher 
 6) source to the Decomp6xx video codecs

And the following Acorn code that we don't have source in CVS for.

 1) Uncrunched Player
 2) Decomp7 and Decomp17 video codec
 3) ScanRes tool

Source to the Decomp code used to be readily available, however since
they are never used anyway it's not really relevant. The Player we use
has been patched in its crunched form so although uncrunched would be
useful caution must be taken.

The rest of the BASIC code in !ARMovie sufficiently simple that it
hasn't been crunched.
