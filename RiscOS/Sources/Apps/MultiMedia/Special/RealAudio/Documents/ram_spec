                Format of ram files
                

The RiscOS port allows for ram files containing a list of urls and comments,
one per line.  Both \012 and \015 are  considered valid line terminators. 
Lines that are either empty or begin with a semicolon are treated as
comments.

Each url must have the following form:

	[pnm|http|file]:{//host{:port}}/resource{[?|$]ignored}


The resource should use '/' as the directory separator, and '.' between a
file name and its extension, even in the case of a local file.  The host part
should be present iff the protocol is pnm or http.

In the case of a ram file containing more than one url, the image filing
system part of the system is able to present the streams as ARMovie files,
only one at a time.  The choice of which stream to present is controlled by a
command "RAPickStream".  This allows a controlling application to play all
the streams in sequence by executing:

	RAPickStream 1
	Run ARMovie
	RAPickStream 2
	Run ARMovie
	   .
	   .
	   .

Until the image file is found to contain a text file called "Error" in place
of the ARMovie file.
