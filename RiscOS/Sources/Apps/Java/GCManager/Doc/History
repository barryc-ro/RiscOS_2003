1.00  30-Oct-97 RLougher
First version checked in

1.01 13-Jan-98 PWombwell
Added anti-twitter support

1.02 13-Jan-98 RLougher
Fixed bug that caused invalid regions to be forgotten when queue
overflowed.

1.03 12-Feb-98 RLougher
Added new command (GC_MemLimit) that allows a maximum limit to be set on
GCManager's memory usage.  Stops runaway applets creating loads of Graphics
objects that aren't garbage collected, because the garbage collector is
not incremental and basically crap.
