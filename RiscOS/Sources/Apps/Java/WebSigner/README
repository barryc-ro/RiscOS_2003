======================================================================

To import a new websigner. You must use Unix.
---------------------------------------------

 1) Create a directory 'Resources/src'

 2) Unzip the files into this new directory - ensure that the 'com'
directory is directly within the 'src' directory.

 3) From the WebSigner directory run the following command line:

./bin/perl.pl > Resources/viafile

 4) Delete the 'src' directory

 5) Run 'srccommit' to check in the new contents of the 'Resources'
directory (including 'viafile').

Warnings
--------

 The perl script will handle upto 100 files in a directory that share
a common prefix in the first 8 characters.

 It will handle the last directory in the path being longer than 10
characters (by truncating it) but will not handle any clashes that are
created.

 It won't handle directories other than the last being longer than 10
characters.
