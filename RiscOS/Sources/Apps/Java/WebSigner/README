To import a new websigner. You must use Unix.
---------------------------------------------

For UK builds

 1) Create a directory 'Resources/src'

 2) Unzip the files into this new directory - ensure that the 'com'
directory is directly within the 'src' directory.

 3) From the WebSigner directory run the following command line:

./bin/perl.pl > Resources/UK/viafile

 4) Delete the 'src' directory

 5) Run 'srccommit' to check in the new contents of the 'Resources'
directory (including 'viafile').


For non-UK builds

 1) Create a directory Resources/<Locale>

 2) Diff the build with the UK one and find out which files are different.
 
 3) Put the files that are different in a Resources/<Locale>/classes
directory, arranged in the same position in the directory structure as they
are in the  UK build and with the same truncated names.

 4) Copy Resources/viafile to Resources/<Locale>/viafile
 
 5) Edit Resources/<Locale>/viafile so that the files that differ are taken
from the Locale classes directory rather than the common one.

 6) cvssync and srccommit.
 

Warnings
--------

 The perl script will handle upto 100 files in a directory that share
a common prefix in the first 8 characters.

 It will handle the last directory in the path being longer than 10
characters (by truncating it) but will not handle any clashes that are
created.

 It won't handle directories other than the last being longer than 10
characters.
