//NOTE: The host calculates the number of logical scanlines that can fit
//in a _2K or _2K-8 segment based on the logical scanline being stored as
//a ddb.  A logical scanline stored as a ddb can take up to 3 more bytes than
//a logical scanline stored as a dib.  In the windows client, we store
//bitmaps as dibs.  It says in the WIN32 spec that "the bits in the array
//are packed together, but each scan line must be padded with zeroes to end
//on a LONG data-type boundary.
//For 16 color bitmaps -We got really lucky here since we want to blt
//right out of the cache.  If we pad dib scanlines to end on a LONG boundary
//(4 byte boundary), then a dib scanline will take up as much space as a
//ddb scanline because a ddb scanline is in units of 8 pixels and so is a dib
//scanline if its in quanta of 4 bytes.  This makes our movement into the
//cache a little more complex because we must insert zeroes where required.
//!!!!BUT For 2 color bitmaps and savescreenbitmap we will probably need to
//build a temporary bitmap because we must pad all the scanlines to end on
//on LONG boundaries!!!!
