Fixing headers
==============

Most of the headers don't compile due to the MS compiler allowing non-ANSI
features. The following changes have been made throughout to the headers
in 'sdk/citrix' and 'inc'.

 - Changed '$' in #define names to '__'

   This obviously requires corresponding changes to source code

 - Removed #pragma pack()

   This changes structure packing. Needs careful checking that it doesn't 
   matter. ** This has been the cause of many bugs so far **

 - Took out bitfields on structure elements that aren't integers.

   These are only used to limit the values that can be stored and so it doesn't
   matter that they are removed. Care to ensure that unsigned and signed
   distinction is maintained.

 - Removed redundant commas from the last element of an enumeration

   This just causes redundant warnings.

 - Changed EOL from CR/LF to LF

   This is necessary to get correct line numbers out under RISC OS.
