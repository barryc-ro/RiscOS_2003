    <h2> <a name="overview"> 1.0 Overview </a> </h2>

    <h3> <a name="icaoverview"> 1.1 Citrix ICA Overview </a> </h3>

    <P>The wide acceptance of Microsoft applications across the whole
    spectrum of market areas has always presented a problem to Acorn,
    as many potential customers would like to have the ability to run
    such applications, even if this is not the prime reason to
    purchase a computer system. This ability now goes far beyond the
    traditional desktop machine, and is relevant to Network Computers,
    STBs and even small embedded systems. Market areas that have
    particular influence include the corporate network, distance
    workers, small office users, and as an additional service to TV
    Centric STB technology.  

    <P>With the introduction of Windows 95 and Windows NT, Microsoft
    Windows is rapidly becoming the predominant 32-bit application
    platform. As I/S managers begin to introduce advanced Windows
    applications into the extended enterprise, they face the challenge
    of how to effectively deploy 32-bit applications beyond
    LAN-connected, PC users. This falls mainly into the domain of the
    NC, and presents a challenge.  

    <P>The challenge is two-fold. First, users may be remote to the
    LAN, connecting into the corporate network through high-bandwidth
    WANs, over the Internet, or from low-bandwidth dial-up lines. The
    second challenge is to provide this service from low-cost
    platforms that appear to the user to have a responsiveness of an
    expensive desktop PC.  

    <P>This is the area that Citrix have addressed with their WinFrame
    technology. This involves a network-centric, three-tiered
    application architecture. Under this model, the application
    execution and data storage occurs on a central server (or
    servers), and only a thin piece of client software is required at
    the client system. This uses universal, thin-client software in
    conjunction with an application server and a distributed Windows
    display protocol.  

    <P>Citrix WinFrame is a multi-user Windows application server
    based on Windows NT under license from Microsoft that supports
    enterprise application deployment using a thin-client
    architecture. This network-centric approach includes universal,
    thin-client software that works in conjunction with WinFrame
    multi-user application server software. Enterprise applications
    execute on the WinFrame server and are accessed through
    thin-client software over dial-up, LAN, WAN and Internet
    connections. The thin-client architecture provides users with
    consistent, high-performance and universal access to any type of
    application, including DOS, Windows 16, Windows 32 and
    client/server programs, regardless of available bandwidth or
    client hardware. The multi-user application server design provides
    I/S managers with an economical and manageable way to deliver
    applications across the extended corporate network or public
    Internet.  

    <P>The key to this thin-client architecture is a distributed
    Windows presentation protocol developed by Citrix, called
    ICA. This is a general-purpose presentation services protocol for
    Microsoft Windows. Conceptually, ICA is similar to the UNIX
    X-Windows protocol. ICA allows an application's logic to execute
    on a WinFrame multi-user Windows application server, located
    remotely. Only the user interface, keystrokes and mouse movement
    are transferred between the server and the client device over any
    network or communications protocol, resulting in minimal client
    resource consumption. ICA is designed to run over
    industry-standard network protocols, such as TCP/IP, NetBEUI,
    IPX/SPX, and PPP and industry-standard transport protocols, such
    as async, ISDN, Frame Relay and ATM.  

    <P>The ICA protocol presents only the user interface from an
    executing machine on the display of another machine. ICA provides
    true location independence for Windows applications by running the
    Windows application at one location and executing the program's
    user interface somewhere else. This distributed Windows
    architecture allows Windows 16, Windows 32 and client/server
    applications to perform at very high speed over low bandwidth
    connections. It also allows 16- and 32-bit applications to run on
    legacy PCs, old and existing Acorn computers as well as STB and NC
    platforms.  

    <P>Citrix has come into partnership with Acorn to provide a full
    end-to-end solution, and Acorn have agreed to supply the ICA
    client software into all appropriate platforms in the future.

    <h3> <a name="deliverables"> 1.2 Project Deliverables </a> </h3>

    <P>The project deliverables are as follows.

    <OL>
      <LI>A ROM application, !ICAClient, as detailed in <A
      HREF="#romversion">section 12.4</A> supplied as a linkable aof
      file and set of resources suitable for use in an NC2 ROM on NC2
      hardware.

      <LI>This document, which will constitute all technical
      information about the client.
    </OL>

    <h3> <a name="server"> 1.3 Server requirements </a> </h3>

    <P>Note that this client is designed to run with a WinFrame 1.7
    server. This server consists of a modified Windows NT 3.51 kernel
    plus custom connectivity software, purchased as a complete pack
    from a Citrix authorised reseller.

    <P>The Windows NT 4 equivalent of this server software is in beta
    test currently and is expected to be shipping by the end of this
    project. It consists of two parts, the Windows Based Terminal
    Server from Microsoft and the pICAsso protocol software from
    Citrix.

    <P>The RISC OS client will be development tested against a
    WinFrame 1.6 server and the beta pICAsso server as much as
    possible but will only be audited against a WinFrame 1.7 server.

    <h3><A NAME="icafunc">3.1 ICA Functionality</A></h3>

    <P>The ICA protocol is designed to provide high-performance
    Windows display over low-bandwidth connections, to run over any
    common transport mechanism, and to require minimal client
    resources. ICA is a robust and extensible protocol that includes
    protocol definitions for the following capabilities:

    <DL>
      <DT>Full-screen text presentation (<a href="#fullscreentext">3.2.2</a>)
      <DD>This is used for when running DOS applications full screen.

      <DT>Graphical Windows application screen presentation
      <DD>This is the default display mode and gives a screen that
	appears to be a Windows NT desktop.

      <DT>Keyboard (<A HREF="#keyboard">3.3.3</A>) and mouse (<A HREF="#mouse">3.3.4</A>) input

      <DT>Session control

      <DD>A session is identified by the client machine from which it
      came. If the client disconnects from the server without logging
      out then the session is saved to disc and is available next time
	it logs in.

      <DT>Print redirection (<A HREF="#printerspooler">3.3.5.3</A>)

      <DD>This allows printers connected to the client machine,
	directly or via a network, to be accessed from within the
	WinFrame session and to be visible to other clients conncected
	to the same WinFrame server.

      <DT>Memory cache

      <DD>Up to 8Mbytes of memory can be allocated to the cache. This
	keeps bitmaps and brushes that have been fetched from the
	server so they can be quickly reused.
    </DL>

    <P>It also includes these facilities not included in the first
    release of the client.

    <DL>
      <DT>File system redirection (<A HREF="#drivemapper">3.3.5.2</A>)

      <DD>This allows drives and directories visible from the client
      machine, whether local or remote, to be accessed from within the
      WinFrame session.

      <DT>WinFrame server browsing

      <DD>A broadcast protocol is used to determine what WinFrame
      servers exist on the network, this allows the Remote Application
      Manager (<A HREF="#mgr">4.8</A>) to automatically give a list of
      available servers.

      <DT>Persistent disc cache

      <DD>A connection can be set to use a persistent disc cache. This
      is kept across sessions and keeps compressed bitmaps sent by the
      server so that they need not be re-requested.
    </DL>

    <P>The ICA protocol is defined in the Citrix confidential
    specification <CITE>Intelligent Console Architecture</CITE><A
    HREF="#icaspec">[5]</A>. This document and the accompanying
    virtual driver specifications only define the protocols as
    implemented in the WinFrame 1.6 server release. Therefore the
    definitive specification is the source code provided by Citrix<A
    HREF="#icasource">[6]</A>.

    <h3><a name="icaprot">3.2 ICA Protocol</a></h3>

    <P>ICA is the physical line protocol used for communication
    between the client machine and the Citrix WinFrame application
    server. Thinwire is the name of the data protocol that exports the
    application's graphical screen image. Thinwire is a logical
    datastream that flows encapsulated in an ICA packet. Thinwire is
    not a physical protocol. The physical protocol, ICA, must
    guarantee the delivery of the thinwire datastream with no errors
    and no missing or out-of-sequence data.

    <P>From the perspective of the WinFrame application server, the
    major portion of the thinwire component is part of the GDI and
    video driver subsystem. This thinwire component, in conjunction
    with key elements in the WinFrame Win32 subsystem, generates
    highly optimized drawing primitives called the thinwire protocol.

    <P>The output of the thinwire protocol driver is a logical
    datastream that is sent back up a virtual channel API, which takes
    the datastream and encapsulates it into an ICA packet. Once the
    ICA packet is formed, it optionally passes through a series of
    protocol drivers to add functionality like encryption, compression
    and framing. It is then put on the transport layer and sent to the
    client. Once at the ICA client, the data packet passes through the
    same layers in opposite order, resulting in the graphical display
    of the remote application user interface on the client.

    <P>ICA packets consist of a required one-byte command, followed by
    optional data. This packet can be prefixed by optional preambles,
    negotiated at connection time, to manage the transmission of the
    packet. The nature of the transmission medium (LAN vs Async) and
    user defined options (e.g. compression) influence the total packet
    definition.

    <P>All ICA commands have the following format:

    <CENTER>

      virtual channel protocol packets.

      <DT><B>Frame Trail</B> <DD>Optional framing protocol
      trailer. Postamble for framing async transport data.
    </DL>

    <P>Only Command is always present in the packet. The preambles and
    postambles depend on the transport and the negotiation that takes
    place during initialization. The presence of Command Data depends
    on the Command itself.


    <h3><a name="icacmds">3.3 ICA Commands</a></h3>

    <P>There are several different categories of ICA commands. These
    categories are discussed below along with implementation notes.

    <h4>3.3.1 Control Commands</h4>

    <P>Control commands are a category of ICA command packets that
    manage the connection to the application server and the
    relationship to the local client user interface. This category of
    commands includes:

    <UL>
      <LI> Connection initialization and negotiation

	<P>e.g. connect, disconnect and reconnect messages.

      <LI> Screen control between the application server and the local
	client user interface

	<P>e.g. which of the available full-screen text modes should
	be used.

      <LI> Keyboard and mouse input to the application server
      <LI> Control of the local keyboard LEDs
    </UL>

    <h4><A NAME="fullscreentext">3.3.2 Full-Screen Text</A></h4>

    <P>Full-screen Text is a category of ICA command packets which
    allow the application server to control the local client display
    in a full-screen text mode.

    <P>These commands are rarely used for Windows
    applications. However, they are important for the support of very
    low-end devices and are encountered if a user runs a full-screen
    DOS session from within Windows. These commands involve less data
    transfer, and thus, higher display per performance. Packets are
    sent from the server to perform the following:

    <UL>
      <LI> Set the text modes
      <LI> Write characters
      <LI> Adjust character attributes
      <LI> Scroll
      <LI> Control the cursor
    </UL>

    <P>This is implemented by :-

    <UL>
      <LI>Switching to a suitable full-screen 16 colour mode (ie that
      matches those supported by VGA cards).

      <LI>Setting the palette to the 16 colour VGA palette.

      <LI>Running the display in text (VDU 4) mode.

      <LI>Reprogramming the font according to the given DOS code page
      (which can be set by the server).
    </UL>

    <h4><A NAME="keybaord">3.3.3 Keyboard</A></h4> 

    <P>PC scan codes are transmitted from the client to the server
    application. An ICA command packet can contain multiple scan
    codes.

    <P>The RISC OS keyboard API only provides key down information
    with ASCII or internal key values. To allow key up and down events
    to be generated with the correct PS/2 scan code values the
    KeyWatch module, originally written for the NC100 project <A
    HREF="#ncos">[1]<A>, is extended to provide this extra
    information. This work is detailed in its own specification <A
    HREF="#keywatch">[2]</A>.

    <P>Each key on the keyboard is sent in its PS/2 scan code
    form. The interpretation of the keys is performed by the
      server. 

    <P>No specific mechanism is provided within the client to enter
    keys not on the keyboard (eg Windows key). However since the PS/2
    codes are reverse mapped from the Acorn internal key numbers then
    any mechanisms used to provide extra keys (eg by use of Fn keys on
    IR and portable keyboards) also provide these keys to the WinFrame
    server. Special keys that have no equivalent PS/2 codes are
    ignored.

    <P>The keyboard layout in use is sent to the server on
    connection. This can be according to the user profile on the
    server or as specified. By default the RISC OS client identifies
    the keyboard layout from the configured Keyboard setting and send
    the appropriate code. This can be overridden by editing the ini
    file by hand.

    <DL>
      <DT><CODE>KeyboardLayout=(User Profile)</CODE>
      <DD>Use layout specified in the user profile on the WinFrame server.

      <DT><CODE>KeyboardLayout=(Auto Detect)</CODE>
      <DD>Use layout determined from configured keyboard value.

      <DT><CODE>KeyboardLayout=<i>&lt;country&gt;</i> | <i>&lt;language&gt;</i></CODE>
      <DD>The country or language name is looked up in the Module.ini
	file to a layout code.
    </DL>

    <h4><A NAME="mouse">3.3.4 Mouse</A></h4>

    <P>The ICA command set includes commands to input the position of
    the mouse using normalized coordinates. These commands can also
    track the mouse button status.

    <P>The mouse status is polled in the main client poll loop and
      changes in state are transmitted to the server. A configuration
      entry <i>MouseTimer</i> limits how often movement only commands
      are sent.

    <P>The protocol supports up to 3 buttons.

    <h4>3.3.5 Virtual Channel Commands</h4>

    <P>The ICA protocol provides multiplexed management of multiple
    virtual channels. A virtual channel is a session-oriented
    transmission connection that can be used by application layer
    code. Virtual channels are used to add functional enhancements to
    the client, independently of the ICA protocol itself. There is a
    set of ICA Virtual Channel commands that are used to send and
    receive this ICA protocol independent data.

    <h5><A NAME="thinwire">3.3.5.1 Thinwire Virtual Channel</A></h5>

    <P>Thinwire protocol is an ICA virtual channel protocol used to
    transmit presentation commands from Windows applications running
    on the application server to the client. The Thinwire protocol is
    highly tuned for transmission of Windows object display over
    low-bandwidth connections. This is accomplished through:

    <UL>
      <LI> Command and object specific intelligent compression with state persistence, e.g. run-length encoding for bitmaps
      <LI> Outboard complex clipping and complex curve drawing,
      <LI> Intelligent caching of Windows objects, such as bitmaps, brushes, glyphs and pointers
      <LI> Remote SaveScreenBitmaps
      <LI> Cross-session persistent caching
    </UL>

    <P>Rendering of the Thinwire graphics commands is accomplished by
    the use of a library implementing a subset of the Windows GDI
    calls. These are called by the Thinwire driver to write to the
    screen. Certain portions of the thinwire driver are rewritten to
    provide better speed and more efficient use of resources with the
    RISC OS back end.

    <h5><A NAME="printerspooler">3.3.5.2 Printer Spooling Virtual Channel</A></h5>

    <P>ICA includes a virtual channel protocol to transmit printer
    data to a client. There are two versions of the protocol which are
      sufficiently different that they are implemented in two
      different modules. One supports printing from DOS and Windows,
      the other from Windows only.

    <h6>3.3.5.2.1 DOS compatible printing</h6>

    <P>In the older version of the protocol the available printers are
      directly mapped onto virtual ports, Virtual LPT1 to LPT4 and
      Virtual COM1 to COM4.

    <P>The RISC OS client always maps the currently selected printer
    to Virtual LPT1. This happens whether the printer is connected to
      the parallel port or whether it is actually connected to the
      serial port or via a network.

    <P>The printer manager selection appears like this 
      <CENTER><IMG SRC="pics/printer1.gif"></CENTER>

    <P>It is the users responsibility to select the correct Windows
      printer driver for the printer as no facility exists to pass the
      name of the printer to the server.

    <h6>3.3.5.2.2 Windows printing</h6>

    <P>The newer protocol works in a very different way. The client
      printers appear in the Client Network and are connected to in
      the same way as normal network printers like this.

    <CENTER><IMG SRC="pics/printer2.gif"></CENTER>

    <P>As before, printer selection is performed under RISC
    OS. Whichever printer is selected as being active is the one that
      appears in this window. 

    <P>The client network is common to all the clients connected to
      this WinFrame server thus clients can be used as print servers
      for other clients.

    <P>Normally the user will have to select a compatible Windows
      driver manually however under certain circumstances this can be
      automated.

    <UL>
      <LI>If the <CODE>WindowsPrinter</CODE> ini file entry contains a
	valid Windows printer driver name then this is used.

      <LI>If all the following are true 
	<OL>
	  <LI>the ICAClient is running in iconbar mode
	  <LI>!Printers is running 
	  <LI>a Postcript printer is selected
	  <LI>the type of the Postscript printer is listed in the
	    Module ini file
	</OL>
	<P>then the printer type is converted to a Windows printer
	  driver name and this is used.
    </UL>
      
    <h3><a name="icatrans">3.4 ICA Protocol and Transport Layers</a></h3>

    <P>Beneath the ICA data packets, there are several optional
    protocol driver layers. ICA does not depend on these layers. Their
    existence and use is negotiated during the ICA handshaking that
    occurs at the start of a session. Since these layers sit below
    ICA, they can be removed or replaced. Additional protocol drivers
    can also be added. A wide range of supplied protocol modules allow
    ICA to work with all of the most prevalent transport technologies,
    such as TCP/IP, NetBIOS, IPX/SPX, and PPP/SLIP, supplying ICA true
    protocol independence.

    <P>The ICA protocol stack is dynamically configured to meet the
    needs of each transport protocol. For example, IPX is not
    reliable, so a reliable protocol driver is added above the IPX
    transport driver. However, since IPX is a frame-based protocol, a
    frame driver is not included in this particular ICA protocol
    stack. TCP, however, is a stream protocol; in this case, a frame
    driver is included. TCP is reliable, however, so this driver is
    not added to the stack.

    <P>The following diagram illustrates the ICA protocol stack and
    transport:

    <CENTER>
      <IMG SRC="pics/icastack.gif" WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=305 ALT="Protocol stack">
    </CENTER>

    <DL>
      <DT><B> Compression</B>

      <DD>The Compression protocol can encapsulate an encrypted ICA
      packet. The compression protocol is system replaceable and is
      not strictly defined in the ICA protocol definition.

	<P>The source to this driver is not included in the source
	distribution from Citrix so this functionality is not
	available in the RISC OS client.

      <DT><B> Encryption</B>

      <DD>The Encryption protocol can encapsulate an encrypted ICA
      packet. The encryption protocol is system replaceable and is not
      strictly defined in the ICA protocol definition.

	<P>The RISC OS client supports the basic encryption
	mechanism. Citrix make available a <i>Secure ICA</i> pack
	which implements better security using RSA cryptography. This
	is not available to us due to US Export controls.

      <DT><B> Reliable</B>

      <DD>The Reliable protocol is a transmission packaging protocol
      used to detect transmission errors and to request re-sends of
      data.  This protocol is used in conjunction with any transport
      mechanism that does not provide guaranteed delivery. Two such
      mechanisms are Novell's IPX and standard asynchronous
      connections.

	<P>As the RISC OS client is only implemented over TCP/IP this
	protocol driver is not necessary and so is not included.

      <DT><B> Framing</B>

      <DD>The Framing is a transmission packaging protocol used to
      manage stream-oriented communications, such as async and TCP. It
      is used in conjunction with Reliable protocol to provide an
      error-free data transmission.

	<P>The RISC OS client incorporates the RFrame protocol driver
	which provides framing for reliable transports (eg TCP/IP).

      <DT><B> Modem Control</B>

      <DD>The Modem control protocols allow for modem detection and
      initialization prior to connection.

	<P>These are not supported by the RISC OS client as it is
	  assumed that an external dialler has responsibility for
	  bringing a TCP/IP connection up.

	<P>See section 4.3 for a description of bringing the line up
	  on connection.

	<P>If the line drops whilst the session is in progress then
	the Windows session is aborted and the user is returned to the
	browser.

    </DL>

    <H3><a name="icaext">3.5 ICA Extensibility</a></H3>

    <P>ICA is a flexible and extensible protocol. First, the protocol
    is designed to accommodate varying degrees of client
    capability. During handshaking, the ICA client communicates such
    information as screen resolution, color depth, cache size, among
    other things. The protocol then adjusts to this information. This
    communication allows for a wide variety of ICA clients, ranging
    from fixed-function monochrome terminals to high-end workstations.

    <P>Through its virtual channel architecture, ICA can be extended
    to include new data types, such as sound and video (sound in ICA
    3.0 encompasses only the system beep, video is supported only when
    performed entirely through the standard Windows graphical display
    interface). Virtual channels can also be used to support auxiliary
    client devices, such as badge readers, wands and scanners.

    <P>Finally, the very modular design of the ICA protocol allows the
    supporting layers below it to be expanded. For example, the
    existing encryption layer could be augmented with RSA or DES
    encryption. Converters, such as an ICA to X.11, can be added
    in. And new transport protocols such as ATM can easily be
    supported.

    <P>The RISC OS client is composed of one linked application, thus
    extending it with new virtual drivers or protocol modules requires
    compilation of a new application. They cannot be added at run-time
    as is possible with the Windows implementation. The extensibility
      model of the original source code is maintained however to ease
      adding new drivers.

    </UL>

    <H3><A NAME="launch">4.1 Launching the client</A></H3>

    <P>There are two ways of launching the ICA client.

    <OL>
      <LI>Running an <a href="#icafile">ICA file</a>.

      <LI>Launching an <a href="#urlscheme">ICA:</a> URL.
    </OL>

    <P>Either of these will cause the client to load and the splash
      screen to be displayed.

    <H3><A NAME="startup">4.2 Initialisation</A></H3>

    <P>The client, when loaded, first ensures that a splash
    screen, conforming to Citrix's specification, is displayed to
    the user. 

    <CENTER><IMG SRC="pics/splash.gif" WIDTH=176 HEIGHT=182></CENTER>

    <P>This is described in detail in the Citrix Agreement,
    Exhibit D. The Splash screen is displayed for a minimum of
    two seconds.

    <P>After the splash screen has been removed the client starts an
    immediate connection to the server specified in the URL or ICA
    file.

    <H3><A NAME="connecting">4.3 Connecting</A></H3>

    <P>The client does the following

    <UL>
      <LI>Loads the Module, WFClient and possibly AppSrv files.
      <LI>Initialises all its components
      <LI>Resolves the host name
      <LI>Opens a connection to the server, dialling if necessary.
      <LI>Enters the initial handshaking
    </UL>

    <P>If the NC is connecting via modem and off-line when the client
      is started then it initiates a dial using the standard NC
      dialler. This causes the usual dialling status box to
      appear. If the login succeeds then the client continues with its
      connection to the WinFrame server. If it fails then it quits
      without further reporting and returns control to the browser.

    <P>Once the handshaking is complete the client goes single-tasking
      and switches screen mode. From this point the user is within
      Windows until they log out or switch out.

    <H3><A NAME="modes">4.5 Display modes</A></H3>

    <P>There are three display modes possible:-

    <OL>
      <LI>Scrolling text mode
      <P>This is the mode until a connection with the server is
	made. This enables error messages from the server to be
	displayed without any sophisticated protocol.

      <LI>Full-screen text mode 

	<P>This is used if a DOS box is started and then full-screen
	mode selected from its preferences window.

      <LI>Windows emulation mode
      <P>This is the full graphical user interface.
    </OL>

    <H4><A NAME="tv">4.5.1 Overscan support</A></H4>

    <P>When used on an NC or STB on a TV the edges of the screen are
    lost due to the overscan mode used. To counteract this the ICA
    client need to be put into an underscan mode so that it doesn't
    use the whole screen.

    <P>This can only happen when

    <OL TYPE="a">
      <LI>The WinFrame server being used supports variable
	resolution (all current shipping versions do), and

      <LI>One of the following cases is true.
    </OL>

    <OL TYPE="1">
      <LI>If no specific resolution is set and the client can tell
      that it is running on a TV.  

	<P>e.g. The <CODE>ModeFiles_MonitorType</CODE> SWI returns 0
	or 8 (this happens on NC Model 1 hardware with a TV attached)
	or the system variable <VAR>TV$Type</VAR> is set to
	<CODE>PAL</CODE> or <CODE>NTSC</CODE>.

      <LI>If no specific resolution is set and the new command
      <CODE>UseSafeArea=On</CODE> is set in the ICA or AppSrv file.

      <LI>If the resolution specified in the ICA or AppSrv file does
	not match an available screen resolution then only that amount
	of area is used, centered on the screen.

	<P>e.g. Specifying the size as <CODE>DesiredHRes=576</CODE>
	and <CODE>DesiredVRes=432</CODE> would cause the client to use
	a 640 by 480 screen mode with a 5% safe area border all round.

    </OL>

    <P>Note that the ICA client can <strong>not</strong> be used on a
    TV with a Model 1 NC or STB as <strong>no</strong> support for 16
    or 24 bit screen modes is implemented. A suitable error message is
    displayed when a session is started on these platforms.

    <H3><A NAME="errors">4.6 Error messages</A></H3>

    <P>Various errors are possible when initiating a connection. These
    all result in a standard RISC OS error box being displayed and the
    connection being aborted. Errors whilst in the Windows environment
    are in general ignored and an attempt to continue as best as
    possible is made.

    <P>The actual error messages are taken from the Citrix sources,
      modified where necessary to reflect the RISC OS environment.

    <P>A new filetype ICA (0xAD0) is allocated. This corresponds to the

    the ICA Client application, connecting immediately to the server
    given in the file.

    <h2> <a name="acceptance"> 9.0 Acceptance test </a> </h2>

    <H3>9.1 Acceptance criteria</H3>

    <P>Before allowing release of the software, the following conditions will be met;	

    <UL>
      <LI>The level of recorded unfixed faults in the Fault Database
      is deemed to be acceptable. No urgent or high priority bugs
      should be remaining.

      <LI>The majority of trial sites are operating successfully and
      are happy. This will be quantified using a check-list.

      <LI>The product audit is complete with an acceptable
      report. (Approx 4 man weeks audit time).

      <LI>Xemplar technical support specialists explicitly give the go
      ahead.
	
      <LI>Relevant Acorn SQA, Workstation and Consultancy
      representatives confirm its suitability for release on the
      available evidence.
    </UL>

    <P>Citrix currently have no requirement for any audit of the software.

    <H3>9.2 Performance Targets</H3>

    <P>The performance of ICA-3 is mostly independent of the
    implementation, and is governed by network access performance
    and server load.

    <P>However, it is important that our implementation performs as
    least as well as equivalent PC platforms, and that no additional
    bottlenecks are apparent.

    <P>From a user's perspective, a cluster of approximately 10
    clients accessing a server via an Ethernet network should feel
    close to the responsiveness of a low-medium performance PC running
    the applications natively. Over a modem connection, typical word
    processing type applications where response to keyboard and mouse
    activity is paramount, the system should be responsive and not
    suffer from significant delays caused by client porting
    architectural issues.

    <P>The following are the major differences between the RISC OS and

    <UL>
      <LI>Only runs full screen.
      <LI>Only runs one session at a time.
      <LI>Only supports TCP/IP transport.
      <LI>Doesn't include Compression Protocol Driver.
      <LI>Secure ICA add-on is not available.

	colours.
      <LI>No support for serial, clipboard or drive mapping virtual drivers.

    <P>The following are examples of Windows applications that will
      not work well with the client.

    <UL>
      <LI>Any program that bypasses the standard Windows drawing
      routines. eg one that directly accesses video memory or uses a
      interface such as OpenGL or DirectX.

    <h2> <a name="test"> 11.0 Development test strategy </a> </h2>

    <P>Initial development testing will utilise Acorn House WinFrame
    NT Servers running on the House Net. It may be advantageous to use
    a sub-net, in order that packet monitoring can be performed
    without being swamped by unrelated traffic.  It is hoped that it
    will not be necessary to use isolated servers and clients as the
    network layer will be largely unaffected. A PC running Citrix
    released code will be used as a comparison.
      
    <P>Testing of the product will make heavy use of trial sites, for
    it is the integration of the many components in a variety of
    different network environments that are the most difficult to
    predict and test. These sites will include Xemplar identified
    ones, other mixed school sites and other third parties where
    WinFrame products are in use. We may seek such reference sites
    from Citrix. Site visits to each of the major sites will be made
    to check the installation and operation of the software.

    <P>A formal audit of the software will be made, in conjunction
    with the explicit and directed testing that will be undertaken
    during the Beta phase of the project. Specifically, the Audit will
    also focus on 'out of the box' consistency and useability,
    software/documentation consistency, as well as reliability and
    functionality.
