	* General
 	
	Decided to start a Changelog for the WinFrame project for better
 	clarity in what work is being done.

	Today I sorted out a number of bugs in the full-screen text
 	mode. This is used when you open a DOS box and set it to full
 	screen. There is still the issue of setting the DOS code
 	page. Currently Acorn Latin1 is used so many characters come out
 	strange. A complication that will arise when this is fixed
 	properly is that we need to be able to display control characters.

	Fixed the mouse Y overflow bug.

	Moved some common functions to lib/clib/vdu.c, header in sys_inc.

	Previous problems
	-----------------

	1) Some plotting modes are not supported. This tends to affect the
	masking of small icons (eg menu ticks, the down arrow on popup list
	boxes etc.)

	This is fixed in 0.07

	2) The background colour in Word is wrong.

	Fixed in 0.09

	3) If the server cuts the connection for any reason the RISC OS
	screen mode is not restored.

	This is fixed in 0.07

	4) If you have to kill the software off with Alt-Break then you may
	find the next time you go in the keys don't work. In which case you
	must reboot.

	5) When you press the buttons on a the Windows Calculator the graphic
	goes strange.

	Fixed in 0.08

	6) If you run the application, run the nc-nt file, switch back to the 
	RISCOS desktop, choose disconnect from the menu and the run the nc-nt file
	again then the palette will be wrong and possibly worse problems may
	manifest.

	Fixed in 0.09
