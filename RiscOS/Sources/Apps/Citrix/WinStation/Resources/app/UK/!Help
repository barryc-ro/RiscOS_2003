ICA 3 Client for RISC OS
------------------------

This is an alpha release of the client. DO NOT DISTRIBUTE outside
Acorn or Xemplar. See bottom of file for copyright messages.

This client will connect to a WinFrame server using the ICA 3
protocol.

The following driver stack is implemented

  TCP/IP transport
  CRYPT1 encryption

The following virtual drivers are supported

  Thinwire 3.1

Note that the ICA file type, the application name and the icons are
all temporary.


Platforms
---------

This client has been tested on 

 - StrongARM RiscPC running RISC OS 3.70 over modem and ethernet.
 - NC Model1 running RISC OS NC2 over ethernet.

Currently it only supports 256 colour mode therefore a RiscPC or later
is requireed. It should run on RISC OS 3.5 although this hasn't been
tested.

16 colour mode will be added in the future allowing RISC OS 3.1
support.

Only 640x480 mode is implemented.
The persistent cache is not implemented.

Connecting
----------

To connect to a server prepare an ICA file (example provided) and run
in one of the following two ways.

Method 1:

 - Load the client software by double-clicking on !WSClient
 - Connect to a server by double-clicking on the ICA file
 - Return to the RISC OS desktop by pressing Shift F1 within Windows

 - Return to Windows desktop by clicking on the WSClient icon
   OR
 - Quit the WSClient from the iconbar menu.

Method 2:

 - Ensure the client has been booted
 - Double-click on the ICA file to load and run the client
 - Return to the RISC OS desktop by pressing Shift F1 within Windows
   The client will restore the Desktop and quit.

The advantage of method 2 is that it can easily be triggered from a
web page and it doesn't load any toolbox modules and so requires less
memory.



INI file
--------

The only INI file element that is worth changing currently is the
'WindowsCache' line in 'module.ini'. This specifies the size of the
client cache in 1K chunks. The default is 3072 which is suitable for a
RISC PC bbut probably too large forn NC. Currently the client doesn't
cope too well if there isn't enough memory.



Launching from a web page
-------------------------

 1) Add the following line to the MimeMap file.

--------------- cut here ---------------------
application/x-ica   ICA   1CA   .ica
--------------- cut here ---------------------

 2) Configure the web server with the equivalent mapping (consult
appropriate documentation for details).

 3) If using Fresco then add the following line to !Fresco.runables

--------------- cut here ---------------------
1CA
--------------- cut here ---------------------

If the runables file doesn't exist then create it with just those 3
characters contained within.

 4) Ensure that !WSClient is booted.

 5) If using NC2 ROMs then you must load WSClient:KeyWatch *before*
NCFresco starts. Otherwise NCFresco's detection of handset presses may
go wrong.

 6) Save the ICA file created earlier on your web server with the
extension .ica (and file type text if working over Acorn NFS) and
place a link to it on a web page.

You should find then that following the link will automatically launch
the ICA client. Shift F1 should then take you back to the web page.



Known bugs
----------

 1) Some plotting modes are not supported. This tends to affect the
masking of small icons (eg menu ticks, the down arrow on popup list
boxes etc.)

 2) The background colour in Word is wrong.

 3) If the server cuts the connection for any reason the RISC OS
screen mode is not restored.

 4) If you have to kill the software off with Alt-Break then you may
find the next time you go in the keys don't work. In which case you
must reboot.
