/* ----------------------------- dboxquery --------------------------------
 * Description:   Displays a dialogue box, with YES and NO buttons, and a 
 *                question, and gets reply.
 *
 * Parameters:    char *question -- the question to be asked
 * Returns:       reply by user.
 * Other Info:    Question can be up to 120 chars long, 3 lines of 40 chars
 *                RETURN will reply "yes"; ESCAPE or CLOSE event will
 *                reply "cancel". Note: a call of dbox_query(0), will
 *                reserve space for the dbox and return with no display
 *                This will mean that space is always available for
 *                important things like asking to quit!!
 *                The template for the dialogue box should have the following
 *                attributes:
 *                   window flags -- moveable, auto-redraw
 *                                   Also advisable to have a title icon
 *                                   containing the name of your program
 *                                   (or other suitable text)
 *                   icon #1 -- the message icon -- should have indirected
 *                                                  text flag set, with
 *                                                  buton type "never"
 *                   icon #0 -- the "YES" icon --   should be text icon
 *                                                  with text string set to
 *                                                  "YES"; button type should
 *                                                  be "menu icon"
 *                   icon #2 -- the "NO" icon  --   should be text icon
 *                                                  with text string set to
 *                                                  "NO"; button type should
