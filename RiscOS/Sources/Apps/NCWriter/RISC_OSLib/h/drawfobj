/* --------------------------- wr_draw_create_diag ----------------------------
 * Description:   Create an empty diagram (ie. just the file header), with
 *                a given bounding box.
 *
 * Parameters:    wr_draw_diag *diag -- pointer to store to hold diagram
 *                char *creator -- pointer to character string holding
 *                                 creator's name
 *                wr_draw_box bbox -- the bounding box (in Draw units).
 * Returns:       void.
 * Other Info:    diag must point at sufficient memory to hold the diagram.
 *                The first 12 chars of creator are stored in the file
 *                header. diag.length is set appropriately by this function.

 * Description:   Render a specified range of objects from a diagram.
 *
 * Parameters:    wr_draw_diag *diag -- the diagram
 *                wr_draw_object start -- start of range of objects to be
 *                                     rendered
 *                wr_draw_object end   -- end of range of objects to be rendered
 *                wr_draw_redrawstr *r -- WIMP-style redraw rectangle

 *                wr_draw_error *error -- possible error condition.
 * Returns:       TRUE if render was successful.
 * Other Info:    Parameters (except range) are used as in wr_draw_render_diag,
 *                in diagram level module.
 *                The diagram must be verified before a call to this function
 *                If the range of objects inclues text with anti-aliasing
 *                fonts, you MUST call wr_draw_setFontTable first.
 *                Very small (<0.00009) or negative scale factors will cause

 * Parameters:    wr_draw_diag *diag -- the diagram to be scanned.

 *                anti-aliasing fonts, but no font table object. The font

 *                wr_draw_error *error -- possible error condition.
 * Returns:       TRUE if object found and verified.
 * Other Info:    Verifying an object ensures that its bounding box is
 *                consistent with the data in it; if not, no error is
 *                reported, but the box is made consistent, On an error, the

 *                wr_draw_objectType newObject -- the created object

 *                inserting at the start/end of the diagram.
 *                Diagram must be large enough for the new data; its length
 *                field is updated.
 *                On an error, the location is not meaningful.

 *                otherwise.  This can cause the font reference numbers to

 *                wr_draw_translateText(), the font change will be applied (only
