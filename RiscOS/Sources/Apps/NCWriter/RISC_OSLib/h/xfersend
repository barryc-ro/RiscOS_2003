 * Other Info:    Note: Your sendproc will be called by functions in the

/*************************** LIBRARY FUNCTIONS *****************************/


/* ----------------------------- xfersend ----------------------------------
 * Description:   Allows the user to export application data, by icon drag.
 *
 * Parameters:    int filetype -- type of file to save to
 *                char *name -- suggested file name
 *                int estsize -- estimated size of the file
 *                wr_xfersend_saveproc -- caller-supplied function for saving
 *                                     application data to a file
 *                wr_xfersend_sendproc -- caller-supplied function for in-core
 *                                     data transfer (if application is able
 *                                     to do this)
 *                wr_xfersend_printproc -- caller-supplied function for printing
 *                                      application data, if "icon" is
 *                                      dragged onto printer application
 *                wr_wimp_eventstr *e --  the event which started the export
 *                                     (usually mouse drag)
 *                void *handle -- handle to be passed to handler functions.
 * Returns:       TRUE if data exported successfully.
 * Other Info:    You should typically call this function in a window's
 *                event handler, when you get a "mouse drag" event.
 *                See the "saveas.c" code for an example of this.
 *                xfersend deals with the complexities of message-passing
 *                protocols to achieve the data transfer. Refer to the above
 *                typedefs for an explanation of what the three 
 *                caller-supplied functions should do.
 *                If "name" is 0 then a default name of "Selection" is
 *                supplied.
 *                If you pass 0 as the wr_xfersend_sendproc, then no in-core
 *                data transfer will be attempted
 *                If you pass 0 as the wr_xfersend_printproc, then the file
 *                format for printing is assumed to be the same as for saving
 *                The estimated file size is not essential, but may improve
 *                performance.

/* ----------------------------- wr_xfersend_pipe ------------------------------
 * Description:   Allows the user to export application data, without an

 * Other Info:    This function works similarly to xfersend, except it is
 *                not normally used as the result of an icon drag.
 *                Typical use may be to export data to another application
 *                (using the same technique as xfersend), following a
 *                request for data from that application (maybe as a result
