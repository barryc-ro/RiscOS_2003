This demonstration version of NCWriter allows you to
create, edit and print documents containing text and
graphic images. It includes a point and click tool bar
for simple editing.

NCWriter is fully WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get)
complete with page margins. More than one document can be
open for editing at the same time.

Selected text can be moved or copied within the same
document, to a different NCWriter document, or to other
suitable applications running on the computer, in a
number of different file formats.

Graphic images can be imported from !Draw and !Paint. CSV
files produced by most spreadsheet programs are
automatically formatted as tables.

Text attributes, including font, text size and color can
be applied to the whole or selected parts of the document.
Similarly, selected words or phrases can be marked as
index entries, from which an alphabetically sorted index
can be generated including page numbers of the references.

Typographical features, such as footnotes, running headers
and footers (which can be individually specified for left
and right pages), paragraph indentation, hyphenation and
kerning are simply set up using NCWriter.

If required, the text can be structured as chapters,
sections, tables and lists, to which style attributes can
be individually or collectively applied. A table of
contents can also be generated using this information.

Other facilities which are available in NCWriter include
automatic numbering of lists, bookmarks, êsmartë quotes
and extra printing options, such as crop marks, scaling
and pamphlet layout.

This demonstration version shows all the facilities of
NCWriter, but does not permit saving or exporting files.
Also spell checking is inactivated as the spelling
dictionary is not on the demonstration disc.
