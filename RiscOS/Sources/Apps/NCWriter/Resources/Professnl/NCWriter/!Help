The NCWriter application allows you to create, edit and
print documents containing text and graphic images. It
includes a point and click tool bar for simple editing.

NCWriter is fully WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get)
complete with page margins.

Selected text can be moved or copied within the document
and text attributes, including font, text size and color can
be applied to the whole or selected parts of the document.
