The NCWriter application allows you to create, edit and
print documents containing text and graphic images. More
than one document can be open at the same time.

Selected text can be moved or copied within the same
document or to a different NCWriter document.

Text attributes, including font, text size and color can
be applied to the whole or selected parts of the document.

If required, the text can be structured as chapters,
section, tables and lists, to which style attributes can
be applied.

Graphic images can be imported from Draw and Paint.
