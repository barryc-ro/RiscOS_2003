Known bugs in Misc CSE
----------------------

1  MFC  27-Jul-94  -  COMMENT

The spec for the Scale object describes the min, max and step values as
"alternatives" to the defaults - but does not say how to define the defaults.
ResEd does not treat these as alternatives. This problem also arises with
initial height and aspect ratio for fonts in the Font Dbox.

2  MFC  27-Jul-94  -  FIXED

At present, Misc makes no attempt to determine whether any changes have
really been made when the user clicks on OK - instead, it assumes always that
changes *have* occurred. Can this be improved upon?

3  DH  29-Jul-94  -  FIXED

Default values inside the Scale dbox are not in accord with those given in
the specification.

4  DH  29-Jul-94  -  FIXED

In the "Saveas" dbox, the "Supports RAM transfers" opticon should be faded
if the "Client participates" button is off.

5  MFC 18-Aug-94  -  FIXED

The "priority" icon should be faded in the Iconbar properties dbox unless the
"position" icon has a value between -8 and -5 inclusive.

6  MFC 30-Aug-94  -  FIXED

If an "Other" filetype is set (for a FileInfo or Saveas object) by
adjust-click on "Set", then the Filetype dbox and menu stay open, but the
menu is no longer ticked properly.

7  MFC 01-Sep-94  -  TRANSFERRED

ADJ/click on the Cancel icon in the Colour Picker does not reset it.

This is a ColourPicker bug, and has been registered in the Medusa faults
database.

8  MFC 02-Sep-94  -  FIXED

The default title length can be reset to zero again, now that the Toolbox
modules will behave sensibly in this case.

9  DH  08-Sep-94  -  UNREPRO

Has experienced (recoverable) errors when using the pop-up colour menu to
choose the initial colour for a ColourMenu object.

10 TR  12-Sep-94  -  FIXED

Default "try string" for FontDbox should read "jumps" not "jumped".
