Each component directory includes three makefiles:

  Makefile  - is the real make file
  Makefile0 - is the previous version of the real make file
  MakeProto - is the "prototype" for the real make file

There is also a master makefile at the top level - !ResEd.Makefile - which
calls each of the subsidiary ones in order to make a complete build.


When changes need to be made to a makefile for a component, it is the
prototype which should be edited, *not* the real make file; a new version of
the real make file is then made using "amu -f MakeProto depend".

Adding a new source file is easy: simply add its name to the CFILES and
OFILES lists.


The following options are available when one of the five component
directories is the CSD:

  amu
    To build the component.

  amu CFLAGS=-ff
    To build the component without function names embedded in the code.

  amu clean
    To remove all derived files from the component.

  amu -f MakeProto depend
    To create a new "real" makefile which includes computed dependencies.

  amu install PROGDIR=<directory-name>
    To install !ResEd in the given directory.


The following analogous options are available when !ResEd itself is the CSD:

  amu
  amu CFLAGS=-ff
  amu clean
  amu depend
  amu install INSTDIR=<directory-name>
