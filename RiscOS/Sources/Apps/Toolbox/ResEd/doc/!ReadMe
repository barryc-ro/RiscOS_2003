The overall directory structure of the !ResEd application is described in
the Overview functional specification (aquarius.fnspecs.Overview); it
contains four component applications:

  The shell:  see shell
  !Menu:      see CSE.!Menu
  !Misc:      see CSE.!Misc
  !Window:    see CSE.!Window

These applications all make use of a library called commonlib whose source
is held in the directory common.

Each of these five directories (shell, !Menu, !Misc, !Window, common)
contains its own doc directory in which at least two files will be found:

  bugs      -  which is an early (pre-beta) bug list; this is now mostly of
               historical interest only, although some of the discussion may
               be of interest when considering future iterations of the
               product.

  implnotes -  which contains a series of (usually disconnected) notes on
               sundry implementation topics; note that !Window.doc.implnotes
               is by far the largest, and contains information of relevance
               to all of the components.

This doc directory contains the following files:

  code-stand - notes on Steve's source coding standards, and on the use of
               the change log and SrcFiler.

  dboxguide  - these are the rules that Matt Hammond used to create the
               original dilaogue box templates; there are also notes on
               which template editor to use if changes have to be made.

  issues     - mostly a historical document.

  plan       - entirely a historical document, retained for amusement only.

  strflds    - which discusses and attempts to define the various kinds of
               string field which appear within the Toolbox; this may no
               longer be entirely accurate, but might serve as a warning to
               future designers/programmers: defining clearly the difference
               between NULL and empty strings early on in a project can save
               a lot of time (and bugs!) later on.

  makefiles  - a note on the way makefiles are used

  implnotes  - miscellaneous implementation notes that apply to all the
               components of ResEd
