The ResEd application allows you to create and edit resource files for use by
Acorn C/C++ Toolbox tasks.

ResEd is an extensible application that consists of a shell together with a
number of other applications, each responsible for editing object templates
of certain classes. These applications can be found in the CSE directory
inside the ResEd application: 

  * double-click on the !ResEd icon in a directory viewer while holding the
    SHIFT key down;
  * double-click on the CSE directory icon to display a directory viewer
    containing the applications.

Each application includes its own !Help file which holds information about
the object classes that it is capable of editing.


Version information for the shell:

  This is version 0.42 of ResEd.

  Object templates from resource files with version numbers 100 or 101 can be
  loaded into this version of ResEd.

  This version of ResEd always saves resource files with version number 101.
