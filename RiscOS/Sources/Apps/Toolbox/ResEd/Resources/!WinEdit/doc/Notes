Filer-like windows
------------------

Min size of 1x1 grid, in the window definition.
Visarea in template -> biggest size window will grow to by itself.
Work area width in template -> widest width user can drag it to.

Ought to reset certain things on mode change (eg never let windows
be bigger than screen).

User drags: don't let visarea width get > grid width.
