   The image map row of buttons on the left hand side of the screen
   doesn't seem to work.

   This page is layed out incorrectly and the middle section is missing.

  http://www.fco.gov.uk/reference/travel_advice/frames_index.htm

   Is supposed to be a frames document - but the frames don't display.

   Not serious, but the stars after 'Twister' don't remove the image 
   question mark properly until you scroll the screen.

Hope this helps.

 The following where found using Fresco on a RISC PC 32K colours (1024x768).

  Goto the new car search. The search options are all set to <Any>, clicking on
  another manufacture eg. Ford will change the value to <Many>. On Explorer it
  delects <Any> and highlights <Ford>. To make multiple selections you use <SHIFT>
  click. - shouldn't Fresco do this ?

  One of those table bugs... The Please visit our sponser image at the bottom of the
  page should be centered between the other two images.

  Strange one this one.... The page loads okay but the 'Image fetching complete'
  message at the bottom of the screen keeps redrawing itself !

  Those tables again.... The table near the top of the page should display five
  months (Jun, Jul, Sep, Oct, and Nov) and the next row should be (Blank, Other E,
  Box Office, Home Page, Blank).

owen

The Acorn Rounders page (http://chaos.org.uk/~dean/rounders.html) fails on
!Fresco version "1.20 (30-Jul-96 (1915)) R".

It reports a fatal internal error (type=1) and exits immediately.

I enclose the Errors file it generated.

By the way, the page used to work.
