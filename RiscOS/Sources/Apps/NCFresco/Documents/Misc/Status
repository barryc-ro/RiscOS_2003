Backend calls whilst downloading 


frontend_view_status() 
  with codes

  sb_status_FETCHED
  sb_status_IMAGE
  sb_status_PROGRESS
  sb_status_ABORT
  
and 

  frontend_view_visit()

At doc_complete we get a PROGRESS then a visit() if we haven't had one
then we will get IMAGE calls till the end.

Any of them could be the end of download
