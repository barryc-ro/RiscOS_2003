Meta
----
  We support two uses of the META tag
  
  1) eg <META HTTP-EQUIV="Refresh" CONTENT="30; newpage.html">
for loading a new page after an interval (30 seconds here)

  2) <META NAME="BrowserMode" CONTENT="Desktop"> to disable the tool bar
whilst displaying this page.

Cookies
-------

Some testing of cookies needs to be done. These are not visible by
themselves and so require CGI scripts on a server to test setting and
removing and sending them and also to generate pages for the browser to
display showing the results of these tests,

Mistakes
--------
 <INPUT> TYPE=REST should be TYPE=RESET
 <FRAMES> should be <FRAME>

Priority
--------

Tables are a priority for testing. In particular it may be worth going to 
an extra level of nesting in checking them.

Testing needs to be tried both loading files locally and over an http 
transport - preferably with a modem. Progressive rendering means that
different bugs can show up when a file is loaded over a slow link as
over a fast link.
