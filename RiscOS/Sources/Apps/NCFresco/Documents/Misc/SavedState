Saved state information
-----------------------

Currently we have a problem in that the only saved state about a page is the
scroll offset when you leave it. The major lack of state saved is the contents
of any FORM fields.

A general method for solving this, which may have a number of uses, is to
define two new object methods - 'write_state' and 'read_state'.

These would save and reload state in some succinct fashion.

There are a number of questions.

 - Should this in information be saved in memory or on disc? 
 
Bearing in mind that two different windows may access the same page and
should have their own saved state.

Also that for security reasons you may not want state to be kept across 
sessions.

 - In what format do we store the data?
 
 - Can we make it robust enough to cope with possibly reloading the page
with different conditions (eg an OBJECT tag where the plugin has been found
between one load and the next - thus changing the parsing for later objects).
