Global history
--------------

Store all pages without fragment ids. 
Possibly in alphabetical order of title.
Possibly sorted into schemes.
No scroll offsets.

View history
------------

Store pages and fragment jumps in the order that you come
across them.

Don't weed out any duplicates.

Visited
-------

We need a separate list of URL's with fragment ids that we have visited.

A link counts as visited if it is in the cache (if there is no 
fragment id) or in the history list.

Frames
------

We need to store the information about all open frames.
So for each frame we need URL and scroll offset.
