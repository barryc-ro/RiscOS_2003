To get to 3.2 we need to do the following

These tags are being added anyway
 APPLET (we'll be doing this once Java is working)
 IMG ALIGN=LEFT|RIGHT
 BR CLEAR

These were asked for by Oracle and I putin yesterday.
 SUB
 SUP
 
These are new tags
 STRIKE
 BIG
 SMALL
 DIV ALIGN=LEFT|CENTER|RIGHT
 SCRIPT (just optout)
 STYLE (just optout)

These are new attributes to existing tags
 FONT COLOR
 FONT FACE
 P ALIGN=LEFT|CENTER|RIGHT
 H ALIGN=LEFT|CENTER|RIGHT
 OL START
 UL TYPE
 LI VALUE
 HR ALIGN, NOSHADE, SIZE, WIDTH
 color names

I don't think anything there is too complicated or controversial.

Simon.
