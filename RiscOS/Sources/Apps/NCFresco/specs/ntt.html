    <h2> <a name="overview"> 1.0 Overview </a> </h2>

    <P> This document contains the software functional specification for
      the Web browser included in the system ROM of the 
      STB VE II <A HREF="#cis">[1]</A>.

    <P>This document only describes changes from the version of the
      browser included in Acorn NC2 ROM <A
	HREF="#nc2">[2]</A>. Specifications for the previous versions of
      the browser may be of interest <A HREF="#rca116">[3]</A>, <A
	HREF="#rca115">[4]</A> <A HREF="#model1">[5]</A>

    <P>The baseline specification for the HTML implementation is
      HTML 3.2 <A HREF="#html32">[6]</A> although some elements from
      its successor, HTML 4 <A HREF="#html40">[7]</A>, have been implemented.

    <P>Italicised text is used where issues are still to be decided
      or where contents are liable to change.

    <P>

      <!-- ======================================================================= -->

    <hr  noshade>
    <h2> <a name="outstanding"> 2.0 Outstanding issues </a> </h2>

    <P>There are no outstanding issues.

    <P>
      <!-- ======================================================================= -->

    <hr  noshade>
    <h2> <a name="technical"> 3.0 Technical background </a> </h2>

    <P>The browser for the STB VE II is largely the same as that
      included in Acorn NC2 with the addition of 16 bit font support. It
      also incorporates various minor bug fixes introduced since the NC2
      release.

    <P>The following changes are made to the internals of the browser
      to support the introduction of 16bit fonts.

    <H3>3.1 Determining encoding </H3>

    <P>The encoding used is found from the following sources (in
      this order).
    <OL>
      <LI>Encoding set by the user (if the override option is set)

      <LI><TT>charset</TT> parameter to the <TT>Content-Type</TT>
	HTTP header

      <LI><TT>charset</TT> parameter to the <TT>Content-Type</TT>
	META tag within the document

      <LI>Encoding set by the user (if the override option is not
	set)
    </OL>

    <H3>3.2 Auto detecting encoding </H3>

    <P>Auto detection code is used to detect which of a limited number
      of character sets is in use in a document. For this project it
      is only used to detect which of JIS, Shift-JIS and EUC
      encodings are in use.

    <P>The auto detection algorithm is applied to characters before
      they pass through the encoding code. After a character is received
      then the algorithm can be in one of four states.

    <OL>
      <LI>A definite decision on which encoding is in being used can
	be made - pass text to appropriate utf8 encoder.
      <LI>No part of a valid japanese character stream has been
	received - pass text to ASCII to utf8 encoder.
      <LI>The encoding is either EUC or SJIS but no decision can be
	made as to which - hold text in buffer.
      <LI>The last character has been received and it is either EUC or
	SJIS - pass held text through as SJIS.
    </OL>

    <P>The actual algorithm used is as described in <CITE>Understanding
	Japanese Information Processing</CITE>.

      <!--
    <P>The auto detection code is applied before the character data is
      converted to Unicode and passed to the parser. The data fetched is
      kept in the cache until the encoding is determined at which point
      parsing starts as normal.

    <P>The rules for determining the character encoding are as follows

    <UL>
    <LI>If an escape character (character 17) is detected then the
      encoding must be JIS.

    <LI>If the sequence top bit clear, top bit set, top bit clear is
      detected then the encoding must be Shift-JIS.

    <LI>If neither of these patterns appear within a specified
      number of bytes (specified in the Config file as
    <VAR>encoding.autodetect.limit</VAR> and defaulting to 1024
      bytes) then the encoding is assumed to be EUC.
    </UL>
      -->

    <H3>3.3 Parser input</H3>

    <OL>
      <LI>Input to the parser is translated into UTF-8 and the
	original encoding recorded.  

      <LI>Character entities are decoded into the appropriate UTF-8
	characters.

      <LI>Numeric entities are treated as Unicode character
	numbers.

      <LI>The existing code for translating the character codes in the
	undefined region of the Latin-1 character set to allow them to
	be displayed as expected by users is removed. This translation
	is handled by the input mapping files instead.

    </OL>

    <H3>3.4 Word parsing</H3>

    <P>The parser outputs a stream of words. A word being defined as a
      group of characters which have no change in style (eg font size or
      colour) within them and which cannot be split up when determining
      line breaks. 

    <P>For Latin 1 only use this parser used the space character to
      determine word breaks. In the context of a Unicode character
      stream this is more complicated. Characters are classed into one
      of a number of groups. 

    <UL>
      <LI>Paragraph and line separators
      <LI>Spaces
      <LI>Non breaking spaces
      <LI>Letters, numbers, dash punctuation, currency and math symbols
      <LI>Ideographic characters
      <LI>Opening punctuation
      <LI>Closing and other punctuation
    </UL>

    <P>The rules for breaking are 
    <UL>
      <LI>Break after paragraph separators
      <LI>Break after spaces
      <LI>Break after ideographs unless followed by closing punctuation
      <LI>Break before ideographs unless preceded by opening
	punctuation
    </UL>


    <H3>3.5 Display code changes</H3>

    <P>All text display routines are modified to assume UTF-8
      encoding. This includes
    <UL>
      <LI>Page text
      <LI>ALT text
      <LI>Menus
      <LI>Menu display fields
      <LI>Buttons
      <LI>Writeable fields
    </UL>

    <P>The display routines can switch fonts so that Latin text can
      still have bold and italic styles applied to it and can be plotted
      in both proportional and monospaced fonts. Each word has a style
      bit associated with it that says whether the text within includes
      characters only from within the Latin1 set - in which case it is
      plotted using the configured font, or outside - in which case it
      is plotted using the configured wide font.    

      
    <H3>3.6 Text output</H3>

    <P>Output from forms (GET or POST) is translated back to the
      required encoding before being sent to the server. 

    <P>The ACCEPT-CHARSET attribute to the FORM element is used to
      determine the encoding to be used. If this attribute is not
      present then the original document encoding is used.
    <P>

    <h2> <a name="user"> 4.0 User interface </a> </h2>

    <P>The base user interface presented is that created for
      Acorn NC2 and described in the Acorn NC2 CIS <A
	HREF="#nc2_cis">[8]</A>. 

    <h3> 4.1 Options </h3>

    <P>Due to the lack of extended NVRAM space in the STB the full
    Options interface described in the NC2 CIS is not included.  The
    following choices available on the screen opened by the Options
    button on the toolbar.

    <H4> 4.1.2 Font screen </H4>

    <P>Two options are available:

    <P>The first option is the default character encoding to be
      used. This is presented as a popup menu box.

    <DL>
      <DT><B>Which character encoding do you wish to use?</B>
      <DD>

	  <LI>JIS
	  <LI>Shift-JIS
	  <LI>EUC
	</UL>
    </DL>

    <P>The second option is whether the choice above is used only if
      the encoding cannot be determined by another means or all the
      time. This is presented as a pair of radio buttons.

    <DL>
      <DT><B>Do you wish to override the encoding given by the server or
	web page?</B>
      <DD>
	<UL>
	  <LI>Yes
	  <LI>No
	</UL>
    </DL>

    <P>If Yes is selected then the configured encoding is always
      used. If No then that encoding is only used if there is nothing
      specified in the HTTP headers or META tags.
    <P>

    <H4> 4.1.3 Copyright screen</H4>

    <P>This page displays copyright and acknowledgement messages.

    <H4> 4.1.4 Other screens</H4>

    <h3> 4.2 Notes </h3>

    <P>All messages and screens are presented in English as in NC2.
      No translation is performed.

    <P>No processing is performed on user input. Characters are
      accepted as entered and the resulting character stream interpreted
      as UTF-8.
