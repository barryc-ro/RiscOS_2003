      <h2> <a name="overview"> 1.0 Overview </a> </h2>

      <P> This document contains the software functional specification for
	the Web browser included in the system ROM of the NC100
	Network Computer.

      <P>Italicised text is used where issues are still to be decided
	or where contents are liable to change.

      <h2> <a name="technical"> 3.0 Technical background </a> </h2>

      <P>The browser for the NC100 is a further development of
	NCBrowser created for the NC&nbsp;OS 1.0 project from the ANT Ltd
	browser Fresco&reg;. This document describes only new work and
	bug fixes planned for the NC100/101 browser and not, except where
	necessary, existing behaviour. See the <A
	  HREF="#previous_version">previous specification</A>
	referenced in section 15 for more 
	details. 

      <P>This work consists of some new features and fixing of
	many deferred bugs. This spec lists exactly what will be
	done and what won't be done in this release. Any faults or
	features not explicitly mentioned should be assumed to be still
	deferred. 

      <P>The changes to existing features described here are mostly
      controlled by items in the browser Config file. Therefore each
      feature can be configured to behave as described here or as the
      existing behaviour in Model 1. However the browser has not been
      tested in Model 1 configuration and so this behaviour cannot be
      relied upon.

      <h3><A NAME="tables">1) Rework tables</a></h3>

      <P>Tables reworking divides up into three components.

      <OL TYPE=a>
	<LI><A HREF="#parser">Parser enhancements</a>
	<LI><A HREF="#floats">Floating object handling</a>
	<LI><A HREF="#tablewidths">Enhancements to table width constraint algorithms</a>
      </OL>

      <h4><A NAME="parser">1.1) Parser enhancements</A></h4>

      <p>Storing different classes of markup information separately
	allows the parser to better cope with badly nested markup. This
	prevents errors in, for example, marking a link from affecting
	where a table cell ends.


      <h4><A NAME="floats">1.2) Floating object handling</A></h4>

      <P>The handling of floating objects (images or tables where the
	attribute ALIGN=LEFT or ALIGN=RIGHT were used) had a number of
	bugs in Model 1. These bugs tended to interact with the
	table formatting to cause more serious layout problems. A
	rework of some components of the formatter fixes this.


      <h4><A NAME="tablewidths">1.3) Enhancements to table width constraint algorithms</a></h4>

      <P>
	The enhancements to table formatting are designed to cope with
	over constrained and under constrained table specifications (both can
	easily occur simultaneously), providing a structured approach to which
	pieces of a tables specification to ignore and a mechanism to
	deduce missing constraint information. Further, a mechanism is provided
	for possibly ignoring table constraint values when they lead to a table
	formatting wider than the screen.

      <p>
	Perfect Netscape compatibility may not be achieved for a
	number of reasons. Firstly, there are multiple versions of Netscape in
	the field. Secondly, Netscape only makes a passing attempt at
	implementing the tables specification. Thirdly, Netscape has notable
	bugs in its implementation. Attempting to precisely replicate a bug from
	a particular Netscape version is a resource expensive exercise that is
	worse than worthless the instant Netscape fix the bug.

      <P>

      <h3><A NAME="rendering">2) Rendering</A></h3>

      <P>Various improvements are made to the rendering of a page to
	reduce the number of redraws and amount of flickering and
	twittering. These break down into changes to

      <OL TYPE=a>
	<LI><a href="#imagerender">Image rendering</a>
	<LI><a href="#formatter">Formatter</a>
      </OL>


      <H4><a name="imagerender">2.1) Image rendering</a></h4>

      <P>The image handling code is extended to be able to handle
	objects that are not converted to the internal Sprite format
	before plotting. This allows JPEGs to be optionally plotted
	with the OS code and also gives DrawFile support.

      <h5>2.1.1) JPEG</h5>

      <P>A configuration option (not user configurable) specifies
	whether JPEGs should be decompressed on loading or plotted from
	the compressed form using the OS JPEG code. 

      <P>Although the OS JPEG code has several advantages:-
      <UL>
	<LI>much lower memory requirements 
	<LI>faster decompression
      </UL>

      <P>It also has some limitations 
      <UL>
	<LI>The dithering quality in 8 bit modes is lower
	<LI>The time to redraw a page is longer, noticeably
	  longer in 8 bit modes, and very noticeable on a ARM 7500
	  machine. 
	<LI>Progressive-mode JPEGs are not supported (as used
	  on at least msnbc.com).
	<LI>Images without a JFIF header are not supported.
	<LI>No image data is displayed until the whole file has
	  downloaded. 
      </UL>

      <P>Therefore the default is to use OS JPEG code. However the
      JPEG is always partially scanned by the existing code and if it
      is progressive-mode or has no JFIF header then the existing code
      decompresses the image and the OS JPEG code is not used.

      <P>User testing will show whether not seeing any image until
	download is finished is acceptable. If not then the use of the
	OS JPEG code can be disabled, or made dependent on whether a
	modem is being used, without code changes.

      <h5>2.1.2) GIF</h5>

      <P>Improvements are made to the updating of interlaced
      transparent GIFs to reduce the twitter affect that occurs as
      they download. 
	
      <h5>2.1.3) Animated GIFs</h5>

      <P>Outstanding faults in handling of animated gifs are fixed.

      <h5>2.1.4) PNG</h5>

      <P>No further work is planned on PNG. Gamma correction is not
	supported.

      <h5>2.1.5) DrawFile</h5>

      <P>DrawFile is a proprietary Acorn vector format and so is very
	compact at describing certain types of images. It is supported
	in IMG SRC and BODY BACKGROUND attributes, no special file
	extension or mime type is needed. The changes to support OS
	JPEG plotting allow DrawFile support at minimal cost.

      <h5>2.1.6) Image sizing</h5>

      <P>The code that handles fetching and opening images is tuned to
	get the dimensions of images that are not specified in the HTML
	at a higher priority than fetching the image data. 

      <P>The constructs &lt;IMG WIDTH=xx%&gt; and &lt;IMG
	HEIGHT=xx%&gt;, not available in Model 1, are now
	implemented. These allow the display size of an image to be
	specified as a percentage of their parent element (ie table
	cell, frame or screen).

      <h5>2.1.7) Backgrounds</h5>

      <P>The fetching code gives highest priority to fetching any
	background tile image. This reduces the number of redraws that
	occur if the background image can be fetched before any of the
	foreground is drawn. If there is a delay in fetching the
	background image then the foreground is displayed anyway and the
	page is redrawn when the background does arrive. The delay time
	is configurable (but not by the user). The default value will be
	determined experimentally.

      <H4><A NAME="formatter">2.2) Formatter</A></h4>

      <P>The formatter is tuned to pass formatted markup through
	for display less often than in Model 1 and to not request
	a redraw if it is known that the whole page will have to be
	reformatted again afterwards.

      <P>The situations where it redraws a whole table unnecessarily
	because it didn't actually need reformatting are optimised out.

      <P>

      <h3><A NAME="renderingperformance">3) Rendering performance</a></h3>

      <h4><A NAME="fastercache">3.1) Loading from cache</a></h4>

      <P>Investigations will be made into how the performance of
	loading pages from cache can be improved.

      <P>An apparent improvement can be seen by displaying the page
	progressively as it is when initially downloaded rather than
	waiting for the whole page, and all the images, to be loaded
	as occurs in Model 1. With the other changes made this will 
	occur without reformatting being necessary.

      <h4><A NAME="keepalive">3.2) HTTP Keep-Alive</A></h4>

      <P>HTTP Keep-Alive is a feature from <A HREF="#http">HTTP</a>
	1.1 that allows one TCP connection to carry several HTTP
	streams in succession. ie as one finishes a new stream can
	start up using the same socket, thus saving the overheads of
	opening a new socket for each stream. It is implemented by all
	the other major browsers and supported by most servers and can
	give up to 50% improvement in overall download speed,
	especially where there are many images on a page.

      <P>

      <hr width="30%" noshade>

      <h3>4) <A NAME="pics">Parental control</a></h3> 

      <P>No parental control mechanism is implemented in the
	browser. A service provider that wishes to implement access
	control can use a product like <A
	  HREF="#surfwatch">SurfWatch</a>. This is an access control
	system that works outside the browser. On a Windows PC then it
	works at the IP stack level. It can also be installed as part of
	an HTTP proxy. In this case as long as the browser is configured
	to use this proxy for all requests then all unsuitable material
	is filtered out before reaching the NC.

      <P>Proxy support is provided in the browser.

      <h3><A NAME="navigation">5) 2D navigation</a></h3>

      <h4>5.1) Highlight display</h4>

      <h5>5.1.1) Highlightable items</h5>

      <P>Highlightable items are
      <UL>
	<LI>Links around text
	<LI>Links around images
	<LI>Client-side imagemaps
	<LI>Server-side imagemaps
	<LI>Form INPUT items
	<LI>Form TEXTAREA items
	<LI>Form SELECT items
	<LI>Embedded objects (plugin items)
	<LI>Frames
      </UL>

      <h5>5.1.2) Highlight marking</h5>

      <P>The highlight is usually drawn as a box around the item.
      The exceptions to this are

      <UL>
	<LI>INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT where an image can be defined to be
	displayed when highlighted (see new HTML) or the background 
	changes colour.

	<LI>SELECT, where the background changes colour.

	<LI>INPUT TYPE=RADIO and TYPE=CHECKBOX where if suitable
	sprites are found in the browser or wimp sprite area they will
	be used instead of drawing a highlight. The full set of
	sprites used are as follows.
	<TABLE BORDER=1>
	  <TR><TD ROWSPAN=2><TH COLSPAN=2>CHECKBOX<TH COLSPAN=2>RADIO
		  <TR><TD>unchecked<TD>checked<TD>unchecked<TD>checked

	</TABLE>
      </UL>

      <h5>5.1.3) Activating Highlighted item</h5>

      <P>When the highlight is around an item then pressing enter or select
	activates the item in some way as follows.

      <DL>
	<DT>Writeable item (INPUT TEXT, INPUT PASSWORD, TEXTAREA) 

	<DD>The highlight is removed and the caret is placed in the
	  item. When the caret is moved outside the item then the caret
	  is removed and a highlight placed on the next or previous
	  item. The caret is taken outside a TEXTAREA by moving up from
	  the top line or down from the bottom line. If a keyboard is
	  not being used then the on screen keyboard is opened.

	  <P>If the writeable item is not fully on screen when the caret
	    is placed in it then the screen is scrolled to bring it all on
	    screen (or as much as possible if it is bigger than the screen).

	<DT>Imagemap or INPUT IMAGE
	<DD>The mouse pointer turns into cross-hairs and can be moved
	  around the map using the cursor keys. A second press of enter
	  selects that point as if clicked on by the mouse. Escape
	  cancels map mode and return the cursor keys to their usual
	  behaviour. Moving the pointer outside the imagemap will also
	  leave map mode and move the highlight to the nearest
	  highlightable item.

	<DT>INPUT RADIO, CHECKBOX, SUBMIT
	<DD>The selected item is activated as if clicked on with the mouse.

	<DT>SELECT
	<DD>The menu is popped up. The up and down and page up
	  and down keys move the highlight through the options
	  scrolling the menu as necessary. Enter selects an item,
	  deselecting any others selected. The left or right cursor keys 
	  toggle the selection state of an item without affecting any
	  other selections. Escape closes the menu and return the
	  cursor keys to their normal state.

	<DT>Plugin
	<DD>The input focus is placed in the plugin window by means of
	  the plugin protocol. The plugin <strong>must</strong> then provide
	  a keyboard based means of returning the input focus to the browser.

      </DL>

      <h4>5.2) Highlight movement</h4>

      <h5>5.2.1) Model 1</h5>

      <P>In Model 1 the navigation of links by the keyboard used the
	following algorithm. Only the up and down keys moved the
	highlight. If the page were scrolled by other means then the
	highlight was kept on the screen by moving it to a new item
	just on screen.

      <UL>
	<LI>All the items on a page were organised into one logical
	  stream. Moving the highlight forward (or backwards) moved to
	  the next (or previous) item in the stream that was visible
	  on the page. This meant that items in the stream would be
	  skipped if there were more items on the screen further down
	  the stream.

	<LI>If no item could be found then the page was scrolled by
	  one line and the highlight moved if a new item appeared.

	<LI>If the page could not be scrolled then the highlight was
	  moved to the first item in the next frame.

	<LI>If there was no next frame then a beep was made and the
	  highlight didn't move.
      </UL>

      <h5>5.2.2) NC100</h5>

      <P>For NC100 this is modified to allow all four cursor keys
	to move the link in their respective directions. 

      <P>See the description in the CIS for more details.
<!--
      <P>The following rules are used for determining the link to move
	to.

      <P>When the left or right cursor keys are pressed then the page
	is scanned horizontally from a point on the page a 
	distance below the top of the currently highlighted item. This
	distance is half the value of the smaller of 
      <OL>
	<LI>the height of the highlighted item
	<LI>the height of a line of text at the default size.
      </OL>

      <P>If a suitable item is found then it is highlighted. Otherwise,
	the scan continues from the opposite side of the screen at the
	height of the bottom of the currently highlighted item.

      <P>If continuing the scan means going off screen then the
	same action as would be performed when the up or down keys are
	pressed is taken.

      <P>When the up or down cursor keys are pressed then the page is
	scanned vertically from the centre of the currently
	highlighted item. If an item is found then it is highlighted,
	otherwise the action depends on which key is used.

      <P>If the up key was used then the page is scrolled by half a
	screen and the scan continues. If an item can be highlighted
	then it is otherwise the highlight is left on the previous
	item. If the previous item has gone off screen then no item is
	highlighted.

      <P>If the down key was used then the highlight is moved off the
	page onto the up/down indicator on the toolbar. Further
	presses of the down key will scroll the page. Pressing the up
	key will move the highlight back onto the page.

      <P>If the page contains frames then the same approach as above
	is used with the following modifications.

      <UL>
	<LI>The entire page is considered when scanning for items. No
	  automatic scrolling of individual frames is performed except
	  for when using the up key in a frame that touches the top
	  edge of the screen or the down key when in the toolbar

	<LI>When moving to the toolbar the frame left is highlighted
	  by use of an outline.

	<LI>To scroll a frame the scroll up and down buttons must be
	  used. 

	<LI>If no suitable items are visible in a frame then the
	  frame itself is considered a highlightable item and is given
	  an outline (actually drawn just inside the frame border) and
	  the input focus.
      </UL>

      <h3><A NAME="autofit">6) Horizontal scaling</a></h3>

      <h4>6.1) Introduction</h4>

      <P>In many cases authors on the web design their pages for users
	with at least 640x480 monitors and standard font sizes without
	making allowances differing viewing platforms or even users
	preferences. Although a primary purpose of HTML is to allow the
	browser to format pages appropriately for the display being used
	there are cases where a page would not normally be reformatted.
	This can result in having to scroll a page horizontally to be
	able to see all of it as an NTSC TV has roughly 600 visible
	pixels and uses a larger font size than is normal.

      <P>As an alternative NCBrowser supports an auto-fit feature
	which attempts to scale parts of a page to make it visible
	without horizontal scrolling being necessary.

      <h4>6.2) Problem areas</h4>

      <P>Page elements that cause the extent of the page to become
	greater that the screen width include:

      <OL>
	<LI>Large images
	<LI>Fixed pixel size table columns
	<LI>Lines of text with no spaces
	<LI>Preformatted text
	<LI>Use of the NOBR tag to inhibit line breaks
	<LI>Form text items
      </OL>

      <h4>6.3) Solutions</h4>

      <P>As the font size cannot be reduced very far without making text
	unreadable then the page needs to be reformatted, loosening some
	of the constraints usually enforced by the above areas as
	follows:

      <OL>
	<LI>A scaling factor is calculated by comparing the minimum width
	  that the page would normally require for display to the
	  actual screen (or frame) area available and applied as follows.
	  <UL>
	    <LI>Images are scaled by this factor, maintaining their
	      aspect ratio. 
	    <LI>Table columns with explicit column widths are scaled
	      by this factor.
	    <LI>Form text items are scaled horizontally by this
	      factor. 
	  </UL>

	<LI>The next font size down is used for all text.
      </OL>

      <h4>6.4) User interface</h4>

      <P>The auto fit function is a configurable option which can be
	set or unset by the user from the Custom toolbar and is stored in 
	NVRAM.

      <P>When it is enabled then page rendering happens as follows.
      <OL>
	<LI>As a page is downloaded and formatted the width needed is
	monitored. 

	<LI>If the horizontal extent of the page is less than or equal

      <h4>6.5) Frames</h4>

      <h3><A NAME="Transitions">8) Screen transitions</a></h3>

      <h4>8.1) Introduction</h4>

      <P>Screen transitions are accomplished by the following
	mechanism. When a fetching page has reached the point where it
	is ready to start displaying then the page being displayed is faded
	down to the background colour of the page that is about to be
	displayed (which is known by this point). When the entire
	page has been faded down to the one colour the new page is
	drawn.

      <h4>8.2) Methods</h4>

      <P>The screen fading is performed by directly accessing the
	screen memory to adjust the screen pixel colours. Other
	approaches were considered eg using the CLUTs in the video hardware,
	however that would fade down the toolbar as well, and redrawing
	the page data repeatedly, which would be very slow and
	incomplete as it is not possible to change the colours of images
	in 16bit modes.

      <P>The fade period is approximately one second.

	<P> Whilst the fading is occurring the user cannot perform any
	action on the page (if frames are present then no frame can
	be accessed) however data is still being fetched in the
	background so the fetching time is not affected.

      <h4>8.3) Tiles</h4>

      <P>If there is a tiled background on the page being faded out
	then it is faded down along with the foreground text and
	images. If there is a tiled background on the new page then it
	is only drawn when the tile graphic is fetched. The fade
	colour is the background specified in the HTML. This is
	usually similar to the tile.

      <h4>8.4) Frames</h4>

      <P>If the whole page is being updated then the whole page
	(except for the toolbar) is faded down. If only a single frame
	is being changed then just that frame is faded
	down.

      <P>If the new document being faded in is a FRAMESET then there
	is no background colour defined and so the default
	background colour (black) is used.

      <P>

      <h3><A NAME="mailto">9) Mail to (SMTP)</A></h3>

      <P>Mail to links are commonly found in HTML pages as a way of
	communicating with the author of the page. When clicked upon
	the browser should display a window for the user to enter a
	mail message, with the receiver's address filled in (derived
	from the mailto URL) and buttons to send or cancel the mail
	message. 

      <P>Mailto links are also used in FORMs as an alternative to
	using the HTTP POST command for sending the form data. 

      <h4>9.1) Link to server system</h4>

      <P>If a service provider provides an email service then with the
	addition of some setup <code>mailto</code> can be handled entirely by the provider.

      <P>The browser can be configured with a mailto proxy. When a
      mailto link is selected the request is rerouted to this proxy
      (which should be a complete URL unlike the normal HTTP proxy
      configuration). The URL will be a cgi-bin script on the server.
      The mailto details are appended to the proxy URL as query
      information. The script can then extract this information and
      fill in the form appropriately.

      <P>Note that if the proxy string configured does not end with
      one of the three characters <code>& = ?</CODE> then the browser
      will append a <code>?</code> before the mailto details.

	<P>Also the email address to mail to is prefixed by
	<code>to=</code> so as to make it a standard name value pair
	in the query string.

      <h4>9.2) Example</h4>

      <P>The browser is configured with an mailto proxy of
	<CODE>http://www.fred.com/cgi-bin/send-email</CODE>. 

      <P>If the user clicks on a link to the URL
	<CODE>mailto:smiddleton@acorn.co.uk</CODE> then the browser
	constructs and fetch the URL
	<CODE>http://www.fred.com/cgi-bin/send-email?to=smiddleton@acorn.co.uk</CODE>.

      <P><CODE>send-email</CODE> must be a script on the server that
	can take the query information appended and take the user to
	the appropriate page in the server based email system as if
	they had just decided to reply to a message from
	<code>smiddleton@acorn.co.uk</CODE>.

      <h4>9.4) Form example</h4>

      <P>As long as the mailto handling URL can handle form data being
	posted to it as well then mailto: URLs in forms can also be
	handled in this way.

      <P>If a form has an ACTION specified as
	<CODE>mailto:smiddleton@acorn.co.uk</CODE> and the mailto proxy is
	configured as in the above example, then when the SUBMIT button
	on the form is pressed the browser will attempt to POST the form
	contents to the URL
	<CODE>http://www.fred.com/cgi-bin/send-email?to=smiddleton@acorn.co.uk</CODE>. In
	this case the script should notice that a POST method was used
	and send the POSTed data (unescaped appropriately) to the email
	address specified. No dialogue with the user need be displayed
	although an HTML page saying message sent successfully or
	similar would be helpful - this, however, is up to the service
	provider.

      <h4>9.5) User detection</h4>

      <P>The current user is sent to the server in all transactions as
	a cookie enabling server scripts to distinguish between
	different users.

      <h4>9.6) Mailto arguments</h4>

      <P>Any extra arguments passed to the mailto: URL will be
	appended when this it passed to the mailto proxy. It is
	important that the proxy be able to handle this as this is
	used by the <A href="#sendurl">Send URL</a> function of the
	browser detailed in section 29. 

      <P>In the example above the url fetched if the user clicked on
	send url would be

	<CODE>http://www.fred.com/cgi-bin/send-email?url=<i>url</i></CODE>.

      <h3><A NAME="serverpush">12) Server push</A></h3>

      <P>Server push is accomplished by an HTTP server keeping an
	open connection to the browser and sending it multiple files
	embedded in one HTTP stream.

      <P>This has two uses.
      <OL TYPE=a>
	<LI>Automatically reloading an HTML page
	<LI>Image animation
      </OL>

      <P>If a link is followed to a server-push object then whenever
	the server sends a new object the whole page (which may be
	HTML, text or an image) refreshes - in the same way that
	client-pull refreshing is performed.

      <P>If an inline image is specified as a server-push object then
	when a new image is received in the stream it  replaces the
	current one. Thus giving simple animation.

      <P>Note any object could be a server-push object. Thus it would
	be possible to give a server-push object to, say, BGSOUND and
	change the sound being played from time to time. The browser
	does not support server-push on embedded objects in this

      <h3><A NAME="fontcolour">13) Font colour</a></h3>

      <P>Font colour is the only important part of the HTML 3.2
	specification not supported in Model 1. This implementation
	has a limit of 16 different font colours on a page. If this proves
	not to be enough then a different implementation strategy will
	be used.

      <P>It is possible to change the font colour for every character
	on a page. However in practice only a few colours are used on
	a single page.

      <P>The value 16 is determined by the space currently available
	in the data structures. To remove the limits on
	this value requires either increasing the memory overheads
	or a different strategy requiring more work.

      <P>This limit does not include the colours set for the whole
      page (the plain text, link, visited link and activated link
      colours), the actual limit is 15 individual colours plus one
      colour meaning 'use as dictated by page defaults'

    <P>Note hyperlinks are not affected by the FONT COLOR tag unless
    it is set within the anchor tags. ie.
      &lt;FONT COLOR=red&gt;
      &lt;A HREF=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;
      link to top
      &lt;/A&gt;
      &lt;/FONT&gt;

      would be displayed in the default link colour. Wheres

      &lt;A HREF=&quot;#top&quot;&gt; &lt;FONT COLOR=red&gt; link to
      top &lt;/FONT&gt; would be displayed in red. This is the
      apparent behaviour of Netscape 4 on the PC.

    <P>When the limit is exceeded then the closest colour
	from those already allocated is used.

	<LI>When matching entity names the initial search is

	<LI>If the entity found does in fact have separate upper and
	  lower case versions then the case of the first character
	  of the entity as written is used to determine the case
	  of the result.
	<LI>Numeric entities are recognised even if they are
	  missing the # (eg &amp;160; is recognised as a hard
	  space).
	<LI>Unmatchable entity names are displayed as plain text (eg <CODE>&amp;fred;</CODE>)
      </UL>

      <h5>21.4.3) Tag and attribute names</h5>

      <P>The name parser is changed to work on a closest rather than

      <P><H3><A NAME="toolbar">23) Button Bar</a></H3>

      <P> A button bar is displayed along the bottom of the screen.
      This bar can be toggled on/off. The button bar takes the form of
      a window with no borders which covers a small area at the bottom
      of the display. It is ensured that all components on this button
      bar fall within the safe areas for PAL and NTSC televisions. The
      button graphics for NTSC are pre anti-twittered. 

      <P>There are a number of different tool bars although they are
	all displayed in the same location. A list is kept of all
	toolbars that have been opened so that as they are closed the
	previous is displayed.

      <P>Toolbars are triggered by buttons on other toolbars or key
	shortcuts.

      <P>The toolbars provided are as follows. These names are how
	they are referenced from the HTML commands.
      <UL>
	<LI>Main
	<LI>Favs
	<LI>Extras
	<LI>History
	<LI>Print
	<LI>Details
	<LI>VCR
      </UL>

      <P>Details of how they look and link together are provided in
	the CIS.

      <P>Highlighting of the buttons is performed by the browser not
	by the IconHigh module. This allows alternate graphics to be
	used and the correct buttons to be highlighted when toolbars
	are opened and closed.

      <h4>25.1) Open URL screen</h4>

      <P>The open URL screen appears as a popup HTML screen attached
      to the toolbar as detailed in the CIS.

      <P>The favorites page is displayed and used as shown in the CIS.

      <h4>25.2) History screen</h4>

      <P>The history screen can be displayed in two forms. As a list
	of URLs in the order visited or as an alphabetical list of all
	sites visited. Because sites visited can not be described in a
	linear fashion due to the backtracking that normally goes on
	then this gives the simplest way for the user to see both the
	current branch and all the sites visited.

      <h5>25.2.1) Common features</h5>

      <P>These features are common to both formats.

      <UL>
	<LI>The title of the page is listed unless there is no title
	  in which case the URL is listed instead.

	<LI>Titles wrap around if they are too long.

	<LI>If any link is clicked on then the link is followed.

      </UL>

      <h5>25.2.2) Visited order list</h5>

      <P>The default format is to display the list of the sites in the
	current branch. It has these features:

      <UL>
	<LI>The most recently visited URL is at the top.  

	<LI>The page is scrolled so that the current URL is in the
	  centre of the screen.
      </UL>

      <P>

      <h5>25.2.3) Alphabetical list</h5>

      <P>The alternate format is to order the sites alphabetically by
	title.

      <UL>
	<LI>'A' is listed at the top of the screen.

	<LI>Case is not significant.

      <H3><A NAME="htmltoolbar">29) HTML toolbar</a></H3>

      <P>A URL scheme was introduced in NC OS 1 to allow some control
	of internal browser functions. This scheme is extended for
	this release to allow control of most the tool bar
	actions so that arbitrary toolbars can be constructed at run
	time using HTML.

      <P>The function available are as follows. They are used by
	prefixing with <code>ncfrescointernal:</code> or <code>ncint:</code>

      <P>By default each command references the top level
	frame. However this can be changed by adding a query parameter
	to the URL. eg

      <P><CODE>ncfrescointernal:favadd?source=<i>framename</i></CODE>

      <P>This will add the URL of the page displayed in the frame
	labelled <i>framename</i> to the favorites list. The special
	frame names <CODE>_self</CODE>, <CODE>_top</CODE> and
	<CODE>_parent</CODE> can be used as normal. If the frame name
	is unknown then the command is ignored.

      <P>Commands that need to remove transient pages after use can
      also include an extra query parameter <CODE>remove</CODE> which
      takes a value of the frame name to be removed.

      <P>Commands that need to control the toolbar can
      also include an extra query parameter <CODE>toolbar</CODE> which
      takes a value of 'on' or 'off'.

	<h2> <a name="test"> 11.0 Development test strategy </a> </h2>

	<P>In general, where new HTML features are being added then test
	  pages to test these features, used correctly and incorrectly,
	  are constructed. These test pages are kept and usd to
	perform regression tests at regular intervals.

	<h3>Rendering</h3> 

	<P>A range of different JPEGs (standard,
	  progressive, non-JFIF) will be created to check that the correct
	  routines are used in each case

	<P>A server script will be written to feed an interlaced GIF to
	  the browser at different speeds to check the level of
	  anti-twitter at different simulated transfer rates. Different
	  sizes of GIFs on different backgrounds will be used.

	<P>Pages will be added to the test suite featuring different
	  combinations of image size specifications in different
	  contexts (plain, in a table, in a nested table, floating).

	<h3>Rendering performance</h3>

	<P>Particularly slow pages will be compared in loading speed
	  betwen old and new code to check for improvements.

	<P>A server script will be written to check that HTTP Keep-Alive
	  performs as expected. This will allow checking of performance
	  improvements and handling of badly behaved servers by
	  emulating problems.

	<h3>2d Navigation</h3>
	<P>Test pages will be created with with worst case arrangements
	  of links to ensure that the movement is always sensible.

	<h3>Horizontal scaling and point size select</h3>

	<P>Test pages will be created with with various combinations of
	  the problem causing elements to ensure that the pages are
	  still readable after scaling has been performed. The
	  interaction of changing point size and scaling the pages will
	  be tested.

	<h3>Screen transitions</h3>

	<P>Server scripts will be written to cause page transitions
	  between pages with various differently coloured backgrounds and
	tiling schemes. Also various
	  different arrangements of frames will be created. The extremes
	  will be tested (ie very small frames).

	<h3>Server push</h3>
	<P>Server scripts will be written to exercise the server-push
	  handling code. This will feed down varying streams including:
	<UL>
	  <LI>Mixture of different text types (plain text and HTML).
	  <LI>Mixture of different image types (GIF,JPEG,PNG).
	  <LI>Different sized images.
	  <LI>Mixture of images and text
	  <LI>Mixture of images and objects that can't be handled internally.
	</UL>

	<h3>Background sound</h3>
	<P>Test embedding of all different sound types. Check
	  behaviour when there is more than one bgsound specified, on
	  the same page and on different frames. Check moving between
	  pages, especially when there is bgsound on both pages, and
	  behaviour on initial download and from cache. Check behaviour
	  when other sounds are played whilst bgsound active. Also what
	  happens when Replay plays a movie or sound and when Java or
	  Shockwave plays sounds.

	<h3>SSL</h3>
	<P>Check behaviour when accessing sites with invalid or out of
	  date certificates or certificated by an unrecognised
	authority. And check each supported cipher individually
	against common servers (Netscape, Microsoft, Apache).

	<h3>Automated testing</h3>

	<p>Complete coverage from an automated test suite for an HTML
	  browser is a difficult task and <i>not</i> what this test suite
	  attempts to do. Rather, regular (eg overnight) automated testing
	  of a set of readily measurable criteria run on both new and
	  previous HTML samples is intended to supplement manual testing
	  to quickly pinpoint obvious failures. The core abilities
	  required and expected benefits from automated testing are as
	  follows:

	<p>
	  
	<dl>

	  <dt>Automated testing control

	  <dd>A simple control mechanism replaces the action of the user
	    clicking on links, etc. The ability to open and close multiple
	    windows, and to feed URLs to windows to be displayed, are the
	    primary actions required. Bugs resulting in assertion failures
	    or address exceptions (etc) are caught by the browser ceasing
	    to respond to automated control messages.

	  <dt>Screen object rectangle checking

	  <dd>At any given level of screen object nesting, there should
	    be no pixel overlap. Any nested objects must be entirely
	    contained. A large number of failures can be detected when
	    these two contraints are not matched.

	  <dt>Memory checking

	  <dd>Two aspects of memory handling are worth checking:
	    ensuring that memory gets freed when the parent window is
	    closed and that low memory situations do not provoke
	    exceptions.

	  <dt>Regular feeding of new HTML

	  <dd>Each day, the list of new URLs published by Yahoo! is
	    collected and each referenced page used as part of the test
	    suite. Any page with any failure is added to the permanent
	    archive; all other pages are checked only once. This is
	    expected to help track new variants of broken HTML as soon as
	    they appear, rather than waiting for notification via bug
	    reports.

	  <dt>Archive of previous failure examples

	  <dd>Creating an archive of all previously failing pages and
	    subjecting the browser to these pages each night will
	    minimise the time window for which knock-on bugs will remain
	    undetected.
