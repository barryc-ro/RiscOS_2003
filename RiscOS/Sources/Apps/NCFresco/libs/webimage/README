|   Information about the webimage library

The webimage library is a set of C functions for translating (in memory) from
various foreign image formats to RISC OS sprites. Dithering is optionally 
performed on JPEGs and PNGs, but no other colour translation or rescaling is
performed by these routines.

Formats currently supported are; XBM, GIF (GIF87, GIF89a interlaced and/or
transparency masked, GIF89 animations with NetScape 2.0 looping extension),
JPEG (baseline and progressive modes), PiNG (greyscale, paletted colour, true
RGB colour, with interlacing, alpha channels and  transparency masks), RISC OS
Sprite.

This library has no external dependencies except the standard SharedCLibrary, and
(a compile time option) uses malloc() or heap_alloc() for memory allocation.

All the image translation modules are demand loaded as DLLs - no special code
should be required to use this. A non-DLL version of this library is 
available if required.

Tools are available to convert & manipulate Sprites/GIF/PiNG/JPEG/TIFF -
email me for more details.

Release notes 17/Apr/96:
  - Work to support TIFFs (not included in this release)
  - Changes to library - renamed imgpath() to imginit(), and added imgreaper()
    fn to kill of unused DLLs (library no longer kills DLL immediately after
    finishing with it)
  - Much better JPEG code, including outputting the palette in the first write
    function along with the sprite header, and new progressive rendering code
  - Much better PNG code, with working interlace decoding and real progressive
    rendering
  - New GIF 8bpp dithering code active unless _deepsprite on

Known problems:
  - PNG library still has major problems dithering from 24bpp to 8bpp and
    garbage will result. 24bpp -> 16bpp (deep colour) works fine.
