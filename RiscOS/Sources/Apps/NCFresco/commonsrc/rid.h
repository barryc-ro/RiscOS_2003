/* This file defines the Riscos Internal Data structues to store the parsed data */

/**********************************************************************************

The data structure has to be able to store both the text itself and
all the relevant markup information.  It needs to store the data in a
form that makes it easy to map a position on the page to a section of
text for both ploting and use of links.  We need to be able to go from
an HREF 'name' attribute value to the start of the A block that has
that name value and we need to be able to go from the start of that
block to the position on the screen.  We also need to be able to
reformat the text with ease if the user wants to change the width.


The document is divided into five conceptual sections: header, text,
positioning, style and A-ref.

The header section contains document wide information.  This includes
the title, a base reference if there is one and pointers to locate the
other three parts.

The next part is the 'text' stream.  This is a doublely linked list of
items that will be displayed on the screen.  The items consist of a
header specifying the forward and reverse pointers and a tag
indicating what sort of object the item is, along with pointers to the
'positioning' list, to a style entry and to an A-ref entry.  Each
object also has values for its hight above and deapth below the text
base-line and its width on the display where relevent.  The object
might be a single word (in unformated text), a line (in pre-formated
text), a paragraph break, a horizontal rule or an image.  The exact
data context and size of the item depends on the tag value but the
header infomation at the from of the object is constant (and thus
determines the minimum size).

The 'positioning' list is a list of structures containing the maximum
rise and decent of the items on a line and the vertical position of
the top of the line within the displayed document.  It also contains a
pointer to the first object in the 'text' list that is to be displayed
on the given line.  To paint a strip of the screen the position is
located within the positioning list and then the objects are rendered
until the next object in the 'text' list is the first object of the
next line.

A style entry contains information used for the rendering of an object
from the 'text' list.  Since this infomation is usually the same from
one item to the next it makes sense to keep a pointer to the common
information rather than having copies for each object.  The style
entries are stored in a list so that they can be freed easily and so
that they can be changed should the user ask to change a font or tyep
size.

An A-ref entry is maintained for each 'A' block in the document.  It
holds all the attributes associated with the block and it contains a
pointer to the first item in the 'text' list in the within the block
so that when the section is found by name it can be located on the
page.  Pointing to the text item rather than directly to the
'positioning' list costs a little in terms of access but makes
reformating easier.  The A-ref items are stored in a list so that they
can be searched for a given name attribute.

/*****************************************************************************

    Scanning the list of items forming a document is complicated by the
    nesting introduced for tables.  Rather than direct examination, all
    traversal must now go through rid_scan() or antweb_apply().  Some
    optimising macros wrap rid_scan() for the typical cases.

    rid_scan() will, by default, return the next item, neither entering
    and not leaving tables.  The action pack permits different behaviour.
    SCAN_BACK causes the scan to go backwards (ie using prev pointers rather
    than next pointers).  SCAN_UP causes the scan to continue in any
    enclosing table once the end of the current stream has been met.
    SCAN_DOWN causes tables to be entered.  A table item is never returned if
    the SCAN_DOWN flag is included.  If SCAN_FILTER is included, then a
    rid_tag should also be included.  Only items with a matching type are
    then returned.  SCAN_EXCLUDE causes negation on the SCAN_FILTER criteria.
    Filtering does not override the SCAN_DOWN exclusion of tables.  NULL is
    returned when another suitable item cannot be found (eg end of chain).

    SCAN_RECURSE replaces SCAN_DOWN and SCAN_UP - you might be able to go up
    and down independently, but not at present.

    antweb_apply() performs the same traversal as rid_scan(), except it
    then takes the supplied function and invokes it on each item that
    rid_scan() would have successively yielded.  Scanning is terminated if
    the user function returns non-NULL.  antweb_apply() returns NULL to
    indicate it reached the end of the list, or a non-NULL value returned by
    the callers function.  Note that the use of antweb_apply() is drastically
    restricted because we cannot have nested function definitions with
    context shared with their parent.  Sigh.

    Four macros perform the frequent operations.  rid_scanf() scans
    forward without recursion, rid_scanb() scans backwards without
    recursion, rid_scanfr() scans forward with recursion and
    rid_scanbr() scans backwards with recursion.  The forward scanning
    macros perform some optimisation and attempt to avoid the overhead of a
    function call.
