17th MArch 1997: Borris

Merged patches from Si.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

17th March 1997: Borris

Merged comment handling patches from Dave.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

13th March 1997: Borris

Merged diffs from Si.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

12th March 1997: Borris

Merged diffs from Si.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

10th March 1997: Simon.

Delivery of SI_970310 diffs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

11th March 1997: Borris

Fixed debugging bug in backend.c (fl/fr mismatch). Made
webfont_font_width always present as oinput.c has an unconditional use
of it now.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

10th March 1997. Dave

Merged in with main branch on gi.ant from DL_970213

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

6th March 1997.  Dave

The behaviour of bad markup has been reviewed and strategy (mostly)
decided.  FLAG_DONT_STACK has been abolished and replaced with
FLAG_DONT_FORCE_CLOSE which will keep an element live on the stack
instead of forcing it closed.  So elements such as FORM and TABLE will
only be closed by the matching markup.  FLAG_FIX_CLOSE_ORDER has been
renamed to FLAG_OUT_OF_ORDER_CLOSE (which was unused, but my first
choice). Such elements will not close any other elements if they are
closed too soon.  Substantial streamlining of perform_element_close as
a result.

Prerequisite INVENT_ONLY_WITHIN has been introduced to suppress
inventing dummy elements to enclose others. In such a case the element
is replaced by the element specified in the REPLACE_WITH
prerequisite. Such an element must be distinct and have the
REPLACES_BAD flag referencing the original element. E.g., LI -> BADLI.
For simplicity in the close case, the REPLACES_BAD must be the first
requisite.

See atrrconf.notes for details of flags and which have changed.  The
new 'bad' handlers can be found in fresparse/special.c.

All uses of PACK have now been replaced by SET_EFFECTS allowing, e.g.,
size and colour to be closed independently. It is not perfect as it
merely restores the effect to before the element, and any inner styles
will override it.  Where webfont size is set, a finer mask is now used
(STYLE_WF_SIZE defined in webfonts.h) to allow fonts to be undone
independently of other webfont effects.

The comment state machine has been changed to correctly handle SGML
comments - the description claimed this to be the case but it wasn't
so I may have reversed some attempt to handle bad comments better by
mistake.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ist March 1997.  Dave

To handle bad comments, the state machine has been extended to drop an
anchor at the first ">" while waiting for a closing - or --. If the
end of stream is reached and we are still in such a state, we
backtrack and feed the characters from the anchor onwards as if in the
context of just before the comment.  We always start one character
after the anchor so it is guaranteed to terminate, but a pathological
source file will take a *long* time.  This required changes to
SGMLCTX, sgml_stream_finished as well as the state machine itself.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

20th February 1997.  Dave

For GROUP_NONE items, out of order closes now pull the matching close
to the top of the stack rather than closing all until the matching
close.  Flag FIX_CLOSE_ORDER introduced to give this behaviour
(without, the old phantom behaviour is still obtained). This is
currently set for all the style tags: B, I, ..., EM, ..., FONT.
Routines find_element_in_stack and pull_stack_item_to_top introduced
to support.c

Some uses of UNPACK/PACK have been replaced with SET_EFFECTS_FLAG and
SET_EFFECTS_WF_FLAG (with corresponding routines set_effects_flag_fn
and set_effects_wf_flag_fn in support.c).  STACK_ITEM has a new field
effects_applied which is to be used by SET_EFFECTS_FLAG to allow out
of order undoing of the effects of an element. effects_applied is
zeroed in clear_stack_item and on *every* push_item.

Rule: take the effects_active from an arbitrary point on the stack and
apply all subsequent effects_applied and you should get to the
effects_active at TOS. In the long term this principle should be
applied to *all* the effects.

Introduced OUT to replace wanton use of stderr with checkers. Only a
few substitutions so far. dump.c now switches on the CHECKER flag and
won't print pointers in dumps. (I have used #ifndef as CHECKER => a
subset.)  check_all et al., now dump the html tags and report to a log
file for later comparison. This will spot some changed behaviour
without being sensitive to addresses.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

24th February 1997: Borris

Fixed #else #else problem - Si's diffs will probably also fix this!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

24th February 1997: Borris

Merged diffs from Si to BORRIS_970218 version. Expanded seperately
packaged binary of !NCFResco/Resources/UK directory, added couple of
Sprites3 files.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

19th February 1997: Simon

Added ID to various elements. and some new attributes to the form
elements.  Set be_item_info_ISMAP bit over an INPUT TYPE=IMAGE unless
the new NOCURSOR bit is set. if htmlriscos_colour() hasn't got a valid
value_type it sets the colour to -1.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

24th February 1997: Borris

Ran sortout.py --eol on webftp, webgopher and commonsrc to remove all
the ^M carriage returns.  The result of Acorn using CVS is all the
dollar ID strings are modified, including in directories Si has not
altered but which have ^M convention. Sending the diffs through the
email loses the ^M information, and patch has a hard time as a result.
As of now, the policy is to remove ^M as soon as possible.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

20th February 1997: Peter

Fixed "play forever" animations. Fixed images going wrong on mode change.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

20th February 1997: Borris

Bumped version to 1.38. Fixed some minor things that gcc warned about when
asked to compile with virtually every warning it knows about.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

19th February 1997: Peter

Fix "refresh=ondispose" problem. Fix <style> stopping text display.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

19th February 1997: Borris

Ensure the following were correct and up to date by getting a rerelease
from Nick Smith:

M webimage/test,ff8
M webimage/webimage

Bumped version to 1.37 after doing a production build of 1.36 for Dean to
release for internal testing to see what we've improved/broken during the
recent merge.

<font colour> accepted same as <font color>. Couple of minor
uninitialised variables now initialised.

!Fresco/RelNotes,faf created.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

18th February 1997: Borris

Finally resolved the issue of where objparse.c lives. I had placed it
in commonsrc, and Si had placed it in fresparse. This was not a
problem until the two source trees where bought directly
together. From now on, objparse.c lives in the fresparse directory
(and the commonsrc version has disappeard to the attic).

Created cvs-checks.py - a python program to scan the source tree and
flag potential problems. At present, it looks for the blah and
blah,ffd type clashes, as these all need resolving. cvs-checks is a
wrapper that means things don't barf when python is not availabe (eg
ANT's riscix box). Makefile altered so that one CANNOT complete a
compilation if the sanity checks fail. PLEASE fix the sanity checks or
the checker instead of just trying to bypass this.

Symbolic links: see the README file. Always do a ./makelinks after
receiving an update.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

17th February 1997: Borris

Merged various source trees. Getting to build again.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

14th February 1997. Borris

Added ssleay/roheaders to top level makelinks, so a cross compilation of
http works correctly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

10th March 1997: Borris

Merged diffs from Si into SI_970228 point.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7th March 1997: Simon

Some more work on form elements. New LABEL element implemented from
W3C working draft. Means changes throughout to handling of aref items. 
They now have an extra bit to say whether they are a URL anchor or a
label anchor. 

Extensions to backend_item_info for plugins and labels.

Extension to backend_check_meta() to pull out expires and last modified
from cache (after abortive attempt to add real http headers to meta
list - would be useful but can wait).

OBJECTs now get formatted even if the apporpriate plugin can't be found.
image support for OBJECTs completed including SHAPES and USEMAP. Not very
tested though.

New backend function for locating an ID on a page. New document flag
to cause the NC highlight box to be drawn as a coloured background.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7th March 1997: Peter

Fix RiscOSLib so it builds under Unix. "make riscoslib" does the
business. "make realclean" removes it and its objects. The
library file itself probably shouldn't be in the repository now.
Similarly for memlib.
    Coalescing of rid_text_item_text's when they've all got the
same style anyway (big memory win). <DL COMPACT> and
<BLOCKQUOTE>. <DL> now formats in Fresco the same way it does in
Netscape and NCFresco (changes appearance of some pages).
    Frobbed with FVPR so it never causes blank pages :-( ...
still some work needed to make it DTRT unfortunately.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

28th February 1997: Borris

Fixed Makefile so lack of abs directory doesn't delete all the top
level files. Tag SI_970228 is what Si's latest diffs are against.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

27th February 1997: Borris

Adjusted mklinks for RISC_OSLib to make it work. Improvements to FVPR
algorithm - actually seems to do something useful now! Changed some
debugging routines from BLAH to BLAHN to improve the performance of
the code when debugging is present. There are many pieces of debugging
present that could be removed RSN!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

26th February 1997: Borris

First stab at final value progressive rendering implementation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

25th February 1997: Borris

Moved lookup_key_action from util.c to portutil.c (debatable where it
belongs, as it invokes no OS specific code). Other changes to make
builders build again.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

28th February 1997: Borris

Merged Si's changes in to SI_970227.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

27th February 1997: Simon

Added more new attributes to form elements. Moved push_input from builders.c
into forms.c. Lots of work in oimage.c and oinput.c to support new
attributes. Moved to sharing image code so now INPUTs can have width and
height and alt text.
Some new plugin features supported. Added plugin info to backend_item_info().
Fixed said function to return image flag and handle when an image object is
interrogated (didn't appear to happen before!).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

27th February 1997: Borris

Merged full tree from Si into SI_970224. Sorted out MemCheck.h
clash. Renamed stdalone/makefile,fe1 for safety reasons. Removed a few
dollar IDs from header files.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

24th February 1997: Simon

Tried to move NCFresco to memlib. Fiddled with various MEMLIB bits around
the place to get a clean build. Fixed some leftovers from Borris's last
changes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

24th February 1997: Borris

Fixed #else #else problem - Si's diffs will probably also fix this!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

24th February 1997: Borris

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

17th February 1997: Borris

Merged various source trees. Getting to build again.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

14th February 1997. Borris

Added ssleay/roheaders to top level makelinks, so a cross compilation of
http works correctly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

13th February 1997. Borris

Merged Dave's initial changes (dave-970213-a) in to the tree.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

13th February 1997. Peter

HTTP module: keep-alive, image prefix fetching. Common sources:
font colour, anti-alias to table backgrounds. Fresco: stop button
does complete stop, bogus Referer lines eliminated.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7th February 1997. Borris

Fudge for minc/maxc in tablesize.c for when get minimum size larger than
maximum size.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7th February 1997. Peter

Fix year wrapping bug in webftp. Couple of minor alt.typography.pedant
fixes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

29th January 1997. Borris

Minor tweak in rid.h to make it compile. Few other small tweaks. About
to export version to Dave Lloyd.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

13th January 1997. Borris

Moved repository over to gi.ant.co.uk. Minor tweaks for bu compilation.
Played with CVS repository access permissions a bit.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

17th October 1996. Borris

Started commonsrc/coretypes.h for those basic types (like BOOL and intxy).
Please migrate appropriate definitions there as you find them.

Started basic rectangle overlap consistency checker.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

10th December 1996. Borris

Hack in rid_text_item_connect for NULL streams. Must be properly fixed
someday!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

9th December 1996. Borris

Updated makelinks to do plingcbresco - you might need to rerun this.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

19th November 1996. Borris

Upped version to 1.34 so properly merged version from Si is distinguishable.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

31st October 1996. Borris

Made \t, \r and \n as acceptable as space for comma seperated lists.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

9th December 1996. Peter

Added CBFresco directory and sources, copied from NCFresco but
then diverged. Some changes in commonsrc for CBFresco as well
(#ifdef CBPROJECT).

Added !Fresco support for forms with action=mailto:xxx and
method=post (by swiping the code from NCFresco).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

13th November 1996. Borris

Merged SI_961112

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

8th October 1996. Simon

Use draw module for underlining/strikethrough for printing to get round
offset problems with bitmap printers. Except I didn't cos it still doesn't
work.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7th October 1996. Simon

Added 4 bytes to sprite area allocated in images.c. This is to fix an
apparent spriteextend bug causing it to read one word bwyond the end of
a sprite area.

Moved changing display_scale/margins in print start job to before the
document format and added call to antweb_document_sizeitems().

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

6th October 1996. Simon

Added bit in access_http_fetch_alarm to check and see if the file coming in
was a server-push. If it is in then the access is aborted. This is
conditionally compiled for NC only at the moment.
Send Host: header. Without this some sites go wrong these days.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4th October 1996. Simon

URL escapes now match Netscape. A-F in upper case. unescaped *-.@_

Fixed serious memory leak in http module - the headers to be sent were
copied into the RMA but then never freed. Also noted leak in SSL specific
code where strings used to construct SSL headers are strdup'd twice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

30th October 1996. Simon

Post freeze changes!

image_thread_end() now loops until the thread dies. This stops a nasty leak
of memory when you abort an image fetch.

cookie default path is / rather than the document URL.

new flag in frontend_open_url to say that document was loaded as part of a
frameset.

Fixed problem with new hacky error scheme on access failures not always
getting an error message.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7th November 1996. Dean

Updated version number in !Help file to 1.32.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

28th October 1996. Borris

Merged SI_961028

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

28th October 1996. Simon

Changed cache flushing to work (wipe contents of each directory not the
top directory!). And explicitly remove details.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

25th October 1996. Simon

Took table_deliver installation out of finishtd/th/tr. Any unexpected chars
gets added into previous cell rather than creating new cells. This fixes a
lot of table formatting problems.

In otext_size an empty text item now has no descender. This fixes the problem
of <IMG><BR><IMG> getting a black line between the two images at the expense
of the <BR><BR> difference being slightly smaller.

In http_fetch_alarm() if HTTP_SetFileType file types something as data then
call suffix_to_file_type. Fixes a problem with sites that send
application/octet-stream rather than the correct type.

When a password was entered the code to save cookies and passwords
autmoatically was bypassed because of the redirection. Fixed this.

Made auth_lookup_string malloc the string it returns as otherwise you can't
proxy and normal authenticate at once.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

25th October 1996. borris

Merged SI_961024

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

24th October 1996. Simon

Silly bug with checking file types on ftp/gopher meant couldn't load anything
except plugins. Wouldn't have affected Fresco though.

Changed cache images to use palettes when <= 8bpp. This seems to stop a crash
problem.

Made AREA and MAP nostack items.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

21st October 1996. Borris

MAde malloc into mm_malloc in strdup_gstrans.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

24th October 1996. Borris

Merged SI_961023

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

23rd October 1996. Simon

Tried to catch more out of memory problems. Added antweb_abort_doc_all() to
backend.c which is called from mm_can_we_recover(). Added call to recover
to memzone_alloc().
Rewrote HTParseTime completely to cope with yet another dumb format from
Oracle. Should cope with just about anything now.

Changed most occurences of time_t as for some reason it is now coming out
as 'long' rather than 'unsigned int' (dumb inet headers) and cookies
are all failing.

Made my fix to finisha only occur when not at the top level stream. It has
a problem in that the zero-size item can still cause a line to split after
it.

Changed the way that overlaps work to (maybe) be the same way as Netscape.
The new cell stomps on the old cell, rather than the other way around.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

22nd October 1996. Simon

Fixed leak in gstrans_not_null(). Added loads of MemCheck calls to aid
memory leak tracking. Really fixed the huge box that appears if you had
<IMG WIDTH=xx ALT=XX> (got pixels and font units mixed up).
Made Proxy authorization work.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

21st October 1996. Simon

Fixed backend_item_pos_info() again - if you have a client-side imagemap then
you never want to return the ISMAP link.

Fixed malloc not mm_malloc bug in strdup_gstrans().

Added MemCheck support. Found NULL deref in config_check_vars()
and rid_scan(). Possible string overwrite in url_canonicalise_path
(not tracked down yet).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

18th October 1996. Simon

Fiddled with STBWEB redial stuff in access.c. Changed the user file load code
to check for file existence rather than system variable not null.

If finisha finds that nothing has been given the aref and text_last is NULL then
it pushes an empty text item. This fixes the case of <TD><A NAME="fred"></A>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

18th October 1996. Peter

Some cosmetic stuff for Fresco (NCFresco not affected): icons aligned
to 4 OS units vertically in templates file (so they indent properly in
rectangle modes); DragASprite calls added to savedoc.c (stops us looking
quite so RiscOS 2-ish).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

18th October 1996. Borris

Merged SI_961017

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

17th October 1996. Simon.

Slightly cleaned up the way file type checking works for http. Added it to
gopher and ftp methods. Added missing error checking on HTTP SWIs (in case
the module is killed mid-transit).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

16th October 1996. Simon.

my.yahoo.com showed up two tables problems which I have hacked fixes to
(look for SJM).
  scanback() doesn't seem to get out of tables. So if the ->prev ptr is null
  it now falls back to the old method.
  new_sizer() was getting a divide by zero.

backend_doc_image_change() was still not right with floating images. The
entire stream is now searched. Inefficient, but will work.

More printing fixes. Disable font blending. Disable the new margins. Disable
the scaled up fonts.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

15th October 1996. Borris

New GIF DLL from Nick.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

16th October 1996. Borris

Merged SI_961015

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

15th October 1996. Simon

Fixes to animations. Basically a few more cases than originally expected
may end up showing through to the background and so require plotting
via masks. Also the animation needs to be reset (mask cleared) at the start.

NO_PICS was ignored in oimage.c so pictures couldn't be turned off in
printing.

Added Proxy-authentication code to access.c
Added checks for null pathnames after gstransing in auth, cookie, pluginfile.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

14th October 1996. Borris

Merged SI_961014

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

14th October 1996. Simon

More margin problems. Images weren't being updated correctly when they
reformatted. (frontend_view_block_move didn't take margins into account).
goto_fragment was compensating twice.

Removed once-only restriction from HTML tag. This stops the following going
wrong. Dunno what else it may affect though.
<HTML>
<FRAMESET>
<NOFRAMES>
<HTML><BODY></BODY></HTML>
</NOFRAMES>
</FRAMESET>
</HTML>

Altered LOCATION handling code slightly so that all other headers (eg
cookies) are handled before the new URL is fetched.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

14th October 1996. Borris

Now choose between Nicko's height sharing and the old height sharing
code based upon how many rows there are in the table - Nicko's code
does better but has much higher overheads. Fixed minor bug in old
height sharing code.

In sheer desperation, added some code that stomps all width
specifications for an entire nestet table tree if the minwidth of it
formats larger than the width we're going to format it in.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

13th October 1996. Borris

Fixed some odd ANTI_TWITTER and USE_MARGINS bugs.

Made tables suppress their left/right floating flag setting until the
/TABLE as a cheap hack to get around problems when a table gets
formatter multiply. This needs sorting out properly someday!

Went back to old share_span_evenly height method for tables as
otherwise a 3000 line table effectively kills us (certainly with NC
type memory quantities).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

13th October 1996. Borris

Merged SI_961011.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

11th October 1996. Simon

More on FORM. Changed table_deliver() to pass on FORM open and close without
side-effects. Removed flag_block from FORM in attrconf.

Made some more changes to margins. Small change to Fresco/frontend.c to
support it.

Changed #ifdef DEBUG to #if DEBUG in myassert.h and debug.h and changed
#ifdef NDEBUG to #if !DEBUG. We don't want assertion failures in production
code do we? Then fixed the bugs in the tables.c asserts that didn't show up
before.

Added returning error message for status_FAIL_DNS as well as the FAIL_CONNECT
done yesterday.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

13th October 1996. Borris

Added prev fields for images and tables so rid_scanb can work without
having to rely upon the rid_pos_item pointer, as this pointer is not
always directly suitable when the item is floating, and I can't quite
work out a perfect solution that wanders the list (eg very last item
is floating). Something better might happen if we restructure how
floating items are performed. This doesn't handle <BR>
considerations. Shout if you notice this.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

11th October 1996. Borris

Fixed table backgrounds. Update webgopher makefile to by a unix
one. Update makelinks program to do *zm links as well - you'll need to
run this (./makelinks) before you'll be able to build webgopher.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

10th October 1996. Borris

Temporary fix for webgopher and inet5. Minor bug fix for http module doing
same thing. Needs checks on docn. to do properly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

10th October 1996. Borris

Merged SI_961010.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

10th October 1996. Simon

Made the memset that clears the image background in images.c not do
anything if there are 0 bytes to clear. It may have bearing on some strange
crashing.

Applied cunning hack to enable badly nested FORMs (ie most of them) to still
work. There is a new flag in attrconf FLAG_DONT_STACK which currently is only
set on FORM. In parse_element_open() everything happens as normal except
  push_stack() doesn't happen
  instead of setting the bit in context->tos->elements_open it sets a bit in
  context->dont_stack_elements_open

In parse_element_close() a third case is added to the check for a normal
close - if the element is DONT_STACK and the bit set above is set. In which
case all happens as normal except the pop isn't done.

The last change is that (almost) wherever any code checked for a bit set in
context->tos->elements_open it now calls a function which checks this bit
and the equivalent bit in dont_stack_elements_open. This allows all the
form elements to carry on working exactly as before.

rid_table_place_cols() was writing to one of its arrays without checking
that there was anything there (ie >= 1 cells). This took some while to find.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

9th October 1996. Borris

Merged SI_961009. MEMLIB tweaks.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

9th October 1996. Simon

Changed antweb_doc_complete so that it checks the file size first. If the
file size is 0 it treats it as a failed download attempt.

Put MENU and DIR back to having bullets.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

8th October 1996. Simon

Fixed long-standing problem in cache. File 00 was never being read at
startup.

Got frames to work with pages that don't use NOFRAMES at all. It inserts the
noframes sequence after the last /FRAMESET. Had to change sgml_unwind_deliver
to make this work - I think there was a big there...

Found problem with images in tables sometimes not being updated even though
the data is obviously loaded. the loop in the redraw section of
doc_image_change stopped when the line top went below the bottom of the page.
However in tables the next line top could be back on screen again. So I
removed the check for the end. This is inefficient but will work.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4th October 1996. Simon

Push null item after table toget round scanning problems. Fiddled with new
mem stuff a bit to get a clean build for STBWEB without it.
Added left and top margin attribute parsing to BODY and rid_header.
Fixed a couple of margin related left-overs in otextarea.c and printing.c

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

9th October 1996. Borris

Fixed bug in stream_find_item_location that was uncovered by correctly
initialising the parent pointer for the top level stream. Stopped
infinite spinning due to new_sizer stupidity I made. Si likewise fixed
this I think.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

8th October 1996. Borris

Initalised root stream to have parent field correct! Made
rid_size_stream take a rid_text_item to indicate where it should start
formating from. This fixes the problem where <TABLE WIDTH=N> forced
the table to be stretched wider and rid_size_items got called multiply
but rid_table_share_width only got called once. Made non-production
heap allocators do the correct checking and report an error if they
fail, rather than just driving me mad ten functions later.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5th October 1996. Borris

If a table supplies a width and its cells supply widths that add up to
greater than the tables supplied width, all cell-based width
specifications are removed and formatting happens again. This is not
the same as Netvirus, which will preserve relative column sizes, buts
it's a lot easier.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4th October 1996. Borris

Merged SI_961003. Tidied things up a bit.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

03 October 1996. Simon

Fixed object CODEBASE (was being written out as NAME).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

02 October 1996. Simon

finishselect(). Made it select exactly one option if non-multiple menu.

Finally got offsets right for background in animatied gifs.

Added save area usage to one of the sprite output switches to handle the
fact that it might get switched twice (if building a tile).

Added CENTER/CENTRE to IMG ALIGN (appears to mean the same as MIDDLE, often
used by clueless authors and accepted by Netscape).

Made one function to decode the img align type, called by object, img and
input. Previously input wouldn't understand align left and right.

Fix to parse_colour_tuple. The *16 was happening on separator characters as
well as digits.

Finally tracked down crash when reloading a page with an INPUT TYPE=image on
it - code in doc_image_change assumed that an image was always contained in
a rid_text_item_image. Very bad...

Added some hacky bits to access_*_dns_alarm functions and the complete
functions so that the frontend can get hold of the actual errors that
occurred when trying to connect. Some nasty reusing of parameters but
it seems safe enough.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4th October 1996. Borris

Fixed bug where last few words of a document might not get sized as
they got "presented" when the stream got closed and flushed, which was
occuring after the sizing operation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3rd October 1996. Peter

Plenty of work on memory routines: mm_malloc/mm_free now call a
version which keeps the arena in a dynamic area (if possible);
new header "flexwrap.h" allows flex to be in a DA too. Added new
directory "memlib" containing the new routines (and a Unix
makefile for them). Fix a couple of memory leaks in savedoc.c and
frontend.c

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

30th September 1996. Borris.

Altered calculation of table cell vertical positioning (esp when
VALIGN=MIDDLE etc) to take cellspacing and cellborder values in to
account.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

27th September 1996. Borris

Extended BGCOLOR to be a table cell property inherited like HALIGN
(same order, etc).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

26 September 1996. Borris

Caught a few places where DEBUG and not SGML_REPORTING would do stupid
things and fixed them. Made copying of the RELEASE directory use -p to
preserve time stamp information. MAde distribution building create a
tar file of !Fresco for easier distribution.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

27th September 1996. Borris

Merged SI_960926.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

26 September 1996. Simon

Changed a few files more over to new style error reporting.
Fixed the NULL link being written out when over NOHREF regions.

Leak in starttable - caption was allocated then never used.
Leak in sgml_reporting. Bizarre way in which linked list was created meant
that it didn't get freed whn traversing via next so used prev instead.
Leak in cookie_dispose_all (domain names).

Changed config loading. Fresco code is now back to the way it originally was.
Functions to load by file name are now exported for NCFresco to use.

bcakend_goto_fragment now only gives error if the document has finished
downloading.

Made center nestable which is what ns does.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

26 September 1996. Borris

Merged SI_960925.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

25th September 1996. Simon

HTParseTime now accepts an abreviated date form that netscape accepts and
oracle use. This doesn't affect any of the other forms it accepts.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

24th September 1996. Borris

Production code now uses MEMWATCH of 0. Debugging code still needs to
be updated, as it appears to be lacking the memory recovery code. Why
this is so, I haven't the foggiest. It shouldn't be. It does explain
why fresco has been bad about memory recovery for a while!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

24th September 1996. Borris

Changed some uses of stream to curstream in deliver.c This explains
why table nesting changed behaviour - the decisions where being made
against a different stream! This sorts out Nicko's interesting <LI>
set of examples.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

24th September 1996. Peter

Fixed background tiling in rectangle-pixel modes

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

23rd September 1996. Borris

Tracked down yet another bug whereby table maximum width was coming
out less than the minimum width. This time, it was due to unfortunate
formatting causing minwidth calculations to place a PBREAK item at the
start of a line, but for maxwidth formatting the PBREAK got added to
the previous line, adding it's width of -1. So maxwidth was minwidth -
1. Solved this by not adding negative widths to the ongoing width
value during formatting.

Uses of fprintf(stderr, ...) for production code replaced with calls
to usrtrc(), which depends upon Fresco$Trace being set in the
environment before it prints anything.

Made adding a word where LINE_BREAK and NO_BREAK are both set clear
the NO_BREAK flag. I don't think this is ideal, but <LI> handling is
getting a real mess now, as Si's changes broke some cases as well as
fixing others :-(

http://www.microsoft.com/corpinfo/ fails due to formatting get
maxwidth < minwidth when lots of align=left and align=right
items. Ahhh, 4 hours and it's yet another bug of someone elses.

HEY FOLKS - TAKE YOUR DEBUGGING OUT ONCE YOU'RE DONE WITH IT. PLEASE!!!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

23rd September 1996. Borris

Minor tweaks to remove debugging and SGML reporting to generate 1.30
version.  -Fn enables function name embedding within the objects
produced (the revese meaning of the flag as I had previously
understood it). This should be removed manually when producing a
production version. It must be enabled to produce debugging versions
as the heap uses caller() which examines these embbeded names. I can't
figure out how to do this automatically.

Minor tweaks to remove debugging and SGML reporting to generate 1.30 version.

PRODUCTION, no SGML_REPORTING:		365484
ditto and no function names:		342736
DEVELOPMENT=2, no SGML_REPORTING:	425372

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

22nd September 1996. Borris

Finally tracked down and fixed a bug in slack width sharing. Phew! I
don't want to do this again. This permits the code to handle a table's
width forcing the table to grow beyond maxwidth of all the cells to
work correctly. Fixed another table width bug.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

20th September 1996. Borris

Merged SI_960919

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

20th September 1996. Simon

Fiddled with line breaks.
text_item_ensure_break() only works if it is not following a BULLET object.

text_item_push_break() sets a flag to say that BR was used and only does
something if previous word didn't have a LINE_BREAK or did have an
EXPLICIT_BREAK. This stops <LI>Line 1<BR><LI>Line 2 having a double
space between lines.

removed ensure_break from pre_open_markup unless block level element.

Made url_escape_cat/to_file not escape a few safe characters.

Added new status type for redialling.

Added new flag to tables in attrconf flag manual break. This disables any
break entering that may be done in deliver.c and leaves it up to the
start/finish code to handle it.

Added a bit to backend_doc_complete to stop page scrolling down to first
text item.

Made image default to BOTTOM.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

19th September 1996. Simon

Fiddled a bit more with otext.c selection box handling. Change
backend_update_link to only cause redraw when selected flag actually changes.
Fixed printing error handling, added a missing check and a call to abortjob().
Added some missing frees to table stuff in rid.c

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

19th September 1996. Borris

Serious attack on captions - fixed numerous inconsistencies and
finally decided upon how the border/spacing/padding values are spread
around to keep things easy and consistent.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

18th September 1996. Borris

Shuffling code for TFOOT working. Correct setting of group border
flags.  Use these group border flags in cell border drawing code. Also
do 3D shaded cell borders iff no image background or colour.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

17th September 1996. Borris

Merged SI_960917.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

17th September 1996. Borris

Resulting merged fresco goes boom early during execution.

Moved top line of cell border down one pixel. TFOOT handling.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

16th September 1996. Borris

Merged SI_960916. Note triggers a second tag for the day!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

16th September 1996. Simon

Fixed bug in new comments code, didn't handle ---> properly.
Made parse_integer return integer (0) rather than none with bad input and
parse_colour_tuple accepts comma separated values.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

16th September 1996. Borris

Made change so that FLAG_FULL_UNWIND on an element overrides the
normal close behaviour of stopping at a container. Intended for frames
use, but might be applicable elsewhere.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

16th September 1996. Borris

Merged SI_960913.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
13th September 1996. Simon

Added disposal routines for auth, cache, pluginfile.

Fixed bug in animations (not settting build mask bits when an intermediate
frame doesn't have a mask). And in plotting 16 into 32bpp, didn't realise
it needed to do plot scaled still. And in plotting to rectangle pixel modes.

Added bit to dir2html to swap / to . if the UNIXY define is set.

Added code to fmt_deliver_space() to ignore space if the previous word in
the stream had a space at the end. This fixes the situation where lots of
markup separated by spaces will get lots of spaces rather than just one,
eg <B> <A HREF= > Text </B> </A> .

Changed makeerror to copy the formed error into a messagetrans block to
avoid error overwriting.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
12th September 1996. Simon

Enabled the new comments code. Fixed flexmem imbalance in new animation code.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

13th September 1996. Nicko

**** Warning: Incompatable changes in interface.h ****

I have changed a couple of things in interface.h.  Firstly, the
frontend_view_status() call has been modified to pass information in a
more efficient manner and also to pass the information in more of a
'raw' form.  In general the information not converted into a string
and passed but is instead sent in its original form and the frontend
now converts it into something readable.  The call is now better
documented in the header file.  The other major change is that
backend_item_pos_info() now takes the co-ordinates of the pointer
position in variables that are passed by reference.  The contents of
these variables are converted into 'map' co-ordinated when the
call returns.  This lets the frontend tell the user what value
will be sent to a map program if the user clicks.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

12th Sepember 1996. Borris

Merged SI_960911.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

11th September 1996. Simon

Fixed couple of bugs in imagemaps. DEFAULT wasn't recognised without a COORDS
attribute and it was being checked only after all other areas, which is
probably not what people expect.
Altered caching code to not return the file name of a file that couldn't
be deleted.(eg after a crash).
Added checking for set-cookie headers into the bit with the Location: header.

Changed comment sections of state machine to handle legal comments and
not illegal one (rather than the other way around as they are at present)
however this is defined out at the moment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

11th September 1996. Borris

Improved clipping code for table cell borders. Fixed <COL
ALIGN=CENTER> bug. Fixed timing of table border adjust in formatting
code. Sorted out table cell divisions better: <TABLE FRAME=...> fully
done and <TABLE RULES=...> done except =GROUPS.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

11th September 1996. Borris

Merged SI_960910.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

10th September 1996. Simon

New animation code working. Then tweaked to get stuff going properly.
Made LISTING do same as PRE.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

9th September 1996. Borris

Merged SI_960909.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

9th September 1996. Simon

Changed state_bad_markup in statemach.c to skip to whitespace, dumping bad
characters, then continue. Old function is now state_really_bad_markup used
in unrecoverable situations (currently bad element name).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

8th September 1996. Simon

Made value_body aharacters in parser/support.c accept almost anything.
Tried a hack in perform_element_close to make NOFRAMES work properly.
New function coords_union in portutil.c
Changed image_callback_fn to pass a wimp_box as well for more efficient
updating (initially for animation).
Added flag (to images.h and interface.h) to say it's an animation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

September 9th 1996. Borris

Tracked down the stupid rid_getprop() bug. Due to realloc() and not
updating previously calculated pointers. Reworked all the relevant
code.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

8th September 1996. Borris

Merged SI_960906.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

6th September 1996. Simon

Fixed parse_http_header to accept 'NAME=;' as a valid element.

Fixed cookie bugs: apparently time() retuns DST not GMT so correct for
that. Cokies weren't being checked for expiry before being sent out.
Made HTParseTime cope with next century dates. Fixed loads of sillies with
domain name matching.

Added a unique message for NCFresco to the list in urlopen.h

Added file_lock() to util.c

Added a new view_status call that is done when doc_complete finishes.

Added OS version to user-agent header. Code is in licence.c if it proves
objectionable. Tricky situation of how to deal with the space in RISC OS...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

6th September 1996. Borris

Merged SI_960905 and two tar files. Made minor casting improvements to
rid_getprop and added TASSERT to starthtml, but don't I think the
rid_getprop() boom has gone yet!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5th September 1996. Simon

Some more plugins work. Added two configure entries (to configgui.c also)
for plugin config file and whether to keep it up to date or not.
Extra valuetype to ensure that non OBJECT attributes for APPLET and EMBED are
marked properly in the parameter file.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

September 5th 1996. Borris

If a table row has over 100% width specified or has 100% specified
with other items on the row, we totally remove the %age specifications
for this line. This isn't ideal, but that's users for you!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5th September 1996. Borris.

New defintions for border, cellspacing and cellpadding now adding up
correctly. Change attrribute used for <TABLE BORDER> in
attrconf. Fixed bug in parsing integer/void attributes. <LI> is the
only pre-break element that is not also a block-level element - this
mean the pre-break flag got lost if there was no word/space to push to
carry the break. Fix applied.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2nd September 1996. Borris

See commonsrc/TABLENOTES for decisions on table border, cellpadding
and cellspacing implementation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4th September 1996. Borris

Merged SI-960904 and SI_960904_TAR.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4th September Simon

extended expiry code to handle images. image_find_flag_CHECK_EXPIRE works
analogously to be_ flag. Some minor changes to ensure flags are passed
through at correct time. access_test_cache now returns whether file is
expired or not. Expiry checks current time and Date: header of file.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

30th August Simon

Support for document expiry.

access.c now parses date, last-modified and expires headers and passes them
to the caching code. cache3.c now writes out a format header to the cache
dump file. Format 2 now includes the header info from access.c. There is
a new flag in each of frontend_open_url, backend_open_url and access_url
to specify whether the expiry date should be checked before retrieving
something from the cache.

Brought !Fresco/frontend.c into line with these changes (look for SJM
markers).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

29th August 1996. Borris

Made justification of table cells not do last when get end of stream
without a line break indicator.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

29th August 1996. Nicko

Statusbar code altered to smooth the rate at which the world turns.

Statusbar code changed to have a 'floating' ANT logo on the right hand
side of the button bar.  Sprites file and templates file changed to
allow this.

Frontend code changed so that views can inherit the flags and history
list from the parent view when they are made using a 'right button'
click.

Backend code change to fix the redraw bug that occured when a
background image shared by two views we flushed from on of the views.

Fixed the bug in tablesize that made tables come out wider than they
needed to be.  It seems Borris fixed this too.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

29th August 1996. Borris

Fixed tables being too wide. Nicko coincidentally also fixed this -
dunno which version survives!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

29th August 1996. Borris

Fixed bug with <COL> and <COLGROUP> not being considered as table
elements and hence triggering insertion of <TD> when they should not.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

29th August 1996. Borris

Merged SI_960828

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

28th August 1996. Simon

Lots of changes in images.c. Split off various bits of code into their own
routines for clarity and code sharing. Added rendering into a cached sprite
for animations. Gave tile code the ability to plot direct from the uncached
sprite again.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

27th August 1996. Borris

Merged SI_960827

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

22nd August 1996. Simon

New flag to rid_scan(). When used with FILTER it starts the search at what
you pass in rather than the next item. Fixes APPLET at start of file problem.
More on object/applet_deliver to ensure only the correct PARAM's and A's are
delivered.
Filled in the shaped anchor code for OBJECT.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

27th August 1996. Borris

Improved handling of unexpected elements between <TABLE> and <TD>.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

23rd August 1996. Borris

Improved unexpected text handling. See fresparse/delivery.c for details.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

22nd August 1996. Borris

Further improved <OBJECT>, <APPLET> etc. Added code to free associated
string data from diverted deliveries.

Merged SI_960822 from BORRIS_960821 into head version.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

21st August 1996. Simon

Nasty bit in elements.c for </P> handling

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

22nd August 1996. Borris

Further improved <OBJECT>, <APPLET> etc.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

21st August 1996. Borris

Merged some changes on the 20th (giving BORRIS_960820) and then a
couple of further changes for objparse etc (giving BORRIS_960821).

Improved sgml_install_deliver() etc handling with context->force_deliver
override flag.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

19th August 1996. Borris

Moved <NOFRAMES> into frames.c and had a stab at putting in the
behaviour that Si wanted. Ditto <APPLET>. Made mechanism more
generic. Started looking at <OBJECT> requirements. Still need to do
string freeing. Notes: nesting and emptiness of elements:

applet: yes
object: yes
frame: empty
frameset: yes
noframes: yes
embed: empty
noembed: yes
param: empty

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

20th August 1996. Nicko

More changes to table sizing. Getting better.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

19th August 1996. Borris

Changes to license string to make it work again. Made colour tuple
parsing accept and ignore whitespace characters within the
string. This had been done once before but seemed to have gone
missing. Hacked new magic string into license.c so that development
versions work.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

16th August 1996. Borris

Merged SI_960816. Fixed some resulting silly bugs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

15th August 1996. Borris

Put versions of suffix_to_file_type() and mime_to_file_type() into
basic1.c for builders so it can link. Removed email headers
accidentally left in at head of objparse.c and ooobject.c

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

14th August 1996. Simon

Lots more OBJECT stuff.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

15th August 1996. Borris

Altered <BR> and <P> behaviour. <TABLE><TABLE> now gives
<TABLE>..<TD><TABLE>. <INPUT MAXLENGTH=N> fixed to actually allow N
characters (rather than N-1)). Made the formatter core take note of
rid_flag_NO_BREAK: clearing or floating override this flag, which
might not be what we want. Made entity munging robust to zero length
strings - these should never be supplied, but it seems someone
(incorectly!) is. MAde default number of columns spanned for
<COLGROUP> to be 1, rather than 0. Adding colhdr after colgroupsection
when there isn't a colgroup now creates one. By the time tidy_table()
is called, all colhdrs *must* have a oolgroup associated - I think
this is actually true now. Did some checking on <BR> and <P>
behaviour. Stripped leading/trailing spaces from A HREF strings.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

13th August 1996. Borris

Removed some old "#if 0 .. #endif" code from hparse.c

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

12th August 1996. Borris

Made unexpected text when last stacked item is a table content item
auto-insert <td> and retry the text.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

15th August 1996. Nicko

Changed access.c so that pages fetched by http{s} with the
access_NOCACHE flag are requested with a 'Pragma: no-cache' header
line to avoid caching on proxy servers.

Altered the frontend.c code so that when a window's work area is reset
it is never made shorter then the visable length of the window.  This
means that if you have a long window open and then you fetch another
long document that comes in slowly you will still be left with a tall
window.

The function backend_item_pos_info has been changed in two ways.
Firstly it now returns a NULL link if a map has no link for a given
position (as opposed to a link that is an empty string).  Secondly the
function now sets the link flag when over a link in a local image map
even if the image itself has not got an anchor.

Fixed the form creation code so that the default method is to GET
rather than to POST.  This got changed with the new parser.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

13th August 1996. Simon

Started OBJECT/APPLET/EMBED implementation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

8th August 1996. Simon

Made otextarea_redraw and oinput_redraw limit to graphics window correctly.
oinput_ was failing if there was nothing to plot (x1 < x0 or y1 < y0) and
otextarea was missing a setup call to gwindow.
New function in util.c for finding box intersections to help out.
Rewrite parse_http_header to cope with quotes around header elements and
generally be a bit safer.
Added CKIDBG for cookie debugging and updated cookie.c and head.c for new
scheme.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7th August 1996. Simon

Changed update region in doc_image_change() to allow correct filtering.
Added STBWEB define to limit deep images in 8bit modes to 8bit.
Moved initial checking for at least one selected OPTION into finishselect()
from oselect.c as it could get it wrong with progressive updates.
Made XMP code call PRE code

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

6th August 1996. Borris

Made builders compile again, then made it do sizing and formatting
operations again. Changes made by Nicko and I to table
sizing. Currently in a broken state.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5th August 1996. Borris

This current point in the revision history (1.39) is missing a large
number of my changes.  Some have been redone, especially the top level
Makefile for bu. The reason for their absence is unknown. Redoing the
changes will probably just lead to further gyp in the future :-((

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5th August 1996 Nicko

A large pile of changes were merged in from Simon by email.

A number of major problems with the tables code were succesfully
papered over.

GIF animation code tweeked a little.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2nd August 1996 Simon

Vertical scaling into ALT display.
IMG BORDER changed to display if link or set to > 0.
new rid function to enumerate form elements, used in forms.c to ensure that
exactly one RADIO button is selected.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
31st July 1996 Nicko

A number of changes have been made to structure of the debug code (the
debug functions are now built by macros becuase there were so many of
them).  Much more of the debugging is now down through macros rather
than with #if DEBUG and this has cut down the level of noise on
development builds.  More work is needed here.

The pointer info code in !Fresco/frontend.c has been changed to deal
correctly with the pointer being over an local image map.

A number of changes have been made to the statusbar code to make it
flicker less.  I have also changed the backend.c image change code to
reduce flicker too (especially with GIF animations).

The templates have been tweeked to a) remove the lock icon and b) stop
the colour names being clickable.  Also, the hideous cludge that THEY
made me put into the config code for the en-mass increment/decrement
of the font sizes has been fixed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
25th July 1996 Simon

Put back my changes into printing.c that cope with splitting large objects
over pages. Conditional on the off-chance that I've missed something
important.

Altered image_handle method to take a reason code. One reason is return handle
as at present. New reason is to abort transfer of image. This is called from
backend_doc_abort(). This looks rather safer that my last attempt at this. All
we need now is for the partially downloaded image to be kept.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
24th July 1996 Simon

Did lots more tweaks on ALT code. Now wraps text properly. And if images are
deferred it ignores all suggested widths and heights and just uses the text.

Put some code in to deal with WIDTH=xx% but it is more complicated than I
thought so they are all ignored for now.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
20th July 1996 Simon

Added SGML expansion of attribute literals

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
19th July 1996 Simon

Made major changes to all the form element handling. All form elements are
now stored in one list and are aliased onto the struct rid_form_element in
the same way as rid_text_item. This now means that all form elements will be
output in the order they appear in the HTML as per HTML 2 spec.

Redid some of the ALT text code to obey any sizes put into the HTML page.
Will now try and wrap the text into the box given if it can. If it doesn't
fit then it just truncates it. Ideally if images are disabled it would abandon
formatting and just use the text as is but it doesn't as yet.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

15th July 1996. Borris

Changed the handling of <P>, <BR> and block level elements again. Now,
every block level boundary will have a single PBREAK item - two block
level elements adjacent will no longer cause there to be two PBREAK
items. <BR> is no longer classified as a block level element for these
purposes.  Multiple blank lines cannot be achieved with consecutive
<P> elements, but multiple <BR> elements will give multiple blank
lines. To do this <BR> can't have a the normal BLE processing as it
must always insert a PBREAK and making it BLE would lead to two
PBREAKs.

Changed the way Makefiles handle builddate.h. A single top level
builddate.h is maintained by the top level Makefile for each child
directory. The top level Makefile is responsible for ensuring this
file gets changed - the child Makefiles are responsible for ensuring
this file gets used.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

15th July 1996. Borris

Updated Fresco's Makefile to ensure that buildstamp gets used.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

15th July 1996. Borris

Merged BORRIS_960711 with Si's diffs of 11th July
1996. stbweb/Makefile is in the main repository tree, but not this
branch (ie yet).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

12th July 1996. Borris

Fixed tab characters in <PRE> mode. Few other fixes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

10th July 1996. Borris

Reworked markup delivery to improve in general and get start of
document correct. Fixed span calculation bug in tables. Fixed <STYLE>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

10th July 1996. Borris

Merged in Si's changes at SI_960719_BRANCH. Still missing stbweb contents
so patch winges brielfy.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

9th July 1996. Borris

Fixed context->state bug in pseudo_html(). Fixed various rowspan=N
and colspan=N bugs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

6th July 1996. Borris

Changes made to the build environment. The different programs that can
be compiled have been enumerated. A program that lies between the
complete application (STBWEB or FRESCO) and the stand alone HTML
checker (HTMLCHECK) has been introduced (BUILDERS). This new target is
the SGML parser and the HTML builders, and allows stand alone testing
of the rid_ structure building. Control of the variant being built has
been tightened up so that a -DDEVELOPMENT=N (N=0,1,2) parameter is
supplied to the program to control all debugging. One of FRESCO,
STBWEB, HTMLCHECK or BUILDERS will be defined to indicate which
program is being built. One of RISCOS or UNIX will be defined to
identify the operating system being compiled for. Not all possible
combinations are supported. A very simple RISC_OSLib compatibility
library has been written.

A number of different programs can be compiled. Two operating systems
are supported. The following identify the variants supported:

FRESCO-RISCOS: fr
	The original, for RISC OS, cross-compiled.

STBWEB-RISCOS: sr
	Set top box, for RISC OS, cross-compiled

HTMLCHECK-RISCOS: hr
	CLI utility to check and correct HTML, for RISC OS, cross compiled.

BUILDERS-RISCOS: br
	CLI utility to test the backend builders (ie a debugging tool)
for RISC OS, cross compiled.

HTMLCHECK-UNIX: hu
	A unix natively built version of HTMLCHECK

BUILDERS-UNIX: bu
	A unix natively built version of BUILDERS

MOST-UNIX: mu
	Compile natively to perform syntax checks, but not attempt to
link any form of executable.

ID	Built-from	Left-in

br	builders	builders
bu	bunix		bunix
fr	fresco		!Fresco
hr	hriscos		hriscos
hu	stdalone	stdalone
mu	unix		N/A
sr	stbweb		!STBWeb

(Sorry for the horrible directories, but we've got some historical
layout and now isn't the time to start monkeying with it.)

Program symbols: FRESCO, STBWEB, HTMLCHECK, BUILDERS, MOST
OS symbols: RISCOS, UNIX

Many table bugs have been removed. Automatic insertion of <TR> to
handle full rows has been added. Recursion doesn't stomp on existing
attributes - a new VALUES is allocated from the stack. This makes
coding easier, less heap traffic and means the state the attributes
are left in doesn't matter (apart from secondary freeing).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5th July 1996. Borris

Made <P> move down an empty line as well as forcing a line break (well
- forces two consecutive line breaks actually). Ensure automatic
insertion of <HTML> by unexpected characters gets cancelled by
<HTML>. Made <STYLE> a "flag no text" element. Changed attrgen.py to
not convert the case of enumerations, so, eg we can have
HTML_LI_OLTYPE_A and HTML_LI_OLTYPE_a defined. attrgen.py will give a
warning when non-upper-case enumerations are encountered during
parsing. More syntax to attrconf - lines starting with a dollar are
magic lines. So far, only $E is defined. This echoes the remainder of
the line to stdout. #if 0'd all the elements no longer being used (ie
those warning of no external declaration).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5th July 1996. Borris

Operating from:

	cvs checkout -D "7/4/96 15:20:00" fresco

as a time, then SI_960704_POINT as a tag on the main trunk and then
SI_960704_POINT_BRANCH as a branch from the trunk. stbweb/Makefile is
missing and Si needs to send me a copy. fresco/Makefile got too
complicated for patch and I need to send Si a new entire
file. fresparse/genproc.c also got too much for patch and I need to
send Si a new entire file.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4th July 1996. Borris

Eventually, branch SI_960704_BRANCH tagged. Needs making into a branch
and getting a checkin so we can work against it. Made a DIST target
to make a distribution release.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3rd July 1996. Borris

Merged in SI_960702_BRANCH branch and Si's patches back into main branch.
Tagged this point as SI_960703_BRANCH, ready for next merge.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3rd July 1996. Borris

Auto open TEXT now works. Nicko's floating image changes and formatting
bug corrections merged. Prior to merging with Si's recent changes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2nd July 1996. Borris

Auto open HTML now works. Fixed OPTION bug. Tidied up forms a little more.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1st July 1996. Borris

Fixed bug stopping anything working - sgmlctx->report.output needed to
hold a valid FILE* for printing parser information.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

30th June 1996. Borris.

Corrected and enabled table alignment setting code. Fixed bug in
<COLGROUP> in attrconf and associated elements.c
code. html/regtests/in/tables1.html now emits the expected
values. Added more regtest entries. Checked them against the
parser. Fixed some bugs as a result. Made printing of attributes in
htmlcheck more regular (%-N to left-align). Moved order preserving
attribute printing from htmlcheck into mainline browser code. Unified
generic_start() and generic_finish(). This might want undoing at some
stage? Added open_within_container() routine to apply as a restrictive
check when implicitly closing elements. Fixes this sort of problem:

Input: <DIV> <TABLE> <DIV> </TABLE>
Buggy: <DIV> <TABLE> </TABLE> </DIV>
Fixed: <DIV> <TABLE> <DIV> </DIV> </TABLE> </DIV>

Generated test cases to catch these. Prototyped auto <BODY> on
unexpected characters in htmlcheck. Seems to behave sensibly with
documents where one would expect it to. Updated some test to use
BGCOLOR attribute instead of BACKGROUND as I was mistakenly using.

Added match_perm_text mode where no markup can ever be
recognised. Used for parsing text files - these now have <BODY><PRE>
at their start implicitly. Made non-whitespace unexpected characters
cause <BODY> to appear - automatic document open, in effect. Assume if
not got markup first, then won't be expecting the <HEAD> section.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

28th June 1996. Borris

Merged SI_960625_BRANCH changes back into SI_960625_MERGED2. Lots of minor
changes to various files by various people to improve things.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

26th June 1996. Borris

Style tags need a better default - current value of zero clashes with the
first item in each enumeration! Gone back to having enumerations for attributes
 starting at one.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

26th June 1996. Borris

Merged in Si's latest changes and did a cvs export to give Si a source
tree to work with. Fixed bug in the reading of table borders. Started
looking and column groups again.  Started doing line gathering for
<TEXTAREA>. Changes rid_textarea_line to use STRING and not
char*. This permits the allocation from the chopper to be the final
allocation. Done <OPTION>. Done <TEXTAREA>. Improved flexibility of
nesting of elements to support "user level not valid" and "internal
level mandatory" closing of elements (eg <OPTION>).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

25th June 1996. Borris

Made some printf()s happier about argument types. Changed all C++ comments
into C comments. For reference, the regexps are:

//\(.*\)$
/\*\1\ */

Made the rest of the printf()s happy. Sorted out virtually all external
function references, etc.

Wrote some HTML to test colspan=0 and rowspan=0 after encountering some
such examples on the net. It is important that each of these tests can be
handled - each has the potential to spin.

Added WIDTH and HEIGHT attribute for table cells. The width is returned via
rid_getprop() as normal. There might be some nasty repurcusions of this,
which we'll have to look for. The height of a text stream is increased if
necessary to meet the (minimum) height specified for any <TD HEIGHT=N>
cells.

Changed element named searching to use bsearch() rather than linear
search for performance reasons. Verified with test suite as exists.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

24th June 1996. Borris

Merged in Nicko's changes. Finished removing warnings about
int/long/ptr etc.  Added more extern definitions for external
functions. Made lots of files include the header files that define
their externals - otherwise could easily have total disagreement about
parameters and yet think everything is fine. This was obviously an
oversight on someones part (far too many times as well :-(((( YUCH!!).
Updated dump.c to provide a bit more information.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

24th June 1996. Borris

Merge of Nicko's merged source tree performed and checked in. Performing the
necessary changes to make compilation succeed. The new meta_info list stuff
has been transplanted. Went through and put extra casts to long into the
source so that gcc on a 64 bit platform doesn't produce loss-of-information
warnings when casting pointers to ints and vice versa. Ideally, all such
numeric types involved would be long as a matter of course, but the
definitions of os_swix et al make this not such a trivial matter.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

18th June 1996. Borris

Fixed bug in sgml_free_context() whereby context->tos was not set to NULL
and freed memory got reused - symptom: second page virtually always failed
with an assertion check.

The first attribute of elements after <IMG> was not being recognised. Due
to spuriuos comma in attrconf. Got past attrgen.py because parsing accepted
empty strings when it shouldn't do. Fixed.

Made reconstruction of attributes preserve source ordering. Simplifies the
regression testing. Tried to avoid N**2 (N=20) overheads for every element
reconstructed! Fixed silly bugs in doing this.

Did a cross build with -M to collect dependency information and added
this to fresco/Makefile

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

17th June 1996. Borris

Prior to parse_enum_void, item zero from attribute and attribute
enerations was reserved to indicate invalid. This is antiquated. Item
zero is now (again) the first attribute and the first enumerated item.
Fixed bug in enumeration parsing. Wrote html/regtests/tests python
program. Starting filling in some test cases.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
