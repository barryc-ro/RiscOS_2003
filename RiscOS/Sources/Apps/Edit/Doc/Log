!Edit implementation change Log
-------------------------------

(This is the implementor's log. The file PublicLog is what should
be available for the public to read, near to a release.)

0.56 - 04th Oct 88
!Run - minor cleanup
txtfind - search past char 0xFF crashed.
txt1 - auto-repeat-page-up/down on v. big files used
  to crash with "fatal t1-1", now fixed.
  (due to multi-page call to movevertical)
txtar - window title buffer increased from 64 to 260 chars
txtedit - made use of xfersend_file_is_safe
          new incompatible xfersend (printing stuff) ignored
cwimp.c.resspr - rebuilt stuff for surviving no Sprites file
edit - experimented with making renaming of !Edit possible -
       ended up taking it out.
txtedit - fixed bug that made long filenames crash (in settexttitle)

0.58 released - 2nd Nov 88

txtedit - bug in shift-right-click on close on text window
          (used to chop off leaf name, now fixed).

07-Nov-88: cwimp.c.bbc - minor fix to bbc_move, for DSeal.
07-Nov-88: c.txtedit - minor fix to txtedit__goto, using
                       dbox_persist wrong, ADJ outside box caused
                       a crash, fixed.
07-Nov-88: c.edit - check inserted for txtedit_new returning 0 (malloc fail)
                    when creating typed files.
07-Nov-88: c.txtedit - Create->Text menu entry used to produce garbage
                       datestamp, due to uninit variable in
                       txtedit_newwithoptions. fixed.
07-Nov-88: c.txtedit - Create now gives sensible default names to
                       weird types of files.
07-Nov-88: c.txtedit - r-click-on-close reviewed:
                       if file modified, now just does open-parent.
07-Nov-88: c.txtar - 2-pixel kludge when using fonts on line height.
                     worst example I could find - 15-point Trintity.Standard
                     in mode 12 (underline over B-circumflex), requires this much.
                     Many examples require one pixel, below the baseline,
                     as a kludge.
08-Nov-88: templates: spurious "OK" button renamed as "",
                      preventing mysterious meaning of "o" in the Info box.

0.59 released - 9th November 88

09-Nov-88: c.event - crash if malloc failed, fixed.
09-Nov-88: c.eventv, templates: copyright message.

0.60 released with debugging in, 10th Nov 88:
  to chase BCockburn's mysterious crashes.

16-Nov-88: task module - new version, better with ESC.
16-Nov-88: c.message - better checking for when malloc fails.
16-Nov-88: c.txtoptmenu - width/height/margin/spacing not too big.
16-Nov-88: c.txtar - char 127 in system font is OK now.
16-Nov-88: c.txtedit - drag file -> Edit icon -> used not to
                       update title of target to show modified bit.
17-Nov-88: c.txt1 - redraw bug when at top of text, with cursorx!=0
17-Nov-88: c.txtfind - bug in case-sensitive find, could crash.
18-Nov-88: c.txtedit - slight space leak on task deletion fixed
           rare crash from NGardner in 0.60 - in txtedit_findnamedtxt.
             Extra test inserted in txtedit_dispose.
             Window deletion rationalised a little
           c.dboxquery, c.edit - dboxquery cannot fail for lack of
                                 space.
           c.txtedit - rationalise menu use, so that clicking
             on non-leaves does not pull up the dboxes.
           c.txtedit - further tweak to r-click-on-close
             (no parent detectable -> do not close the window instead)
           relobjto - automated construction of !Run file with
             copy of Version file in the header.
           c.txtedit - (optional) overwrite mode
           c.txtedit - (optional) format para on RETURN/click in para width field
             does not contradict wording of user guide.
           c.txtedit, c.txtmisc (optional)
             tab column switch, late extension to spec.
           c.txtedit - found occasional crash!
             in newwithoptions, if file present but load fails,
             incorrect deletion of semi-created txtedit object.

barrier to merging RISC_OSLib/!Edit txt sources: we have done
  conversion to h.msgs independently, using different tag ids.
