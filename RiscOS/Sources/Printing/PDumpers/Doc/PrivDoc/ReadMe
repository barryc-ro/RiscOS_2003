Note:

  PDumperSP is not up-to-date, but contains the rudiments of code for
producing sprite output.

  PDumperIX and PDumperJX are released. They do not as yet print top and
left margins at all (they make no attempt to).
  Once compiled, these files should be copied to the release directory. Then
they should be copied to Printers.!PrinterDP.PDumpers.*

  PDumperIX and PDumperJX allow:

1) error diffused grey/colour output
        (if halftone size is 1 by 1)

2) small (2 by 2) halftones for colour
        (if halftone size is 4 by 4)

3) small (4 by 4) halftones for grey
        (if halftone size is 4 by 4)

4) small (4 by 4) halftones for monchrome
        (if halftone size is 4 by 4)

5) large (8 by 8) halftones for grey
        (if halftone size is 4 by 4)

6) large (8 by 8) halftones for monochrome
        (if halftone size is 8 by 8)
