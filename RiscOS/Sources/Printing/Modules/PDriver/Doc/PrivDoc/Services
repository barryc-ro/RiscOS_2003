Service_PDriverGetSharedMessagesFile (service call &78)
-------------------------------------------------------

Request for the control block for the shared printer driver Messages file.

On entry:               R1 = &78 (reason code).

On exit (not claimed):  R0 to R8 must be preserved.

On exit (call claimed): R0 = address of the shared block.
                        R1 = 0 (implies service claimed).

This service call is issued whenever a printer driver module wishes to use
the shared Messages file common to all the printer drivers. (The file
is Resources:$.Resources.PDrivShare.Messages.)

See ^.Sources.Asm.MsgCode (also ^.Sources.Asm.PDriver to a much lesser
extent) for the block format and usage.
