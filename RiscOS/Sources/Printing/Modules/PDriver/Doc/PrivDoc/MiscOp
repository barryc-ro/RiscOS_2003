PDriver_MiscOp / PDriver_MiscOpForDriver
========================================

  in: r0  = reason code
                   = 0, declare font
                   = 1, remove fonts
                   = 2, enumerate fonts

  if PDriver_MiscOpForDriver;
      r8  = identifier for the driver

 out: V set, r0 -> error block, otherwise as defined by call.

This call allows the processing of misc printer driver operations.  This
call was added under version 3.14 printer drivers and beyond, when used
on drivers prior to this it will generate a SWI not known error.

Reason codes marked with bit 31 clear are processed by the device, any with
bit 31 set are passed through to the device dependant code to be handled.

The first three reason codes are to do with the handling of fonts within
the printer driver environment.  When a no job is selected then they will
set the state for the next job created, if a job is selected then these
values get written to the current job.

Declare font (0)
----------------

  in: r0  = 0 (reasno code)
      r1 -> RISC OS font name (terminated with control code)
      r2 -> Name to associate with it (terminated with control code) / =0 for none
      r3  = word to associate with it
                 bit 0 set => font is resident within device,
                 bit 1 set => font to be downloaded at job start,
                 bit 2 set => font has been downloaded,
            bits 3..31 reserved and should be zero.

The two strings specified are control code terminated, the RISC OS name is
case insensitive and the name associated with this is case sensitive.  All
reserved flags should be set to zero.

If an RISC OS name is already registered then its data will be overwritten
with the new data specified.


Remove fonts (1)
----------------

  in: r0  = 1 (reason code)
      r1 -> RISC OS name to be removed / =0 for all
        
This call allows a RISC OS name to be removed or all names to be zapped.  R1
should be the pointer to the name to be removed or zero if all are to be 
zapped.

No error is generated if all names are to be removed but none are
registered, but an error will be generated if a specific name is being
removed but is not present.


Enumerate fonts  (2)
--------------------

  in: r0  = 2 (reason code)
      r1 -> return buffer
      r2  = size of return buffer
      r3  = number of entries to return
      r4  = handle (for first call set to zero).
 
 out: r1 -> 1st free byte in buffer
      r2  = remaining space in buffer
      r3  = number of entries not copied
      r4  = handle to pass back in to read more

This call lists the known fonts within the printer driver, ie. the
ones defined using PDriver_MiscOp(0).  The data block returned
contains the following data:

       [r1]     = flags word
                        bit 0 set => font is resident within device
                        bit 1 set => font downloaded at job start
                        bit 2 set => font has been downloaded

       [r1+4]  -> RISC OS font name (zero terminated)
       [r1+8]  -> real font name (zero terminated)
       [r1+12]  = reserved for future expansion

        ..... 

The strings pointed to by r1+0 and r1+4 should be copied away as the
data is only safe during the jobs existence, and may change at
any moment.
