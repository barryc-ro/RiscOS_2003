 Colour printer calibration:

 There are two steps to printer colour calibration:

   1)  Get the true RGB colours for the 8 colours (black, red, green,
yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white). On a printer test card this requires 8
splodges of colour.

   2)  Get the ink circle overlap between adjacent dots vertically and
horizontally. This can be done for each of 7 colours (not white) or just for
black, by printing half-tone cells of size 2 by 2, with 3 black 1 white, 2
black 2 white, and 1 black 3 white, to get some measure of the spread of
each dot.

 Once these values have been worked out it should be possible to find the
true RGB values of every half-tone pattern of the following types:

  1)  Four dots all the same colour             (8)
  2)  Three dots one colour, one dot another    (8.7)
  3)  Two dots one colour, two dots another     (8.7) / 2
  4)  Two dots one colour, one another, and one more
        a colour different from the other two   (8.7.6) / 2

                                Total:          260

 These 260 colours are the palette of the printer. Colours can be selected
from this palette in the same way as ColourTrans. In this way any of the 260
possible colours may be printed onto the page. If the true RGB colours
generated by the calibration front-end are accurate enough, then pretty good
consistent colour approximation throughtout the system may be achieved. It
could well happen thsat 4 of the 260 colours are just ignored, so that a
palette of 256 colours is used.
