> Text.Gamma correction.

       I have implemented gamma correction on the Integrex (because it was
easy, once I found out how); it does indeed give what I'd consider better
results, in that the colours tend to be brighter. Blues and greens are still
darker than they appear on the monitor; we should compare our output to that
of (Pro)Artisan, and, if theirs is still significantly better, barter for
their code.

     I note that our colour PostScript output will be dark, very like the
first Integrex dumps, since PostScript will expect "correct" RGB
coordinates; we should aim to test the colour PostScript ASAP, to see if
gamma correction should be applied to that too.

     Apparently, brightnesses (as calculated in the monochrome dumps) should
also be gamma corrected; this is probably worth trying at some point, as
I've noticed that dot matrix dumps have a tendency to over-blacken the
darker tones.
