 
History since 3.10 of Printer driver independent code
=====================================================
     
3.11 (13-May-1991)
 Removed error checking from vector interception, controlled by flag.

3.11 (14-May-1991)
 Added handling of transformed sprites.

3.11 (16-Jun-1991)
 Changed specification of PDriver_DeclareFont.

3.11 (01-Jun-1991)
 Changed internationalisation code, made more saine.
                                               
3.11 (03-Jun-1991)
 Defined and had a stab at new PDriver_MiscOp SWIs.
 Added passing back of PDriver_MiscOps to back end code.

3.11 (04-Jun-1991)
 Improved errors returned by PDriver_DeclareFont outside job area and whilst
 printing a page.
 Improved errors returned by PDriver_MiscOp.

3.11 (07-Jun-1991)
 Added new handling of the PDriver_MiscOp SWIs.
 Now copies font list to job record and frees at suitable points.

3.13 (10-Jun-1991)
 Added extended ColourTrans_SelectTable call.
 Added calling of PaletteV where required.

3.14 (11-Jun-1991)
 Changed handling of PDriver_MiscOp about a bit, now a new SWI to
 handle direction of calls directly to the device.
  
3.14 (17-Jun-1991)
 Some more bits on transformed fonts.

3.14 (27-Jun-1991)
 PDriver_SetDriver added.

3.14 (01-Jul-1991)
 New justification code, old style rubout calculated differently.

3.14 (05-Jul-1991)
 Semi-working shell for transformed fonts finished, design finalised.

3.14 (04-Jul-1991)
 Fixed R8 corruption in handling of MiscOp add font, caused BASIC to fail.

3.14 (05-Jul-1991)
 Recoded old style coordinate decoding to be more acurate.
 Justification on old style calls goes via the coordinate block.
 Removed some bonus workspace allocations.

3.14 (07-Jul-1991)
 Changed PDriver_DeclareFont to allocate buffer from Font_ReadDefn rather than using a fixed size one; needs Font Manager 2.93.
 Bug fix: font paint handling returns errors correctly.
 New end coordinate calculation intergrated.
 New source structure adopted.

3.14 (08-Jul-1991)
 Handling of rubouts fixed.
 Bug fix: Calculate end position fixed.

3.15 (11-Jul-1991)
 Now sets the matrix bit based on check to see if an identity matrix is setup.

3.15 (16-Jul-1991)
 Title restored back to original.

3.15 (17-Jul-1991)
 Bug fix: Matrix bit correctly setup - bad compares.
 Bug fix: ColourTrans_SelectTable on brian damaged sprites works again (correct mask used in AND).

3.16 (21-Jul-1991)
 Rubout setup handled correctly - fontpaint_ruboutstart / end setup to contain points for rubout.
 Bug fix: Calculation of end point (for next paint) uses fontpaint_flags, not fontpaint_initflags - this means
          that the matrix bit is correctly passed through.

3.16 (22-Jul-1991) 
 Updated the description of PDriver_Info to reflect the new bit fields.

3.17 (25-Jul-1991)
 Bug fix: enumerate fonts works again correctly.
 Bug fix: PDriver_Reset removes the current font list aswell.
 Bug fix: Reading the palette uses correct mask + ORR to convert from &B0G0R0 -> &BBGGRR.

3.17 (27-Jul-1991)
 Split sources for PDriver into many sections.

3.17 (05-Aug-1991)
 Bug fix: Old style justification routines within the Font_SWI - cures DTP problem.

3.18 (30-Aug-1991)
 Changed handling of ColourTrans_SelectTable to comply with new specification.
 Added two new vector table entries for new SWIs to ColourTrans.
 Added new control bit on MiscOp_AddFont to allow overwriting of existing entries.

3.19 (11-Sep-1991)
 Bug fix: ColourTrans_SelectTable

3.20 (03-Mar-1992)
 Updated the ColourTrans handling to be more in step with reality.
 Modified so no need to assume the default palettes - uses ColourTrans_GenerateTable.
 
3.24 (31-Mar-1992)
 Bug fix: Service reset does not corrupt R3,R4.

3.25 (15-Apr-92)
 ColourTrans_SetFontColours now accepts -1 as a font handle, this is due to a bug
   in RISCOS_Lib where it actually passes this in to stop the font handle from
   being changed, except all the documentation states 0.  What a pain in the bottom!
