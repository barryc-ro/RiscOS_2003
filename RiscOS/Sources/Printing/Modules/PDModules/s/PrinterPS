;; *********************************
;;
;; 27-Jul-88        DJS  File created.
;; 19-Aug-88        DJS  PDriver_SetInfo and PDriver_SetPageSize added.
;; 26-Aug-88        DJS  Interface changed to allow multiple rectangles to be
;;                         printed on one page.
;; 22-Sep-88  0.00  DJS  PDriver_CancelJob added.
;; 19-Oct-88  0.01  DJS  Pre-released: does not include font handling and
;;                         miscellaneous other calls.
;; 21-Oct-88  0.02  DJS  PDriver_GiveRectangle interface changed:
;;                         (a) R4 contains background colour on entry;
;;                         (b) Overlapping rectangles effect defined.
;; 03-Nov-88        DJS  Fonts done.
;; 04-Nov-88  0.03  DJS  Released - all characters are black.
;; 07-Nov-88  0.04  DJS  Released - character colours, justification, etc.,
;;                         work.
;; 10-Nov-88  0.05  DJS  Released - rubout boxes, Wimp error reports dealt
;;                         with.
;; 21-Nov-88  0.06  DJS  Released - improved error handling, triangle caps.
;; 25-Nov-88  0.07  DJS  Released - VDU 5 text working, most remaining sprite
;;                         calls in place but doing the same as PutSpriteXXX
;;                         at present.
;; 30-Nov-88  1.00  DJS  Released - all calls that are going to be done in
;;                         this major version have been done.
;;                           * VDU dotted lines print as solid.
;;                           * ECFs produce an essentially random colour.
;;                           * OS_SpriteOp PaintCharScaled not done.
;;                           * Font and sprite VDU sequences not done.
;; 02-Dec-88  1.01  DJS  Released - main change is that all PSprolog2
;;                         operators are put in a dictionary called 'PDdict'
;;                         rather than being dumped in 'userdict' - this
;;                         avoids possible DictFull errors.
;; 06-Dec-88        DJS  Added PostScript-specific debugging information.
;; 06-Dec-88  1.02  DJS  Released - fixed bug to do with multiple pages not
;;                         working in printer-independent code.
;; 12-Dec-88        DJS  Added debugging to use of OS_ReadEscapeState in
;;                         PostScript printer-dependent code. Ditto to check
;;                         returns from OS_BPut.
;; 13-Dec-88  1.03  DJS  Released - various error handling bugs fixed.
;; 14-Dec-88  1.04  DJS  Released - escape and OS_WriteC handling corrected
;;                         during 'pagebox_setup' and 'pagebox_nextbox'
;; 14-Dec-88  1.05  DJS  Released - uses of save/restore vs. gsave/grestore
;;                         made more sensible.
;; 19-Dec-88        DJS  Text and co-ordinate system speed-ups added (with
;;                         conditional assembly to disable them).
;; 20-Dec-88  1.06  DJS  Released - text speed-ups not included. Two bugs
;;                         with VDU 5 character slaving fixed.
;; 13-Feb-89        DJS  Changes written to not use colour bounding boxes
;;                         when printing sprites, in attempt to avoid "sprite
;;                         thin line" problem.
;; 15-Feb-89        DJS  "Sprite thin line" problem tracked down to a
;;                         PostScript bug. Knowledge of this bug used to
;;                         produce a better fix for the problem.
;; 15-Feb-89  1.07  DJS  "Version 1.07" is a pair of modules made available
;;                         to people unofficially. No formal release 1.07
;;                         exists.
;; 20-Feb-89  1.08  DJS  Run-length encoding of sprite data added and
;;                         unofficially released.
;; 22-Mar-89        DJS  Changes made for Encapsulated PostScript and
;;                         structuring conventions 2.1 compatibility:
;;                         (a) First output line changed to "%!PS-Adobe-2.1".
;;                         (b) '%%For' comment split into '%%For' and
;;                             '%%Routing' comments.
;;                         (c) Clipping modified to use 'gsave'/'grestore'
;;                             rather than 'initclip'.
;;                         (d) 'Copies' modified to print the specified
;;                             number of copies (using 'showpage') without
;;                             permanently modifying '#copies'.
;;                         (e) Second argument of '%%Page' comment changed
;;                             to be page position in output, not in
;;                             document.
;; 23-Mar-89  1.09  DJS  Above continued:
;;                         (f) '%%BoundingBox' and '%%PageBoundingBox'
;;                             comments added.
;; 04-Apr-89        DJS  SWI's PDriver_SelectIllustration and
;;                         PDriver_InsertIllustration added, plus PostScript
;;                         specific code to produce EPSF output when a job
;;                         is started with PDriver_SelectIllustration.
;; 11-Apr-89  2.00  DJS  Released.
;; 12-Apr-89  2.01  DJS  Released - changes are (a) graphics windows are no
;;                         longer rounded to screen pixel boundaries;
;;                         (b) "%%Creator:" comment changed to distinguish
;;                         module output from application output.
;; 13-Apr-89  2.02  DJS  Bug fixed - the colour on the first non-text object
;;                         after some text was being set, then immediately
;;                         destroyed when the co-ordinate system was changed
;;                         over. Fixed by delaying the colour setting.
;; 21-Apr-89  2.03  DJS  Bug fixed in printer-independent source: SWI
;;                         ColourTrans_SetFontColours was managing to
;;                         enable ESCAPEs twice, losing the first set of
;;                         old values, then return them to the second set
;;                         of values twice. Fixed by adding a nesting counter
;;                         to 'enableescapes' and 'disableandcheckescapes'.
;; 27-Apr-89        DJS  Assembly time switch to get the printer driver to
;;                         decide what flatness to use for itself added and
;;                         turned on.
;; 02-May-89        DJS  Printer-independent code bug fix: the routine
;;                         "fontswi_setcolours" now forces its R1 and R2
;;                         parameters into the range 0-15, unless they are
;;                         -1 (meaning "no change") to start with.
;; 02-May-89  2.04  DJS  Printer-independent code bug fix: "interceptcolour"
;;                         no longer generates persistent errors or enables
;;                         ESCAPEs on ColourTrans calls it isn't interested
;;                         in (in particular, on ColourTrans_InvalidateCache
;;                         calls).
;; 03-May-89  2.05  DJS  Minor changes to ColourTrans call handling in the
;;                         printer-independent code.
;; 15-May-89  2.06  DJS  Changed to stop illustration jobs outputting the
;;                         non-EPS-compatible setup section. Also integrated
;;                         with NRaine's bug fixes.
;; 14-Jul-89        DJS  Assembly time switch between use of PDriver$Dir and
;;                         PDriver$Path added.
;; 26-Jul-89        DJS  Printer-independent code added to force justified
;;                         Font_Paint's to be horizontal, controlled by
;;                         assembly time switch.
;; 27-Jul-89  2.07  DJS  "BeingDeveloped" assembly time switch moved from
;;                         sources.PDriver to sources.PrinterXX.
;; 30-Aug-89  2.08  DJS  Various clean-ups in the printer-independent code
;;                         to handle font colours.
;; 19-Mar-90  2.40  GJS  Recompiled for release
;; 08-Jun-90  2.41  GJS  Recompiled for release
;; 18-Jun-90  2.20  GJS  Recompilation as 2.20 for Fox
;; 04-Jul-90  2.42  GJS  Recompilation for new pdrivers
;; 23-Jul-90  3.00  GJS  non-SWI version
;; 23-Jan-91  3.05  OSS  Fixed 2.08 fix - use TEQ instead of CMP (was setting V bit)
;; 12-Mar-91  3.05  OSS  Changed encapsulated postscript version numbers in Manage Job.
;; 09-Apr-91  3.06  OSS  Started internationalisation.
;; 19-Apr-91  3.08  OSS  Finished internationalisation.
;; 10-May-91  3.10  DDV  Fixed to work with new independent code.
;; 14-May-91  3.11  DDV  Added shell for transformed sprites.
;; 03-Jun-91  3.12  DDV  Added code to handle device MiscOps.
;; 
;; Lots of missing log information... well done!
;; 
;; 30-Aug-91  3.18  DDV  Intergrated with new Core files.
;; 30-Oct-91  3.24  SAH  Kerning
;; 11-Nov-91  3.25  SAH  Transformed sprites and source clipping fully supported
;; 10-Dec-91  3.26  SMC  Shortened message tokens
;; 20-Feb-92  3.27  SAH  Invalidate stacked font handles on Font_LoseFont
;; 10-Mar-92  3.28  SAH  Automatic accent generation at PostScript runtime.  Implemented
;;                       inside the main prologue, but needs a tiny bit of support in
;;                       PageBox (which sets a new flags bit in the call to MakePSFont).
;;                       Requires MakePSFont 1.02 or above.
;; 31-Mar-92  3.29  DDV  Bug fix: Service_Reset corrupting registers R3,R4
;; 13-Apr-92  3.30  SAH  Bug fix: got the wrong fontpaint flags
;;                       Bug fix: didn't clip to the paper margins
;; 23-Apr-92  3.31  SAH  Add a new bit in PDriver_SetDriver.  Bit 2 set => auto-accent generation
;;                       is required, clear => not wanted.
;; 17-Aug-92  3.32  SAH  Fixed PAR in prologue file so that the parallelogram's coordinates are scaled
;;                         properly (blush)
;;                       "Fixed" transformed-sprite-into-parallelogram so that the default
;;                         source rectangle is upside-down.  This is for bug-compatibility
;;                         with SpriteExtend.
;; 21-Sep-92  3.33  SAH  PDriver$PSextra not being output for new-style prologues or illustration jobs!
;;                       Do the device setup on illustration jobs too; whilst this is not correct
;;                              EPSF practice, at least people's Draw documents will print correctly!
;;                       I -> IT for underlined transformed text
;; 23-Oct-92        SAH  New, much better, version or PAR.
;; 30-Oct-92  3.34  SAH  PDriver_SelectJob (+Illustration) corrupted R7.  (Core.SWIs).
;; 26-Mar-93  3.35  SAH  PDriver_DeclareFont (Core.SWIs) corrupted SP & flags when used in the "font handle" mode
;; 06-Jul-93  3.36  SAH  PSEpilog facility added - a file to be output as job trailer.
;; 03-Aug-93  3.37  SAH  Made R7 argument to Font_Paint work.
;; 09-Sep-93  4.00  SAH  Significant changes to support Medusa platforms, particularly with regard to
;;                         support for 16 and 32bpp screen modes and sprites - see the file "PrivateDoc.MedusaPS".
;;                       Bug fix: the "better" version of PAR had a bug!  It didn't work if the
;;                         sprite had been flipped by setting the source clipping with min > max.
;;                       Bug fix: transformed sprite thru a matrix with source clipping now correctly
;;                         mimics the (rather odd) OS behaviour, which is to say the chosen portion of the
;;                         sprite is plotted at the same position it would have been plotted at if
;;                         no source clipping had been performed.
;;                       Bug fix: undid the change made in 3.33 (which made the device setup code
;;                         get sent for illustration jobs; see above.  Device setup code is once
;;                         again only sent for PDriver_SelectJob jobs.
;; 05-Oct-93  4.01  SAH  Bugfix: use stringwidth (not bounding box) when calculating justification
;;                         offsets.  This is because the bounding box returned by Font_ScanString
;;                         does not include the distance moved by 'move' control sequences at the
;;                         start and end of the string.
;; 02-Nov-93  4.02  PAH  Bugfix: Pressing escape on Medusa could lead to strange error messages,
;;                      this was because the error buffer (part of the job's ws) was freed before
;;                      the message is displayed (In accordance with PRM). Unfortunately 
;;                      the new error module then overwrites this bit of memory.
;; 29-Nov-93  4.03  SAH  Bugfix: set output file extent to 0 when the job is aborted,
;;                         This stops pages being printed when background printing is on.
;; 30-Nov-93  4.04  SAH  Bugfix: the option to pass the initial font handle in via R0
;;                         did not work because it got corrupted before it was used.
;;  8-Dec-93  4.05  PAH  Bugfix: fixed 2nd stage of jumbled error message when pressing escape
;; 10-Jan-94  4.06  SAH  Bugfix: stop division by zero when using very small vdu5 text
;; 10-Jan-94  4.07  SAH  Expand the time and date with OS_ReadVarVal rather than GSTrans;
;;                         this is to avoid provoking the re-entrancy problem that sometimes
;;                         occurs when GSTransing the time variables.
;; 19-Jan-94  4.11  JSR  Up version number only - change was in MakeFile install dependancy
;; 20-Jan-94  4.12  PAH  Bugfix: Printer name was lost if PdriverInfo was called in middle of
;;                        job
;; 01-Feb-94  4.13  PAH  Bugfix: Colourtrans_selecttable only behaves differently with R5 bit 4
;;                        set when source is either 16 or 32bpp
;; 17-Feb-94  4.14  SAH  When plotting 256 colour full-palette sprites, use the supplied
;;                        translation table - not the sprite's palette - unless bit 4 of
;;                        R5 is set.
;;                       Check for ESCAPE when plotting truecolour sprites
;; 18-Feb-94  4.15  SAH  The above fix for sprite plotting was not complete.  Now the
;;                        core files correctly preserve bit 4 or R5.  Also the interpretation
;;                        of this bit for PS printing is now as follows:-
;;                          If set: use sprite's palette providing it is has the same number
;;                            of entries as the sprite's mode has colours
;;                          If clear: use user-supplied translation table.
;;                        This differs slightly from the behaviour of SpriteExtend which
;;                        ALWAYS uses the palette of a 256 colour full-palette sprite.
;;                        The different behaviour in PS printing is necessary for Impression's
;;                        colour separation to work properly.
;; 09-May-94 AMG 4.16 Bugfix: (Core) Don't use bignum as default terminator to string in
;;                      intercepted font_paint - caused immediate termination if string to
;;                      be printed was in rma on a Risc PC (rma is at &02100000 but bignum
;;                      is only &02000000)
;; 09-Aug-94 SMC 4.17 Fixed MED-03324: only output CTRL-D at the end of a job if it was not
;;                      an illustration (EPSF file). Epilogue still applied to all jobs.
;; 12-Sep-94 AMcC 4.21 Version is now set in shared Version file (version number now in
;;                       line with SrcFile).
;; 13-Sep-94 MJS  4.22 Changes for JPEG plot support
;; 30-Sep-94 MJS  4.23 More JPEG changes, mainly in DP section (linked version numbers)
;; 21-Oct-94 MJS  4.24 Support for 'wide' translation tables on Sprite plot
;; 25-Oct-94 MJS  4.25 Footling change - use proper global symbols for JPEG SWI's
;; 23-Nov-94 MJS  4.28 refuse to initialise if PDriver not active - ie. be dormant in ROM,
;;                     provided PDriver is later in chain
;; 25-Nov-94 MJS  4.29 Give proper error message if PDriver not active
;; 06-Jan-95 MJS  4.31 Fix broken PDriver_CheckFeatures (MED-04276)
;; 31-Jan-95 MJS  4.32 Fix translation-in-transformation for Font_Paint (MED-04323)
;; 31-May-95 PJC  4.36 Changed PageBox so that it inserted files for feed and paper rather
;;                     than the contents of PDriver$PSextra
;; 15-Jun-95 PJC       Changed it again so that it will still do PDriver$PSextra. Printer Manager
;;                     just ensures that currently, this variable is empty.
;; 10-Jul-95 MJS  4.37 Additions for Level 2 capability, via flag in R0,bit 3 of PDriver_SetDriver
;;                     (1=Level 2). Currently, Level 2 only influences bitmap images. Generally
;;                     faster, because of output buffering.
