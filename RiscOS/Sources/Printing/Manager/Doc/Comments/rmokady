 William,

  Following is a list of printer problems as promised. I've tried to divide
the problems into areas, bu as I have not investigated any of them in depth,
some may be in th wrong group.

  I have on my desk a substantial file with more detailed description of the
problems.        

             

General
--------

 1. Printer drivers are slower than 2.00 ones.

 2. Font_Paint corrupts flags when printing to printer.

 3. Problems with justified text and TABs.  (Font Manager ?)

 4. Problems with indented text and margins. (Font Manager ?)


!PrintEdit
-----------

 2. Setting paper offsets is far from obvious.


Printer definition files
------------------------

 1. Many of the defaults provided are wrong.

 2. Max colour resolution on LC200 is 120x72, used to be more on RO2
drivers.

 3. Margins for LaserJet are wrong.

 4. No Panasonic printer definitions or directory.


!Printers front end.
--------------------

 1. Message PrintFile from !Printers in response to a DataLoad message does
not include the Scarp file name.

 2. If you load 2 copies of the same printer definition, delete one of them,
and edit the other you get "Abort on data transfer".
                                                    
 3. Setting margins in !Printers doesn't work.


 
PDumpers back ends
------------------

 1. Applications which used to print OK on 2.00 PDrivers now print grey
instead of white. (Seems to only happen on DM printers, we haven't managed
to reproduce it yet.)

 2. Staggered printing problem. The top half of a line of text does not
always match the bottom half !

 3. Dots on left hand side of printout, does not happen with !PrinterDM.


LserJet
-------

 1. Problems with printing to LaserJet IV printers.

 2. Extra form feed printed on Qume CrystalPrint II.

 3. Tagged image format sometimes has incorrect length.


General OS incompatibilities
----------------------------

 1. Printer buffers no longer work.

 2. Using ADVAL(-4) to detect printer on line no longer works.

 
PostScript
-----------

 1. Problems with typesetters.

 2. Problems with font encodings for symbol fonts.


Colour Printing
---------------

 1. Colour calibration code does not work.

 2. Insufficient dithering resolution.

 3. 24 colour printing (this is really in Jonathan's domain !)



  I have spoken to Jonathan about the colour printing work, and how it is
divided between us and the Victoria project. We agreed that a version of the
printer drivers supporting the first two points should be made available
long before a printer driver that supports the third point is required for
Victoria.

  We are already paying Tony to do the first two parts. Jonathan agreed
coordinate the work that Tony is doing, and to aim for printer drivers
supporting the first two points to be delivered to us ASAP. This will be
independent of any other work that he requires Tony to do.


                Ran.
