Ran / David

to add to your list of
printer problems.

1. !Printers must be available in drive.

Om Single floppy machines the requirement to have !Printers
in the drive is a problem. It should not
be necessary to go back to !printers once the 
application has been loaded. The !Scrap directory
should be sufficient for any scrap files.
It currently appears that !Printers is required whenever a print
out is started.

The application is 190k which is a large chunk of
a 800k workdisc, not to mention the problems of
haveing a copy on all work disc, and getting Printers$dir
to be set to the currently installed disc.
