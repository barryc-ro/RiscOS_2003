    on printer connections window:
      <> SCSI printer           (has Victoria got one yet?)
                                (assume what SCSI device number?)
                                (ask SCSI device for its description?)
      under 'file':
        [] append to file
        [clear file]
      [] spool via temporary file
    Cancel buttons on 'connections' and 'config' and 'paper size' boxes.
    No close boxes on the above either - they are dboxes.
    Add 'connections' and 'configuration' to root menu
    Drag a printer description onto printer icon -> define it, show it.
    Double-click on printer description -> (start !Printers), define it, show it.
    Network usage - can we arrange that !Printers loads in smaller lumps?
      where exactly does the space, and loading time go? Analysis please.
