Wish list for Printers
---- ---- --- --------

   Fix all the bugs, especially ...

      ... short-circuit printing is done even when the queue is paused

      ... deletion iof temporary file at the wrong moment.

   Add features to support other applications which may wish to do their own
printing in null events. This means new messages to allow the user to
specify Abort, Pause and Continue from a Printers menu, and have Printers
tell the application to do the right thing.

   Speed up text printing - just recode the back ends in assembler. A small
matter of programming.

   Better test the variant back-end support.

   It would be interesting to write an app that took a text file and
rendered it (in null events, natch) using Font Mangler calls. Then Printers
could use this for output to Postscript printers, 3rd parties could use it
for direct drive printers, and the user would have one more interesting
conversion utility to play with (this would be "text file -> sprite").
