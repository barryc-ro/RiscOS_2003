This directory contains source code and data files
used to create the special palette '2', which does
ink density correction for Epson stylus Color at 720
dpi.

The chosen parameters are:
  1-ink density = 62.5%
  2-ink density = 62.5%
  gamma = 2.8

Note that PDumperSupport 1.18 is required to properly
notice and use palette '2', and that it contains
code which is optimised for the 2-ink = 62.5% case.

The new PDF's (to select palette 2) are also
required!
