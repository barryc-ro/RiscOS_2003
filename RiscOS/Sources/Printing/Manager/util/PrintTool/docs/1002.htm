Above is the dialogue window that is selected using !Printers to configure a printer.  Under "Printer options" there is a selection for "Resolution" this indictes the type of print quality that is used.  When you wish to change the palette for a particular method of printing take a note of this setting.  Then load the PrintEdit application and drop the PDF on the icon.

This should provide the following window.  The area of interest is the "Graphics modes".  By clicking on the menu to the right of this section you are provided with a list of graphics modes.  These should be identical to that list given in the !Printers control window.  Select the print quality that you are interested in.  This will give a further window.

The only thing of interest is the "palette file" on the left of the top section.  If you have created another palette change only that entry to the new file name.  It is this file name that you will need to enter into the !PrintTool application.  Within the first dialogue window of the PrintTool application is a button allowing you to see your full list of palettes, if you wish to create a new one copy the file featured in the "Palette file" entry below to a new file number not in the directory show in the PrintTool application.  Enter this new number in the entry below.  You can then use the PrintTool application to make minor adjustments or to re-tune the entire palette using the Walkthough facility.
