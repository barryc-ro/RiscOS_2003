<h1>The Walkthrough</h1><br><br>
<p align ="left">
The idea of the walkthrough is to print a series of test images each of these images will indicate a particular aspect of the palette.  You will see the test page in its entirety, however each time you press the 'Print' button one portion of this image will be printed.  This allows you to feed the same sheet of paper through again to save on paper usage.  Each images is designed to highlight an element in the palette.<BR><BR>Under each of the printed images is a numeric scale.  The scale indicates the number to be entered into the palette window.  This value entry will reflect your requirements with the paper and inks you are using.</p><BR><BR>

At the botton if this screen there is a small help window.  This will give a brief message indicating what values are to be entered into the palette and in what location.<BR><BR>If you are using a cartridge that only uses colour inks you should indicate this in the palette by selecting the appropriate radio button in the top left of the window.<BR><BR>
<h3>Colour Cartridges;</h3>If your cartridge is colour only you will not need to print the entire page, this point will be indicated in the help text at the bottom of the page.<BR><BR>
<h3>Cartridges that contain Black Ink;</h3>After the colour inks have been tuned it will then be necessary to tune there relation to black ink.  This relates to the "Grey Level Replacement" values on the palette window.  For a more in depth discussion of this see the help page for the <a href="1003.htm">main dialoge window</a>.  Once you click on the "Contains Black" Cartridge type the three Grey Level values become editable.  The first Item of interest is the starting point.  We choose this from the next printout.  It is selected as the value where the colour starts to become dark enough to hide the more intense black ink, without showing any discolouration.  This may take a couple of prints to get right.  Then is the 50% values, these are chosen to maintain an even gradient to 100% black.  Again this may need to be tried again.  For this reaason there are 6 equivelant printouts at the bottom of the page.  You may not need to use all of them.<BR><BR>
