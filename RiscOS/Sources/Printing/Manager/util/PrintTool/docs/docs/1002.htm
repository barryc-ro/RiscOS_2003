Above is the dialogue window that is selected using !Printers to configure a printer.  Under "Printer options" there is a selection for "Resolution" this indictes the type of print quality that is used.  When you wish to change the palette for a particular method of printing take a note of this setting.  Then load the PrintEdit application and drop the PDF on the icon.

This should provide the following window.  The area of interest is the "Graphics modes".  By clicking on the menu to the right of this section you are provided with a list of graphics modes.  These should be identical to that list given in the !Printers control window.  Select the print quality that you are interested in.  This will give a further window.

The only thing of interest is the "palette file" on the left of the top section.  If you have created another palette change only that entry to the new file name.  It is this file name that you will need to enter into the !PrintTool application.
