This window allows greater control over the palette.  The values that define the greater control here are derived from other values in the simplified window.  This help page describes the differences between the two windows.<BR><BR>This window also more closely replicates a command line application that preceeded this, as such the order of which items appear is in a different order than the simplified window.
<h3>Saturation</h3>
<ul>
<li><EM>Error Diffuse Density;</EM>&nbsp;This is the position of maximum ink.  It is used to space the colour map to within a range from 0 to this value.</li><BR>
<li><EM>Brightness</EM>&nbsp;This has two values these are for error diffusion and half-tone methods of colour approximation.  Half-tone has been removed for the simplified window as it is not used in the majority of cases.</li><BR>
<li><EM>Contrast</EM>&nbsp;This exactly the same.</li>
</ul>
<BR><BR>
<h3>Colour Biases and Maximum Levels</h3>
<ul>
<lh>This is again the same as the simplified window.</lh>
</ul>
<BR><BR>
<h3>Grey Level Replacement</h3>
<ul>
<lh>The difference here is the second value.  This value is used as the maximum level, in most cases this is 100%.  For this reason this value is left out from the simplified dialogue.<BR><BR>
Min. Non-Zero Black is the same as "Start replacing at:"
</lh>
</ul>
