!fish.

!!! NOTE !!!
This is development software without design or favour.
This application is not yet finished, not by a long shot.

The purpose of this application is to load NC style PDF files and prime the printer chain.  This allows the
testing of PDF files on a RiscPC.

!!! Usage !!!
Check out the printer resources file from CVS 'RiscSO/Sources/Printing/PrintDefs'.  Run the '!SetResDir' obey
file within this directory this sets resources directory.  Then run '!MkRes' this will copy the printer resources
into a directory in fish called resources.  It is here that fish will look for palettes and paper.  Fish requires
modules to be loaded prior to usage, it will not look for the most recent versions, at least I don't think it will.

Until a means of loading a specific pdf file is implemented you need to drag and drop.  Note double clicking on the
pdf file will break as !Printers will attempt to load it.

To do.

* write a spec.

* there should be a pull down list, or such, which will load a printer definition file from the resources directory based
on number.
* a parser and interface should be added to allow the parsing of RiscPC based PDF files.  Whilst there it might be a good
idea to implement a means of editing these, cut out the BASIC based PrintEdit.
