this directory contains an Excel spreadsheet that was first compiled in 1997
this associates printers with existing pdf files as provided in the resources
directory.

These pdfs are addressed numerically.  This index relates to the RCA build. Specific
printers addressed can be determined by viewing the RCA 'supported' list.

As new printers are supported these should be added to this spreadsheet.  These
additions should not use the numerical index as used above, but name the files
directly.
