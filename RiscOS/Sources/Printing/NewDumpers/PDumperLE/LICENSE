This driver software is owned by Lexmark Inc. and may only be used and
distributed under the terms of the license agreement between Element 14
and Lexmark.  

The master copy of the license is held by Element 14's legal department 
(Chris Edwards, Richard Conway) and should be consulted before any use of
this software.

Note in particular:
   1) The sources may only be used for build/configuration management and
      bug fixes.  They must not be redistributed or used to create new or
      derivative works.

   2) Any bug fixes made by Element 14 must be sent to Lexmark within
      3 days of release of a driver containing the fixes.  Send e-mail to
      digirol@lexmark.com, blambert@lexmark.com, bcavill@lexmark.com, or
      cbinder@lexmark.com.

The driver was ported to RISC OS by a Lexmark sub-contractor (Andy 
Armstrong, andy@tagish.co.uk).  This work was paid for by Lexmark and
the driver supplied to Element 14 free-of-charge.  Lexmark are very keen
to work with us to fix driver bugs and to enhance RISC OS support for the
driver because they expect people who buy the printer and have problems
using it with our system will call the Lexmark customer support line.
