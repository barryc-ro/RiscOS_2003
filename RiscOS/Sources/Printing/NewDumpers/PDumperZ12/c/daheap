/* daheap.c
 *
 * Very simple heap in a dynamic area
 *
 * AA, 9th August 2000: There seem to be problems with this code. Firstly it results in 800k being
 *                      permanently allocated on the NC, but also, much more seriously, when it is
 *                      enabled aborted print jobs cause subsequent data aborts on the next attempt
 *                      to print. It's not known whether there is some specific problem in this
 *                      code or whether the use of this code is exposing an error elsewhere, but
 *                      either way it's not any sort of good ;-)
 *                      The quick fix is to stop using it, which leaves the lingering doubt that
 *                      there's a problem somewhere that hasn't been fully diagnosed. If you decide
 *                      to use this code beware. Conversly if you find a problem elsewhere that
 *                      might explain the data abort when a DA is being used feel free to re-enable
 *                      this stuff and see if it works.
 *
 * AA, 9th August 2000: Found the problems, which were actually in some of the Lexmark cleanup code
 *						so this stuff is off the hook again.
