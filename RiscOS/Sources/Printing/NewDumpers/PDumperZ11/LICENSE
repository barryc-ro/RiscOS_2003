   2) Any bug fixes made by Pace Micro Technology must be sent to Lexmark

The driver was ported to RISC OS by a Lexmark sub-contractor (Andy 
Armstrong, andy@tagish.co.uk).  This work was paid for by Lexmark and
the driver supplied to Pace Micro Technology free-of-charge.  Lexmark are very
keen to work with us to fix driver bugs and to enhance RISC OS support for the
driver because they expect people who buy the printer and have problems
using it with our system will call the Lexmark customer support line.
