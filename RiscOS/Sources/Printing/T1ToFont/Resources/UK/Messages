# Menu description for SAVE menu when there are no Font$Path entries directories
SaveNoDirs:~Please set Font$Path

# The line tagged "Encodings" specifies the contents of the Encodings
# menu.  Each item in it is a further tag which is looked up to obtain
# a name=filename pair.  The name is displayed on the menu and the
# filename is where that encoding is sought.  Encodings are searched
# for under the path T1ToFont:Encodings; see assignment of
# T1ToFont$Path in !Run.  If the filename is set to the special value
# "fontspecific", then rather than looking up the encoding in a file,
# the program attempts to lift it out of the Type 1 file, and if
# successful will leave it in the font directory where the font
# manager and PostScript printer driver will make use of it.
