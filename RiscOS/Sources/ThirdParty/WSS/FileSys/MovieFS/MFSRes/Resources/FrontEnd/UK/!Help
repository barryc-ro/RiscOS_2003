            MovieFS - Alien movie/sample support module for Replay
            ======================================================

Introduction
============
                
MovieFS is an extension of the RISCOS filing system, which allows Replay to
playback films/samples of formats other than its own. (Video for Windows
'.AVI', QuickTime '.MOV', Animator Pro '.FLI' & '.FLC', WaveForms '.WAV',
Psion '.WVE's, AND 'VOC' audio files are supported in this version.)  MovieFS
may be activated from the desktop by double clicking on the !MovieFS
application, whereupon films of supported alien formats can be treated as if
they actually were Replay files: they may be double clicked to run them, or
they may be dragged to any application capable of reading Replay files.  Alien
films are distinguished from true Replay films by a difference in the
appearance of their icons - the alien films have the names of the formats
overlayed across the bottom half of the Replay icon.


Installation
============

The MovieFS installation disc contains the !MovieFS application and an
archive called codecs. These can be installed as follows:

 * The !MovieFS application may be copied to any convenient directory on your
 hard disc.

 * The contents of the 'codecs' archive (i.e. the subdirectories Decomp600,
 Decomp601, ...) must be copied to Replay's !ARMovie directory. To do this,
 open the !ARMovie application, by double clicking its icon with the shift
 key held, and then drag the new codecs to the open application window. (A
 copy of David Pillings excellent SparkPlug program is supplied for this
 purpose.)

MovieFS can access a file only if it has a recognised file type.  In many
cases !MovieFS will set the file type for you when you double click or drag
an appropriate file, but it may be necessary to set the file type manually in
some cases.  For playing movies from CD ROM, you will need to have a version
of CDFS that correctly understands the DOSMAP conventions (MovieFS sets up an
appropriate extension to filetype mapping for you). Unfortunately many
versions of CDFS have a broken implementation of this, and must be patched
with the !Filetypes application.

Recognised filetypes currently are:

	AVI:		&FB2	(AVI)
	Quicktimes:	&FB2	(AVI)
	DL:		&FB2	(AVI)
	ANM:		&FB2	(AVI)
	FLI/FLC:	&B9F	(FLI)
	WVE:		&FB2	(AVI)
	WAV:		&FB1	(WAV)
	VOC:		&FB1	(WAV)
	AIFF:		&FC2	(AIFF)

New filetypes can be added by editing the MovieFS !Boot and !Run files.

The !CDFix and !CD_Types applications are supplied on the disc as a service to
customers and in the hope that it will be useful. It however forms no part of
MovieFS, and may be freely copied and distributed subject to the conditions set
out in the !RunImage.


Adjustments
===========

There are two commands that adjust the behaviour of MovieFS, both offsetting
memory usage against smooth play back.

* MovieFsFillPeriod <decimal number between 0 and 500>

  This command sets the frequency at which Replay reads from a file: the
  number specifies the time between reads in hundredths of a second.
  Higher settings may produce smoother play back, but will cause Replay
  to use larger buffers. The default setting is 200, which is sufficient
  to read from CD ROM, but a smaller value of 100 may also be sufficient.
  When accessing files from hard disc, 60 is perfectly adequate.
  
* MovieFsBufferSize [ 0 | 128K | 256K | 512K ]

  This command sets the size of buffers used within MovieFS.  256K is the
  default, and is probably the optimal value, although experimentation
  is recommended.  If you have CDFast loaded then you may be able to
  save memory by using a setting of 0.

There are several other commands; the first displays your registration details:

* MovieFsRegistration

The second command is used to provide an "Authority File" that specifies which
films MovieFS can and cannot play. This is only relavent in the demo version.

*MovieFSAuthority

The final command is used to add new filetypes to the list that MovieFS knows
about. End users should probably never need to use this one.

*MovieFSAddFileType


Using MovieFS as a translator
=============================

If an alien film is double clicked with the shift key held then it will
open as a directory that contains a Replay film named ARMovie.  This
may be copied (by dragging) to any filer window.  Copies made in this
way are directly useable by Replay without MovieFS being loaded, but still
require the MovieFS decompressors. The decompressors are NOT freely
distributable, and so movies converted in this way cannot be played on
non-MovieFS equipped machines.


Buying the full version:
========================

The full version costs £26.42, (inc P&P, no VAT to pay), available from the
address below, and removes the restrictions on the length of the films you
can play.


Upgrades (for the full version):
================================

As with all Warm Silence Software products, minor upgrades are provided free
of charge, provided a formatted disc and a stamped self-addressed envelope
are included. We reserve the right to charge for major upgrades, but we have
never had to resort to this yet. If in doubt, please feel free to telephone
or email first.

We will happily send discs back in whatever envelope you choose to send us,
but we accept no responsibilty for discs lost or damaged in transit, and we
recommend you use padded "Jiffy" bags.
