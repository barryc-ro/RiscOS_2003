Definitely no. The eye and the ear, even if they are only a few
centimeters apart, works very differently. The ear has a much
higher dynamic range and resolution. It can pick out more details
but it is <I>slower</I> than the eye.
<P> 
The MPEG committee chose to recommend 3 compression methods and named
them Audio Level I, II and III. Level I is the simplest, a 
<A HREF="mpeggloss-s.html#sub-band coding">sub-band</A>
coder with a psycoacustic model.
Layer II adds more advanced bit allocation techniques
and greater accuracy. Layer III adds a hybrid filterbank and non-
uniform quantization plus advanced features like Huffman coding, 18 times 
higher frequency resolution and bit reservoir technique.
Layer I, II and III gives increasing quality/compression ratios with
increasing complexity and demands on processing power.
<P>
The reason for recommending 3 methods where partly that the testers
felt that none of the coders was 100% transparent to all material and
partly that the best coder (Layer III) was so computing heavy that it
would seriously impact the acceptance of the standard.
<P> 
The specs say that a valid Layer III decoder shall be
able to decode any Layer I, II or III MPEG Audio stream. A Layer II
decoder shall be able to decode Layer I and Layer II streams.
<P>
Layer-3 is the <I>only</I> audio coding scheme that 
has been recommended by the ITU-R for the use at 60 kbps channels. 
Layer-3 is widely in use in ISDN networks and other telecommunication 
applications, and various consumer applications (e.g. digital 
satellite broadcasting via Eutelsat or WorldSpace) have decided to 
use it. A Layer-3 decoder chip (that also decodes Layer-2) is 
available from ITT Germany.

Well, first you need to know how sound is stored in a computer. Sound
is pressure differences in air. When picked up by a microphone and
fed through an amplifier this becomes voltage levels. The voltage is
sampled by the computer a number of times per second. For CD-audio
quality you need to sample 44100 times per second and each sample has
a resolution of 16 bits. In stereo this gives you 1,4Mbit per second
and you can probably see the need for compression.
<P> 
To compress audio MPEG tries to remove the irrelevant parts of the
signal and the redundant parts of the signal. Parts of the sound that
we do not hear can be thrown away. To do this MPEG Audio uses psyco-
acustic principles.
<P>
<A NAME="How good is MPEG-1 AUDIO compression"><B>How good is MPEG-1 AUDIO compression ?</B></A>
<P>
MPEG can compress to a bitstream of 32kbit/s to 384kbit/s (Layer II).
A raw PCM audio bitstream is about 705kbit/s so this gives a max.
compression ratio of about 22. <I>Normal</I> compression ratio is more
like 1:6 or 1:7. If you think that this is not much please remember
that unlike video we are talking about no perceivable quality loss
here. 96kbit/s is considered transparent for most practical purposes.
This means that you will not notice any difference between the
original and the compressed signal for <I>rock'n roll</I> or 
<I>popular music</I>. 
For more demanding stuff like piano concerts and such you will need to go 
up to 128kbit/s.
<P>
<A NAME="How does MPEG-1 AUDIO achieve this compression ratio"><B>How does MPEG-1 AUDIO achieve this compression ratio ?</B></A>

Well, with audio you basically have two alternatives. Either you
sample less often or you sample with less resolution (less than 16
bit per sample). If you want quality you can't do much with the
sample frequency. Humans can hear sounds with frequencies from about
20Hz to 20kHz. According to the Nyquist theorem you must sample at
least two times the highest frequency you want to reproduce. Allowing
for imperfect filters, a 44,1kHz sampling rate is a fair minimum. So
you either set out to prove the Nyquist theorem is wrong or go to
work on reducing the resolution. The MPEG committee chose the latter.
<P>
Now, the real reason for using 16 bits is to get a good signal-to-
noise (s/n) ratio. The noise we're talking about here is quantization
noise from the digitizing process. For each bit you add, you get 6dB
better s/n. (To the ear, 6dBu corresponds to a doubling of the sound
level.) CD-audio achieves about 90dB s/n. This matches the dynamic
range of the ear fairly well. That is, you will not hear any noise
coming from the system itself (well, there is still some people
arguing about that, but lets not worry about them for the moment).
So what happens when you sample to 8 bit resolution ? You get a very
noticeable noise floor in your recording. You can easily hear this in
silent moments in the music or between words or sentences if your
recording is a human voice. Waitaminnit. You don't notice any noise
in loud passages, right? This is the masking effect and is the key to
MPEG Audio coding.
Stuff like the masking effect belongs to a science called psyco-
acoustics that deals with the way the human brain perceives sound.
And MPEG uses psycoacustic principles when it does its thing.
<P>
<A NAME="Explain the masking effect"><B>Explain the masking effect</B></A>
<P>
Say you have a strong tone with a frequency of 1000Hz. You also
have a tone nearby of say 1100Hz. This second tone is 18 dB lower.
You are not going to hear this second tone. It is completely masked
by the first 1000Hz tone. As a matter of fact, any relatively weak
sounds near a strong sound is masked. If you introduce another tone
at 2000Hz also 18 dB below the first 1000Hz tone, you will hear this.
You will have to turn down the 2000Hz tone to something like 45 dB
below the 1000Hz tone before it will be masked by the first tone. So
the further you get from a sound the less masking effect it has.
The masking effect means that you can raise the noise floor around a
strong sound because the noise will be masked anyway. And raising the
noise floor is the same as using less bits and using less bits is the
same as compression.
<P>
Let's now try to explain how the MPEG Audio coder goes about its
thing. It divides the frequency spectrum (20Hz to 20kHz) into 32
sub-bands. Each sub-band holds a little slice of the audio spectrum.
Say, in the upper region of sub-band 8, a 1000Hz tone with a level of
60dB is present. OK, the coder calculates the masking effect of this
sound and finds that there is a masking threshold for the entire 8th
sub-band (all sounds w. a frequency...) 35dB below this tone. The
acceptable s/n ratio is thus 60 - 35 = 25 dB. The equals 4 bit
resolution. In addition there are masking effects on band 9-13 and on
band 5-7, the effect decreasing with the distance from band 8.
I a real-life situation you have sounds in most bands and the masking
effects are additive. In addition the coder considers the sensitivity
of the ear for various frequencies. The ear is a lot less sensitive
in the high and low frequencies. Peak sensitivity is around 2-4kHz,
the same region that the human voice occupies.
<P>
The sub-bands should match the ear, that is each sub-band should
consist of frequencies that have the same psycoacustic properties. In
MPEG layer II, each subband is 625Hz wide. It would been better if
the sub-bands where narrower in the low frequency range and wider in
the high frequency range. To do this you need complex filters. To
keep the filters simple they chose to add <A HREF="mpeggloss-f.html#FFT">FFT</A> in parallel with the
filtering and use the spectral components from the <A HREF="mpeggloss-f.html#FFT">FFT</A> as additional
information to the coder. This way you get higher resolution in the
low frequencies where the ear is more sensitive.
<P> 
But there is more to it. We have explained concurrent masking, but the
masking effect also occurs before and after a strong sound (pre- and
postmasking)
<P> 
If there is a significant (30 - 40dB ) shift in level. The
reason is believed to be that the brain needs some processing time.
Premasking is only about 2 to 5 ms. The postmasking can be up till
100ms.
Other bit-reduction techniques involve considering tonal and non-
tonal components of the sound. For a stereo signal you have a lot of
redundancy between channels.
The last step before formatting a Layer-3 stream is 
<A HREF="mpeggloss-h.html#huffman coding">Huffman</A> coding.
<P> 
The coder calculates masking effects by an iterative process until
it runs out of time. It is up to the implementor to spend bits in the
least obtrusive fashion.
For layer II the coder works on 23 ms of sound (1152 samples) at a
time. For some material the 23 ms time-window can be a problem. This
is normally in a situation with transients where there are large
differences in sound level over the 23 ms. The masking is calculated
on the strongest sound and the weak parts will drown in quantization
noise. This is perceived as a <I>noise-echo</I> by the ear. Layer III
addresses this problem specifically.

<P>
<A NAME="What is the hardware demand"><B>What is the hardware demand ?</B></A>
<P>
Layer III needs about 20MIPS per channel
for real-time coding. This means a real fast DSP. 
A full Layer-3 decoder is available from ITT (MAS 3503 C). The 
encoder is really more complex, if you need reference quality, but 
this means that you need e.g. 2 DSPs instead of one for Layer-2.
<P>
Layer II on the
other hand needs only a simple DSP like for example the AD2015 that
can be had for a few dollars. The process is asymmetrical, much more
processing is needed on the coding side. A decoder could be made to
work without hardware assistance on a decent computer.
<P>
HP already does full 
<A HREF="mpeggloss-f.html#frame rate">frame rate</A>
1.15 Mbps MPEG-1 decoding, 352x240x30 fps or 352x288x25 fps on its 712/80 
workstation.
That's currently video only; playing the audio causes 
<A HREF="mpeggloss-b.html#B-picture">B-frames</A>
to be skipped as necessary, but you still get better than 25 fps.
The quality is still far superior than Indeo et al even with
the 
<A HREF="mpeggloss-f.html#frame">frame</A>
skipping.  If you reduce the MPEG bit rate down so
that the quality is equivalent to say Indeo you can easily do
30 fps with sound, the cost of decoding MPEG depends on
the bit rate.
<BR>
Even though the player is software only, it relies on
special <I>halfword</I> instructions in the newer PA-RISC PCXL
chips, and on special frame buffer support for YUV data,
and <I>Color Recovery</I> which yields near 24 bit quality on
an 8 bit frame buffer.

Philips uses MPEG for their new <I>digital video</I> CD's. They say they
will start shipping movies and music videos on CD's for their <A HREF="mpeggloss-c.html#CD-I">CD-I</A>
player by the end of this year. MPEG is accepted by Eureka-147. That
means that when digital radio broadcasts starts in Europe a couple of
years from now, you will receive MPEG coded audio.

<A NAME="Which sampling frequencies are used"><B>Which sampling frequencies are used ?</B></A>
<P>
You can have 48kHz, (used in professional sound equipment), 44,1kHz
(used in consumer equipment like CD-audio) or 32kHz (used in some
communications equipment).

<P>
<A NAME="How many audio channels"><B>How many audio channels?</B></A>
<P>
MPEG I allows for two audio channels. These can be either single
(mono) dual (two mono channels), stereo or joint stereo (intensity
stereo or m/s-stereo). In normal (l/r) stereo one channel carries the
left audio signal and one channel carries the right audio signal. In
m/s stereo one channel carries the sum signal (l+r) and the other the
difference (l-r) signal. In intensity stereo the high frequency part
of the signal (above 2kHz) is combined. The stereo image is preserved
but only the temporal envelope is transmitted.
In addition MPEG allows for pre-emphasis, copyright marks and
original/copy marks. MPEG II allows for several channels in the same
stream.
