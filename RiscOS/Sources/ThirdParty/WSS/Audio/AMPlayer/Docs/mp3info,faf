 <li>MP3 Defined
 <li>Links to technical information
 <li>Why MP3?
</ul>
<hr>
<p>MPEG layer 3 is an audio format that produces highly compressed files while sacrificing very little audio quality - perceived frequency response and signal-to-noise ratio are retained. As a gross over-simplification, 
MP3 works by removing inaudible information. Compression ratios of up to 12:1 for stereo files can be achieved with very little degradation. If that bottom-line explanation isn't quite enough for you, visit the 
Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft - IIS site, where the <a href="http://www.iis.fhg.de/departs/amm/layer3/sw/index.html">MPEG Audio Layer 3 FAQ</a> resides. For a good write-up (in layman terms)
of the basics of audio perceptual coding, go <a href="http://www.fmhs.cnyric.org/music/mpegfact.html">here</a>. If that whetted your appetite, visit <a href="http://www.mpeg.org/~tristan/MPEG/audio.html">Tristan's MPEG Audio site</a>,
where every conceivable question you could have regarding MPEG layer 3 in specific, and MPEG in general, can be answered. 
<p>The compression ratio by itself makes the MP3 format ideal for Usenet posting, where disk space and transfer time are precious commodities. The smaller file size also means that posts will be less likely to be 
dropped: a 9-part file is more likely to come through whole than a 33-part file. As a side note, it is recommend posts be limited to 8250 lines (about 500k) as these files travel via usenet more reliably than the maximum 15000 lines
<p>An added bonus of MP3 is that it can be broken up into pieces, and each piece is still playable. Do you want 
to sample only the beginning of a multipart post? Download and uudecode only the first few parts. The 
feature that makes this possible (headerless file format) also means that MP3 files can be made to stream 
across the net real-time (assuming the playback bitrate and speed of the Internet connection are compatible). 
<p>The main disadvantage of layer 3 compression are that lots of processor power is required to encode and play files, a sound-card is required (16-bit sound card recommended for PCs), and the player/encoder/decoder 
software is not yet in widespread use. The last point is undergoing change as multimedia companies like 
<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/">Macromedia (Shockwave)</a>, <a href="http://www.audioactive.com/">Telos (Audioactive)</a>, and <a href="http://www.telematik.informatik.uni-karlsruhe.de/~walther/index.html">museArc</a> are incorporating layer 3 into their audio 
products. The sleeping giant, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/netshow/about.htm">Microsoft</a>, has recently awakened to the possibilities of streaming 
compression/decompression algorithms (codecs), including layer 3. Their ActiveX Streaming Format (ASF) 
is a codec-independent standard for delivering multimedia data over the Internet. The professional sound editing program <a href="http://www.sonicfoundry.com/">Sound Forge</a> has support for ASF, and special transport functions for dealing with MP3. The Microsoft Internet 
Information Server (works with the Windows NT server) and their NetShow player is how Microsoft plans 
to rule the audio/video multicast world (It's not the codec, stupid -- it's the delivery method!).

<p>In general, <a href="mp3.html#Our MP3 Sounds">the sounds we present here</a> were sampled in stereo at 22.05 kHz with 16-bit resolution. MPEG-2 layer 3 
encoding was used with a playback bitrate of 64 kbit/s resulting in 11:1 compression. I have purposely used MPEG-2 and avoided higher bitrates to keep CPU requirements down a bit. Even still, you need a fairly 
powerful computer to play these sounds realtime. There are currently realtime players available on PC's (MS-Windows and DOS), PowerMac (System 7.5.2 and 8), Sun Solaris, IRIX, Linux 2.0, FreeBSD and BeOS platforms.

<h4 align=center>Overview of encoders</h4>
<p><span CLASS=category><b>l3enc:</b></span> Most people will want to use l3encode because it is available for multiple platforms. This is the first software-only encoder, available from <a href="http://www.iis.fhg.de/departs/amm/layer3/">Fraunhofer's Institute.</a> The latest version of the encoder
(v2.72) was released on 12/10/97. There are encoders/decoders available for the DOS, UNIX, Linux(x86), and NeXTSTEP 3.3 platforms. The function of the encoder is to convert PCM (e.g. WAV) files into MP3 
files, and the function of the decoder is to convert MP3 files back into PCM files (a common misconception is that the decoder plays MP3 files). For more information on combined decoders and players see the
<a href="#How do I play the MP3 sounds archived here">above section</a>. If you are looking for older versions of the software try this <a href="ftp://ftp.tnt.uni-hannover.de/pub/MPEG/audio/other-servers/FhG-IIS-Mirror/">mirror</a>.
<p><span CLASS=category><b>ACM codecs:</b></span> The FraunhoferIIS ACM codecs (from the makers of l3enc) allow one to encode and play mp3 files from 
within any sound program - CoolEdit, Sound Forge or even Windows Sound Recorder. The 
codec is used to save .wav files in  MPEG layer-3 format (in fact it's just 
an .mp3 with a riff/wav header, you can change the extension to .mp3 and 
output the files with a MP3 player). The codec is 32-bit, operates <em>very</em> 
fast - three to five times that of l3enc - and is currently available in two 
versions:
<ol>
   <li><b>Advanced</b>, which supports MPEG-2 audio layer 3 from 16 to 56 kbit/s and the Fraunhofer MPEG-2.5 extension for 8kbit/s.
   <li><b>Professional</b>, which supports the above plus MPEG-1 audio layer 3 at data rates from 64 to 128 kbit/s.
</ol>
The codecs ship with MPEG Layer 3 producer available from <a href="http://www.opticom.de/">Opticom</a>. This application is rather expensive though -
the professional version is ~$350 USD. So what is a person to do? Ask Microsoft...<br>
The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/netshow/">Netshow2.0 player</a> comes with (among many 
others) the FhG-IIS Advanced MPEG Layer-3 codec. It is used as a cross-platform live or AOD (audio-on-demand) compression format. This means that 
anyone who installs the Netshow player (which comes with MSIE4.0) can encode layer3 .wav (or just plain .mp3) files. This codec is available from Microsoft for platforms other than windows<br>
<b>More information about cross-platform use coming soon</b>
<p><span CLASS=category><b>mpegEncoder:</b></span> This is a <b>freeware</b> mpeg encoder for Windows95/NT by soloh, based on the ISO source code. It can encode layer I, II and III files. Since it is currently in testing, some of the functions
don't work, but the encoding quality is very good and it can handle some slightly corrupted files better than l3enc. It supports batch conversion, runs with a GUI, can encode directly from CD's (maybe - see <a href="http://users.bart.nl/~soloh/mpegEnc.html">home page</a>) and the coding speed is greater than that of l3enc. The current version is <a href="http://users.bart.nl/~soloh/zips/mpegEnc_v006.zip">mpegEnc v0.06</a>.
<p><span CLASS=category><b>Mpeck (Mac):</b></span> Time was when Mac users couldn't encode/decode files on their boxes, at least not natively for 
less than about $400. Now you can encode for free with <a href="http://www.anime.net/~go/mpeckers.html">MPeck</a>, a PPC MacOS program designed to 
encode AIFF or PCM samples with a sampling frequency of 44100 Hz into stereo MPEG-1 layer 3 files 
with a bitrate of 128 kbps. If you want to pay, you can if you're a Shockwave devoloper -- you can use 
SoundEdit 16 or Director 5 to create streaming layer 3 SWA files using a Shockwave Xtra. A couple of 
notes on Shockwave layer 3 files, though. Dave Schmid has reported that MaPlay 1.81 won't play 
Macromedia files. Also, SoundApp seems to have problems playing these files. l3encoded files seem to 
work ok, though. Visit <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/director/how/shock/audio.html">Macromedia's Shockwave Audio Streaming and Compression</a> page for more 
information. Aaron Rosenblum keeps up a web site dedicated to <a href="http://www.rust.net/~rosenblu/mp3.html">MP3 on Macs</a>; he offers a step-by-step 
procedure for using Shockwave to create .mp3 files. Another way to create .mp3 files using a Mac is 
possible if you have access to another OS, such as a shell account on an ISP.
<p><span CLASS=category><b>Amiga:</b></span> There are no MPEG Audio Layer 3 coders for this platform.
<h4 align=center>Encoding Procedures</h4>
<p><span CLASS=category><b>l3enc:</b></span> Assuming you are using an unregistered version of l3enc, there are three encoding options you are allowed to use, they cover each of the operating modes of the program.

<p>I usually opt for MPEG-2 at a bitrate of 56 or 64 kbit/s (registration code required) for several reasons: first, 
having an AMD 486DX4-120, I can't play MPEG-1 files in stereo at full frequency -- my CPU is just not 
powerful enough. Second, I suspect there are many others out there like me who are not yet Pentium-ready, 
so from the standpoint of trying to introduce as many people as possible to the merits of MP3, using a less 
CPU-intensive mode makes sense. Lastly, I find MPEG2 to be of sufficient quality for my purposes. The 
difference between sounds sampled at 44.1 kHz and those sampled at 22.05 kHz is usually small enough that 
I can live with it -- even with music containing lots of cymbals. I don't find the extra bit of high-frequency 
response worth twice the file size. In DOS, the command line I use is:
<blockquote>
<samp>l3enc filename.wav filename.mp3 -br 56000 -crc -hq</samp>
</blockquote>
<p>In the above command line (assuming a 44.1 kHz-sampled, stereo file is being encoded), a 56 kbit/s, 22 kHz 
down-sampled, MPEG-2 file will be produced. I've found it's a good idea to use the -crc option to verify 
data integrity, especially when trying to produce streaming files. The -hq (high quality) switch encourages the 
encoder to try to produce higher audio quality at the cost of greatly reducing encoding speed (as much as 
three times slower, according to one source).
<p>Those of you with Pentiums who want CD quality will want to use MPEG-1 at 112 kbit/s or 128 kbit/s 
(registered users). The command line to produce a 112 kbit/s, MPEG-1 file (again assuming a 44.1 
kHz-sampled stereo input file) would be:
<blockquote>
<samp>l3enc filename.wav filename.mp3 -crc -hq</samp>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're encoding and run across a file that just dosen't sound good when coded at 112 or 128kbit/s (as some people have reported is the case for them), you can just code at a higher data rate to remove the compression artifacts. 192kbit/s is now supported by the software coder, and should eliminate any problems - if not then 256kbit/s will. Be prepared for large files though.
<p><span CLASS=category><b>mpegEncoder:</b></span> Information coming soon.
<h4 align=center>Decoding</h4>
<p>If you need a linear PCM file (WAV, AIF, SND or other) from your mp3's, it's easy to decode them with l3dec (which comes with l3enc above). This program is fully functional in the shareware release, all you need to do is enter the following at the command line and you'll have a huge file again - this will also give you maximum quality if your computer is too slow to provide high quality real-time playback.
<blockquote>
<samp>l3dec filename.mp3 filename.wav -wav</samp>
</blockquote>
<p>You will recieve a message that says "EOF !" when the program is finished decoding, along with the number of frames and the length - this is not an error, just the message indicating that the program is done.
<p>Some mp3 players, like maPlay and WinAMP can be set to output to a file instead of a sound device when playing. In this way they can be used to decode a mp3 to wav.
<h4 align=center>Streaming</h4>
<p>In order to send a <samp>.mp3</samp> file to be played in real-time you will need a way to let the player know where the file is. <samp>.m3u</samp> and <samp>.mp3url</samp> files were created for this purpose. <samp>.m3u</samp>'s are just like <samp>.ram</samp> files for RealAudio streaming. They are text files that contain the URL of one or more mp3 files. To make an <samp>.m3u</samp>, create a text file in any 
(preferably simple) text editor - like the ubiquitous Windows notepad (the universal tool for HTML editing, small Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> programs, batch files, Perl 
scripts and now m3u's). In this file put a URL such as:<br>
<samp>http://www.domain.com/~username/mp3files/mymp3file.mp3</samp><br>
(note this is not a working URL) and save it as <samp>mymp3file.m3u</samp> ... that's it, you now can stream the file over a network. Note: though most servers do not 
map the extension <samp>.mp3url</samp> to MIME:audio/x-mpegurl, it is the same as <samp>.m3u</samp>.

<tr><td><h2 CLASS=alt align=center><a name="FYI"><font color="white">For Your Info</font></a></h2>
<p align=center CLASS=update><font size=2 color="white">Last Updated: November 5, 1997</font>
<p><font color="white"><b>Does CPU affect sound quality of the realtime player?: </b>The answer appears to be yes. I have done a 
comparison between a mp3 file played on my 486 and the decoded-to-wav version of the same file. 
Compression artifacts present when played by Winplay3 v 2.0 released are not audible on the 
decoded-to-wav version. Audio enthusiast Arnold Kreuger has done some testing using higher-powered 
machines, and has linked degradation of the realtime player's audio quality to the exhaustion of its look-ahead 
buffer. He recommends using Pentium 133 or greater CPU's for optimum sound quality.</font>
<p><font color="white"><b>What sounds better: </b>stereo MPEG-1, 128kbit/s, played at half-frequency, or stereo MPEG-2, 64kbit/s, 
played at full frequency? My ears say that the former (128kbit/s) wins.</font>
<p><font color="white"><b>Bug fixed: encoding mono files:</b> With version 2.61, Fraunhofer-IIS has fixed a bug that resulted in mono 
files that were half as loud as they were supposed to be. Previously, to properly encode in mono, you had to 
start with a <em>stereo</em> input file and use the -dm (downmix) option.</font>
<p><font color="white"><b>About Problem Files:</b> Version 2.70 added 192kbit/s encoding rate which provides an alternative to encoding at 256kbit/s for files
that do not encode well at 112 or 128kbit/s. This rate has previously been available only in Fraunhofer's hardware encoders, one of the test streams on their site is at this data-rate.</font>
<p><font color="white"><b>Other encoding options with the non-registered version:</b> In general, the rules for the non-registered encoder seem to be:</font>
<ul>
<li><font color="white">Only bitrates of 16kbs (mono), 56kbs, or 112kbs are allowed.</font>
<li><font color="white">The '-dm' option is ignored. However, if you start with a mono file, you will end up with a mono file.</font>
<li><font color="white">Only sample rates of 44.1kHz, 22.05kHz, and 11.025kHz are allowed.</font>
</ul>
<p><font color="white"><b>Mono files at 56 kbit/s:</b> Fraunhofer recommends using MPEG-1 for encoding mono files with bitrates &gt;= 
48 kbit/s because of that format's higher bandwidth capability. Actually, 48 kbit/s encoding is not supported 
with the latest encoder: it's a relic from an earlier age. However, that aside, I have noticed encoding artifacts 
when I encode mono files in MPEG-1, even at 56 kbit/s. My recommendation would be that if you don't 
need the extra bandwidth (which is typical of many mono sources), use MPEG-2(.5) instead: this is done by 
using sample rates of 24kHz or less.</font>
<p><font color="white"><b>Performance of MPEG-2.5:</b> Fraunhofer-IIS introduced an extension to the MPEG-2 standard, dividing the 
low sample rates of MPEG-2 by 2, i.e. they introduced 8, 11.025, and 12 kHz - and named this extension 
"MPEG 2.5". According to Fraunhofer-IIS, "Layer-3" performs significantly better with 8 kbps @ 8 kHz or 
16 kbps @ 11 kHz than with 8 or 16 kbps @ 16. I tested this assertion on orchestral music (Theme from 
Raiders of the Lost Ark), and preferred the 16 kHz sample rate to the 11.025 sample rate because of its 
better high-frequency response. However, orchestral music is relatively easy to encode without introducing 
annoying artifacts. MPEG 2.5 sounded better than MPEG-2 on an old Abbott and Costello (speech only) 
clip with severely limited frequency response.</font>
<p><font color="white"><b>Speech Compression:</b> Version 2.70 added a speech flag to the command line which optimizes the layer 3 codec for speech,
however a real speech coder (like the Lucent Technologies <a href="http://www.elemedia.com/">Elemedia</a> SX8300P)
can provide high quality speech at 1.2 to 8.3kbit/s with realtime coding. This technology is used for Internet conferencing and digital cellular phones.
If you have Microsoft Netmeeting, this codec should be installed (see Audio codecs under Multimedia...advanced in control panel).</font>
<p><font color="white"><b>How does RealAudio 3.0 compare?</b> At 28.8 modem bitrates (15.2-16kbit/s mono, 20kbits/s stereo), <a href="http://www.realaudio.com/hpproducts/ra3.0/">RealAudio 3.0</a> (codec based on 
Dolby-Net technology) sounds quite similar to MPEG-2(.5) layer 3, at least to my ears. For an interesting 
press release featuring the major players on either side (Telos for layer 3 and Progressive Networks for 
RealAudio) debating the relative merits of their products, visit <a href="http://www.audioactive.com/">Telos's Audioactive site</a>, and read the news. 
<a href="http://ibm.rhrz.uni-bonn.de:80/~uzs083/homepage.html">Stefan Scheller, at his website</a>, has made an interesting comparison of the RealAudio 3.0, MPEG layers 2 
and 3, and Microsoft ADPCM formats. Layer 3 with the -hq option enabled is the clear winner among the 
codecs compared, according to Stefan.</font>
<p><font color="white"><b>How does Liquid Audio compare?</b> <a href="http://www.liquidaudio.com/">Liquid Audio</a> Seems to perform better than RealAudio. Its 
codec is similar (Dolby-Net), but better pre-filtering, perceptual models and production control allow higher performance. The company is tied tighly to Dolby Labs, and displays the Dolby Digital logo on the player.
From the size of the file I tried, it appears to stream at a 20kbit/s. I experienced no dropouts at that rate, and the music (pop music style) sounded great - the best audio quality I've ever heard streaming over a 28.8kbs modem connection
(yes, better than layer 3, -hq, streaming at 24kbit/s), others who have compared the performance of Layer3, Liquid Audio and RealAudio have responded with mixed results.</font>
<p><font color="white"><b>Problems with HTTP/1.1 server: </b>Stefan Scheller has reported the following: Winplay3 1.x cannot connect 
to a HTTP/1.1 server (e.g. Apache 1.2). The problem lies in the file SOCKLAY3.DLL. The program seems 
to check for the protocol string HTTP/1.0. The new protocols rejected. Perhaps there is someone who can 
change this?</font>
<p><font color="white"><b>CPU loading with various Sound Cards: </b>Hi-fi buff Arnold Kreuger has compared CPU usage with various 
sound cards. The following lists CPU use on a P5-133 machine while running Winplay3 v1.4</font>
