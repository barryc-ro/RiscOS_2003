things to look into:

1. Make frontend store autoQ state in a choices file

2. Make number of DCT elements publically readable

3. VBR?
   FIXED, but may click a little - why ?

4. Low bitrates don't work?
   seem ok when tried, don't have many

5. Decode directly to file

6. *AMArok

7. low bitrates played after high ones abort it seems
   FIXED

8. sample rate changed when frame is read rather than when it's played
   FIXED.

9. Locate by %
   Needed for VBR?

10. FileInfo affects current track when file for info has ID3v2 tag present.

11. Streaming interface.

12. 'Remembered' ID3v2 tags for frontend - another module, maybe ?
