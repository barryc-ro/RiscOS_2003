Fixed bug - fileinfo consitst of a series of file entry items, not just
one as previously assumed. C++ often results in more than one, leaving
MeMCheck unable to give C++ source info.

As a result, DDT_CopySectionFilename now gets the module name (in the
section item), rather then the filename of the first fileentry.


Added DDT_Throwback()
