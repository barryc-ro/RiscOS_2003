/* 
 * Title:  drawfdiag.h
 * Purpose: Processing of Draw format files (diagram level interface)
 *
 */

/*
 *
 * This file defines the interface to the simplest version of the
 * DrawFile module. It can read in files to diagrams and render them.
 * There is no checking of whether we have overrun the end of the
 * diagram.
 *
 * To read in Draw files, it is expected that the caller will do the
 * work of the I/O themselves.
 *
 * To dispose of a diagram, the caller can just throw it away, ie,
 * the module does not keep any hidden information about what
 * diagrams it has seen.
 *
 * Note on returning errors: some calls return an offset to the bad data on
 * an error. This is not necessarily the start of an object: it may be bad
 * data part way through it. The offset is relative to the start of the
 * diagram.
 *
 * The module cannot handle rectangle or ellipse objects. Use a path instead.

 * Description:   Verifies a diagram which has been read in from file
 *
 * Parameters:    draw_diag *diag -- the diagram to be verified
 *                draw_error *error -- the first error encountered (if any)
 * Returns:       True if diagram is correct.

 *                draw_diag *diag2 -- diagram to be appended to diag1
 *                draw_error *error -- possible error condition.
 * Returns:       True if merge was successful.
 * Other Info:    Both diagrams should have been processed by

 * Description:   Render a diagram with a given scale factor, in a given

 *
 * Parameters:    draw_diag *diag -- the diagram to be rendered
 *                draw_redrawstr *r -- the WIMP redraw rectangle

/* ---------------------- draw_registerMemoryFunctions ---------------------
 * Description:   Register three functions to be used to allocate, extend
 *                and free memory, when rendering text objects
 *
 * Parameters:    draw_allocate alloc -- pointer to function to be used for
 *                                       memory allocation
 *                draw_extend extend  -- pointer to function to be used for
 *                                       memory extension
 *                draw_free   free    -- pointer to function to be used for
 *                                       memory freeing.
 * Returns:       void.
 * Other Info:    These three functions will be used only when rendering text
 *                area objects. Any memory allocated during rendering will
 *                be freed (using the supplied function) after rendering.  
 *                If draw_registerMemoryFunctions() is never called,
 *                or if memory allocation fails, then an attempt to render
 *                a text area will produce no effect.
 *                The three functions should operate as follows:
 *                  int alloc(void **anchor, int n) : 
 *                          allocate n bytes of store and set *anchor
 *                          to point to them.
 *                          Return 0 if store can't be allocated, otherwise
 *                          non-zero.
 *                  int extend (void **anchor, int n):
 *                          extend the block of memory which starts at 
 *                          *anchor to a total size of n bytes. Note that
 *                          n will always be positive, and the new memory
 *                          should be appended to the existing block (which
 *                          may be moved by the operation).
 *                          Return 0 if the memory can't be allocated, else
 *                          non-zero.
 *                  void free(void **anchor):
 *                          free the block of memory which starts at
 *                          *anchor, and set *anchor to 0.
 *
 *                **NOTE** : The specification for these three functions is
 *                           the same as that for flex_alloc, flex_extend
 *                           and flex_free (in the flex module), so these
 *                           can be used as the three required functions!!

/************************ Unknown object handling **************************/

 * The handler is called whenever an attempt is made to render an object 
 * whose tag is not one of the standard ones known to DrawFile. It is passed
 * a pointer to the object to be rendered (cast to a void *), and a pointer
 * to a block into which to write any error status. The object pointer may
 * be cast to one of the standard Draw types (defined in the object level
 * interface), or to a client-defined type. If an error occurs, the handler
 * must return FALSE and set up the error block; otherwise it must return
 * TRUE. Unknown objects must conform to the standard convention for object
 * headers, i.e. 1-word object tag; 1-word object size; 4-word bounding box.
 * The unknown object handler is only called if the object is visible, i.e.
 * if there is an overlap between its bounding box and the region of the
 * diagram being rendered. The object size field must be correct, otherwise
 * catastrophes will probably result.
