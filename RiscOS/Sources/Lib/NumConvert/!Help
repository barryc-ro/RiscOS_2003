Before checking in anything:

- Run !MkClean
- Remove dynamic dependencies from Makefile

Checking in:

- Commit it all, giving a suitable change log, e.g.:
  cvs commit -F ~/log NumConvert
- Tag the whole lot with the component and version number, e.g.:
  cvs tag -R mrison_numconvert-x_xx NumConvert
- If you really need to make a change to an already checked-in
  version without incrementing the version number, you'll need to
  untag and retag
