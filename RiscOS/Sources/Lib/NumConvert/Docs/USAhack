EXTENSIONS TO DAYTONA TO SUPPORT ALL THE QUIRKS OF THE NANP
===========================================================

Overview
--------

There are at least two significant problems with the North American
Numbering Plan.

1) Sometimes, even though one is in the same area code, the
area code must be dialled.  Normally, when one is in the same
area code one need only dial the subscriber number (the last
seven digits of the number, in the USA).

Example: (617) 222-2222 wishes to ring (617) 222-3333.  To
do this, they only need to dial "2223333".  But if they wish
to ring (617) 333-3333, it turns out they need to dial
"6173333333" or "16173333333" (it is not known at the time of
writing whether both of these forms are always valid);
"3333333" is not sufficient.

2) Sometimes, even though one is in a different area code, the
national access prefix need not be dialled (typically if an
area code has split up but the area codes are considered to be
local for billing purposes).  Normally, when one is in a
different area code one needs to dial the national access
prefix (1, in the USA) prior to the area code and subscriber
number.

Example: (617) 222-2222 wishes to ring (505) 444-4444.  To
do this, they need to dial "15054444444".  But if they wish
to ring (503) 666-6666, it turns out they only need to
dial "5036666666"; "15036666666" is not necessary (it is not
known at the time of writing whether the latter form would
cause national call rates rather than local call rates to
be charged).

Conventions
-----------

Currently Daytona stores all its numbers internally in two
formats:

- "+<number>" for full international form, e.g. "+441223725358"
for (01223) 725358, a number in Cambridge, UK.

- "-<number>" for a number on a PBX, e.g. "-5358" for extension
5358 on the PBX Daytona is connected to.

Daytona now needs to support three additional conventions.
All conventions behave exactly like the "+<number>" convention
if the configured country code is not 1 (USA).

- "a<number>" for a full international form, additionally indicating
that the number must be dialled with the national access code and
area code even if one is in the same area code.

- "b<number>" for a full international form, additionally indicating
that the number must be dialled with the area code even if one is in
the same area code.

- "c<number>" for a full international form, additionally indicating
that the number must be dialled with the national access code even
if one is in the same area code (it is not known at the time of
writing whether this is actually needed).

Examples:

Say Daytona is configured for country code 1 (USA), area code 617
and subscriber number 222-2222.

"+16173333333" would be dialled as "3333333".
"a16173333333" would be dialled as "16173333333".
"b16173333333" would be dialled as "6173333333".
"c16173333333" would be dialled as "13333333".

"+14443333333" would be dialled as "14443333333".
"a14443333333" would be dialled as "14443333333".
"b14443333333" would be dialled as "4443333333".
"c14443333333" would be dialled as "13333333".

"+441223725358" would be dialled as "011441223725258".
"a441223725358" would be dialled as "011441223725258".
"b441223725358" would be dialled as "011441223725258".
"c441223725358" would be dialled as "011441223725258".

(Note: do not confuse the 1 in "+1", which is the country code
for the USA with the 1 in the dialled numbers, which is the
national access code within the USA.)

Automatic convention selection
------------------------------

The following algorithm is only used if the configured country
code is 1 (USA).

When captured from the local fax machine or when typed in as
a one-shot fax number:

- If the number, after stripping any leading outside line prefix,
has 11 digits and starts with "1" (the USA national access code),
and the next digits are the configured area code, convention
"a" is assumed.

- If the number, after stripping any leading outside line prefix,
has 10 digits, convention "b" is assumed.

- If the number, after stripping any leading outside line prefix,
has 8 digits and starts with "1" (the USA national access code),
convention "c" is assumed.

- Otherwise the normal "+" convention is assumed.

TBD: What about extensions, bongtones and other wotsits?

Address-book exchange
---------------------

Address-book exchanged details are not altered.  That is, only
the "+" convention is used for fax numbers exchanged.  This is
because it is impossible for the machine sending the details
to know what convention might be required when the machine
receiving the details wishes to ring it back.

[This is perhaps not true: the address-book exchange could
have an additional field saying what convention was used.
On the assumption of reciprocity, the same convention could
be assumed by the receiver of the details.]

[[Tasteful or what?]]

[[[Yes, yes, this is lovely!]]]

When the receiver searches its address book for a match,
it first searches by serial number.  If this fails (presumably
because the details were entered manually) it replaces the
leading "+" of the received number with the convention letter,
and searches for that.  In this way the record can be found.

Example:

John SMITH, whose country code is 1 whose area code is 617,
and whose subscriber number is 555-5555 manually enters an
address-book record for Joe BLOGGS on 1 (617) 444-4444.  This
ends up as "a16174444444" internally.

John SMITH is then called by Joe BLOGGS.  Both have Daytonas.
Joe BLOGGS needed to dial 16175555555 to get John SMITH.
Joe BLOGGS' details exchange specifies convention "a" was
needed.  John SMITH's Daytona searches its address book for
Joe BLOGGS' machine's serial number, and fails.  It now
searches for Joe BLOGGS' machine's fax number, exchanged
as "+16174444444", but replaces the "+" with the specified
convention, "a".  Bingo!

Notes
-----

This scheme obviates the need for the address book to have
tick boxes for "always dial national access code" and/or
"always dial area code".

This scheme will go a bit wrong if an area code splits up,
but staying local, because the convention in the address
book will have the wrong convention.

Example: (617) splits to (617) and (555).  The user had
subscriber ID 4444444 in their address book (i.e.
(617) 4444444).  This appears as 4444444 in their address
book.  User has to go in and retype as 5554444444 to
make things work.

Example: (617) becomes not-all-numbers-are-local.  The
user had subscriber ID 4444444 in their address book (i.e.
(617) 4444444).  This appears as 4444444 in their address
book.  User has to go in and retype as 6174444444 or
16174444444 to make things work.

Implications of change
----------------------

The number conversions will have to be severely overhauled.
They will have to be carefully tested, especially with
respect to mixing of USA-configured and non-USA-configured
boxes.

!Daytona and !DayAdd will have to be modified a bit, e.g.:

- !Daytona must add the convention used to details exchange,
where appropriate.

- !DayAdd might have to change its search strategy a bit
(or !Daytona should pass the fax number already conventionified).
