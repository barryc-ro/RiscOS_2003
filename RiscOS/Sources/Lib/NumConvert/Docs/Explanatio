A phone number is uniquely identified by three components:

- The country code.

- The area code.

- The local code.

The country code is a one to three-digit number.  For example,
the country code for the UK is 44 and the country code for the
USA is 1.

The area code subdivides the country into areas.  For example,
the area code for Cambridge in the UK is 1223.  In the USA,
the area code is the first three digits of the 10-digit form
of the number.

The local code identifies the phone within the area code.  For
example the Acorn switchboard's local code is 725000.  In the
USA, the local code is the last seven digits of the 10-digit
form of the number.

If one wants to dial someone in the same area one just dials
the local code.  For example, dialling the Acorn switchboard
from a phone in Cambridge one need only dial 725000.  Similarly
dialling 123-456-7890 from 123-223-4567 in the USA, one need
only dial 4567890.

If one wants to dial someone in the same country, but a different
area code, one needs to dial the national access prefix, followed
by the callee's area code, followed by the callee's local code.
For example, the national access prefix is 0 in the UK and
1 in the USA, and so, for example, dialling the Acorn switchboard
from London one dials 0-1223-725000.  Similarly, dialling
123-456-7890 from 456-223-4567 in the USA, one dials 1-123-4567890.

If one wants to dial someone in another country, one needs to dial
the international access prefix, followed by the callee's country
code, area code and local code.  For example, the international
access prefix is 00 in the UK and 001 in the USA, and so, for
example, dialling the Acorn switchboard from the USA one dials
001-44-1223-725000.  Similarly, dialling 123-456-7890 in the USA
from the UK, one dials 00-1-123-4567890.

Note it is traditional to specify an international number
replacing the international access prefix by a plus sign, because
this prefix varies from country to country.  So, for example,
the Acorn switchboard could be given as +44 1223 725000, and
123-456-7890 in the USA could be given as +1 123 4567890.

There are an additional couple complications.  First, if one is
on a private branch exchange (PBX) one normally has to dial an
outside line prefix to get an outside line, otherwise the number
is assumed to be an extension on the PBX.  The outside line prefix
is typically 9 or 0.  To dial 123-456-7890 in the USA from Acorn,
for example, one dials 9-00-1-123-4567890.  Second, one sometimes
has to wait a bit, or wait for dialtone, after dialling the outside
line prefix and/or the international access code.  In the worst
case, therefore, dialling 123-456-7890 in the USA might involve
dialling 9-wait for dialtone-00-wait a bit-1-123-4567890.

Daytona allows the user to type in a number in any of the forms
described above, assuming the box has been suitably configured.
If, for example, the country code has been specified as 1 and
the area code as 123 (for a user whose phone number is 123-4567890
in the USA), then the user could type in, for example:

- 2234567 (or 1-123-2234567 (note the first one is the *national access
prefix*) or even 001-1-123-2234567 (note the first one is for the
international access code and the second one is for the *country code*)!)
for 123-2234567 in the USA (same area).

- 456-2234567 (or even 001-1-456-2234567) for 456-2234567 in the USA
(different area).

- 001-44-1223-725000 (or +44 1223 725000) for (01223) 725000 in the UK
(the Acorn switchboard).

Similarly a user configured for country code 44 and area code 1223
(Cambridge, UK) could type in, for example:

- 234567 (or (01223) 234567 or even 0044 1223 234567!) for (01223)
234567 in the UK (same area).

- (0181) 833-2181 (or even 00 44 181 8332181) for (0181) 8332181
in the UK (different area).

- +1 123-4567890 for 123-4567890 in the USA.

Note the input routine allows spaces, parentheses and hyphens to
be entered for the user's aesthetic comfort, but these are ignored.
Any non-leading plus signs are ignored too.  Also note no outside
line prefix should be entered; Daytona adds this in automatically
when dialling out, if appropriate.

Additionally (!) numbers on the same PBX (if appropriate) can be
specified by a leading x; this prevents Daytona from using an
outside line prefix (if appropriate).  So 725258 could dial 725237
by entering x5237.

When Daytona displays a number, it displays the shortest form
it can (local, else national, else international).  Extension numbers
are shown with a leading x.  No outside line prefix is shown.
