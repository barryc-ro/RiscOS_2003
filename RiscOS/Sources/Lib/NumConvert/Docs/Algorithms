Conversion from fax-captured number to international/internal format
====================================================================

Inputs:

- The number, as captured (contains DTMF digits and commas only).

- Whether the number might start with an outside line prefix and
if so, what it is.

- What the international and area prefixes are.

- What the country and area codes are.

Outputs:

- The international number (contains DTMF digits only) with an implicit
leading plus, or the internal number.  @@ Indicate which?

Algorithm:

- Ignore commas (since they just indicate pauses).  @@ not store?

- If there exists an outside line prefix, but the number doesn't
start with it, it must be an internal number; return it.

- Otherwise if there exists an outside line prefix, and the number does
start with it, it must be an external number; strip the prefix.

- Then if the number starts with the international prefix, strip it,
and return rest of string.

- Otherwise if the number starts with the area prefix, strip it,
and return rest of string with the country code prepended.

- Otherwise the number must be a local number; return it with the
country code and area code prepended.


Conversion from address-book-entered number to international format
===================================================================

Note that this should not be used for internal numbers: these are
not converted to internal format.

Inputs:

- The number, as entered (should contain only DTMF digits and spaces,
and optionally a leading plus; it should not contain an outside line
prefix).

- What the international and area prefixes are.

Outputs:

- The international number (contains DTMF digits only) with an implicit
leading plus.

Algorithm:

- Ignore spaces and any non-leading pluses.

- If the number starts with a plus or the international prefix,
strip it, and return rest of string.

- Otherwise if the number starts with the area prefix, strip it,
and return rest of string with the country code prepended.

- Otherwise the number must be a local number; return it with the
country code and area code prepended.


Conversion from international format to user-friendly number
============================================================

Note that this should not be used for internal numbers: these are
suitable for immediate display.

Inputs:

- The international-format number (should contain only DTMF digits;
with an implicit leading plus).

- What the international and area prefixes are.

- What the country and area codes are.

Outputs:

- A number suitable for display (contains only DTMF digits and spaces).

Algorithm:

- If the input number doesn't start with the country code, concatenate
the international prefix and the number itself, and return that.

- Otherwise strip the country code from the input number.

- Then if the number doesn't start with the area code, concatenate the
area prefix and the input number, and return that.

- Otherwise strip the area code from the input number, and return that.


Conversion from international format to dial string
===================================================

Note that this should not be used for internal numbers: these are
suitable for appending straight after ATDT.

Inputs:

- The international-format number (should contain only DTMF digits;
with an implicit leading plus).

- Whether the number should start with an outside line prefix and
if so, what it is.

- What the international and area prefixes are.

- What the country and area codes are.

- Whether to pause or wait for dial tone after outside line
prefix, and ditto after international prefix.

Outputs:

- A dial string suitable for appending to ATDT (contains only DTMF
digits, commas and Ws).

Algorithm:

- Initialise the dial string with the outside line prefix if required,
followed by any pause/wait.

- If the number doesn't start with the country code, append the
international prefix, any pause/dialtone wait (',' and 'W' respectively),
and the number itself, and return that.

- Otherwise strip the country code from the number.

- Then if the number doesn't start with the area code, append the
area prefix and the number to the dial string, and return that.

- Otherwise strip the area code from the number.

- Then append the number to the dial string, and return that.
