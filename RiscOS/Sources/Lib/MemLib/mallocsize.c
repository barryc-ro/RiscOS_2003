  malloc_usable_size:

    This routine tells you how many bytes you can actually use in an
    allocated chunk, which may be more than you requested (although
    often not). You can use this many bytes without worrying about
    overwriting other allocated objects. Not a particularly great
    programming practice, but still sometimes useful.
