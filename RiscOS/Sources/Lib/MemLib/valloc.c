/*

  memalign algorithm:

    memalign requests more than enough space from malloc, finds a spot
    within that chunk that meets the alignment request, and then
    possibly frees the leading and trailing space.

    The alignment argument must be a power of two. This property is not
    checked by memalign, so misuse may result in random runtime errors.

    8-byte alignment is guaranteed by normal malloc calls, so don't
    bother calling memalign with an argument of 8 or less.

    Overreliance on memalign is a sure way to fragment space.
