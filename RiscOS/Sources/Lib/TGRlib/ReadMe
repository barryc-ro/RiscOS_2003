When releasing a new version of commonlib, two libraries must be created:
one suitable for inclusion in normal application code, and the other suitable
to be included in module code.

To do this:

  Make sure the o directory is empty.

  Double-click on Makefile to build commonlib.

  *** Delete the object files from o again ***

  Double-click on Makefilem to build commonlibm.

Both these libraries should be copied to the appropriate place on Releases
when a new library is released.
