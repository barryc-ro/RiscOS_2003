Common Library History
----------------------

  0.00   TGR   Incomplete version
  0.01   TGR   Initial working version
  0.02   TGR   Documentation changed to include full prototypes of functions,
                  to include details of all symbols used and to clarify
                  behaviour when giving NULL pointers or zero integers to
                  functions.
               Bug fixes including repair of varargs behaviour in
                  debug_output, etc.
  0.03   MFC   Clarification of documentation and some bug-fixes.
               Simplified msgs_lookup(..).
               msgs_make_error(..) now allows argument substitution.
               New function msgs_make_error(..) for ED macro.
               Error return macros moved to msgs.h.
  0.04   TGR   Allow string for error now "E"; for dbmalloc now "M"
               dbmalloc: "#define checkheap()" for non-debugging
                is now dbmalloc_chkheap, as it should be.
               dbmalloc: checkheap now outputs a newline at the end of the
                function (for legibility)
  0.05   MFC   debug_ouput(..): va_start(..) and va_end(..) calls now bracket
                each vararg use.
  0.06   MFC   Added 'ReadMe' file to explain the need to make two versions
                of the library: one for inclusion in application code, and
                the other for module code.
  0.07   MFC   vfprintf (stdout, ...) replaced by vprintf (...) so that the
                library can be successfully linked with TinyStubs.
               Separate make files for the application code version and for
                the module code version are now in place.
  0.08   MFC   msgs.h now includes the constant PROG_ERR.
  0.09   TGR   Debug outputted newline removed at end of checkheap.
  0.10   TGR   MessagesFD now MsgsFD to avoid conflict with toolbox.h
