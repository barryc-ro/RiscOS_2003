   OVERVIEW
   ========
   Class definition for a ServerAccount object.  Object is an abstract
   base class from which the concrete classes POP3Account, IMAPAccount
   and LocalAccount are derived.  This class defines the general Account
   object interface.  Apart from the initial creation of the concrete
   object, the client need not know what actual object type it is using
   as all operation are through this class's interface.

   The class interface defines the following methods: Connect, Disconnect,
   GetINBOX and GetMailboxes.

   Connect requests that the connection to the Account's mailbox be
   established.  The object holds the required configuration details for
   this that are given when the concrete instance of the object was
   created.  Like most methods, it is asyncronous, as input a callback
   function object is given which holds a pointer to a function to call
   once the operation is complete or reached some milestone.  The
   function is only called back provided the Connect method has not
   returned an error.  This operation is true for all methods that work
   in the asyncronous manner.  See the ELib_cbf class definition for
   details on that object.

   Disconnect method causes the connection to the account to be brought
   down if it is not already.  If another operation is in progress, then
   in most cases that operation is aborted, however, this may not always
   be possible.

   GetINBOX method returns a reference to the Account's INBOX which holds
   incoming mail.  All accounts have at least this mailbox.

   GetMailboxes returns a reference to the list of the Accounts mailboxes.
   This includes the INBOX which is always the first in the list and any
   other mailboxes
