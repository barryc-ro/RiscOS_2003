	Header file for the Post Email library

	HISTORY
	=======
	21/07/97	0.01	RDW	initial version
	24/07/97	0.02	RDW	corrected overview and dates.  Added INVALIDCONTEXT, NOTENOUGHTIME to ELib_rcode
	xx/08/97	0.03	RDW	commented out the signed int typedefs as cfront can't do signed.  Replaced with
					implicit signed types
	10/10/97	0.04	RDW	#define and #ifndef check put round bool type definition
	19/01/98	0.05	RDW	ELIB_ENOTVALIDENTITY added to ELib_rcode
	21/01/98	0.06	RDW	ELIB_EINVALIDMULTIPART and ELIB_ENOTVALIDENTITY added to ELib_rcode
	31/08/98	0.07	RDW	bool replaced with include from Email/Common/bool.h
					int types replaced with include from Email/Common/types.h
					ELib_rcode removed - to be replaced with ELib_rcode from Email/Common/types.h
	30/09/98	0.08	RDW	ELIB_TE_NONE value is 0, ELIB_TE_7BIT is now 1.  ELIB_TE_NONE means OS data format
					ie. no encoding performed/determined for it. ELIB_TE_7BIT is 7BIT!
	13/10/98	0.09	RDW	ELIB_TE_TEXT_QUOTING ELIB_TE added
	29/10/98	0.10	RDW	ELIB_CT_MESSAGE_TYPE enum added for MIMEmessage
