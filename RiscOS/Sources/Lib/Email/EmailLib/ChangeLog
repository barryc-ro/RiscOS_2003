===============================================================================
Version:	0.47
Date:		1998-10-06
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_EmailLib-0_47

Integrated Quoted-printable support in body parts.
Added ReplaceBody() method to MIMEentity so that the Content-Transfer-Encoding
header is updated if the body is changed.

Fixed major fault in elibbase write_to_file method - it wasn't closing the
source file by calling stop() when it finished writing out.

-zps1 removed from c & c++ flags for module build to allow use in module
wrapped applications.

Simple GetCharSet methods added to entities

Fixed fault in date header parsing of 2 digit years - they had 1900 subtracted
from them like 4 digit years for inserting into the struct tm as the struct
counts the year from 1900 onwards.  2 digit years now no longer have 1900
subtracted from them!

2 digit years before 70 are taken to be years 2000 to 2069, 70 and after are
1970 - 1999. This is so that if old email software creating 2 digit years in
date fields is still in use in the next century, EmailLib will interpret the
year correctly.  If they and EmailLib based software are still in use by 2070
I'll be very surprised....I'll also be 96!

===============================================================================
Version:	0.46
Date:		1998-10-02
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_EmailLib-0_46

Changed ELIB_TE enum (encoding enum) so that 7BIT and NONE are different.
NONE is text is host OS system text format, 7BIT is RFC 7BIT format.

Added support for CC header in header class which got missed in 0.45.

headers class merging of headers between entitys changed so that the new
headers are appended to the current list.  ie. merging a MIMEentity into a
rfc822msg entity, the headers from the MIMEentity are now correctly appended
to the rfc822msg entity's headers and not put at the start.

Creation of base class address header and WriteOut (from class) fixed - changes
in 0.45 broken creation and writing out of address headers.

body class Display() method modified to take note of the difference between
7BIT and NONE encoding

Library version now put in MIME-Version header field body comment

===============================================================================
Version:	0.45
Date:		1998-10-01
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_EmailLib-0_45

Multiple address support added to source and destination headers with the
creation of a new class "mailbox" to model the mailbox token in RFC822.  Not
100% compliant yet as group names are not supported.  Base source/destination
header class "from" modified to use mailboxes.

CC header added.

Moved ApplyEncoding/RemoveEncoding implemenation from MIMEentity into entity
class.

8BIT decode support added.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.44
Date:		1998-08-28
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_EmailLib-0_44

Major type name changes to remove NetFax specifics from library.  All NFE
prefixes are changed to ELIB.

BOOL, TRUE and FALSE changed to correct c++ bool, true and false.

Shared/Common Email library types moved to a new library in:
RiscOS/Sources/Lib/EMail/Common

EmailLib is now dependant on this new library.

This version of EmailLib does not work with any current version of NFELib
(NetFax Email library - version at this time is 0.49).  NFELib needs to be
modified to use ELIB type names internally in it's calls to EmailLib.  The
last of the NFE code in EmailLib, the X-NetFax header types, will be moved
to NFELib once NFELib is updated and the EmailLib development branch changes
are merged in to EmailLib on the TRUNK.

Current NFELib can continue to use the EmailLib on that's on the Daytona
branch with it.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.43
Date:		1998-05-27
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_EmailLib-0_43

C++FLAGS changed in Makefile to remove function names from the object code.
Saves a bit of code space.

===============================================================================
Version:	0.42
Date:		1998-05-14
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_EmailLib-0_42

Fixed Content-Type headers with no parameters from failing to parse correctly
 - PAN-01174.

===============================================================================
Version:	0.41
Date:		1998-04-17
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_EmailLib-0_41
