===============================================================================
Version:	0.54
Date:		1998-12-03
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_EmailLib-0_54

RealNamePresent method added to mailbox class.  Returns true if mailbox
has a real name part.  What a surprise!


===============================================================================
Version:	0.53
Date:		1998-12-01
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_EmailLib-0_53

MIME entities without a Content-Type header are now correctly handled as
MIMEtext (text/plain) objects.

Unrecognised MIME sub-types are now correctly handled as MIMEentity
(application/octet-stream) objects.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.52
Date:		1998-11-06
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_EmailLib-0_52

Fixes made to bodyrfc822 class so that the message it holds is written out
as is without the email library reformating it (as per. RFC2046 specification).

rfc822msg class split into 2 classes now.  New rfc822 base class created
from what was the original rfc822msg class.  New rfc822msg class is derived
from rfc822 class.  rfc822msg class continues to work as before, however, most
of the implementation is in the parent class (rfc822).

rfc822msg class implements RFC822 message and RFC822 message with MIME
support, creation and parsing.
rfc822 class implements the body part of the MIME type message/rfc822.
MIMEmessage and bodyrfc822 class updated from EmailLib 0.51 to correctly use
rfc822 class objects now.

Fixed memory leak in mimevers class constructor that was introduced in
EmailLib 0.51.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.51
Date:		1998-11-04
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_EmailLib-0_51

Version singleton, EmailLibVersion, implemented.  Requires Email/Common library
version 0.07 or later.

First implementation of message/rfc822 support added.

Quoted printable encoding fixed - it wasn't being passed the current encoding
of the object, so was assuming the data had no encoding (ELIB_TE_NONE) - ie.
OS format.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.50
Date:		1998-10-19
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_EmailLib-0_50

Actual MemCheck and HeirProf targets added now - it doesn't use the debug
target any more.  Therfore, you don't have to do a clean and swap between
builds.
    <export$dir>.Lib.Email.EmailLib.o.EmailLibMC is MemCheck build
    <export$dir>.Lib.Email.EmailLib.o.EmailLibHP is HierProf build    
  HierProf build is just a normal build, but with function names embedded.

mailbox parsing fixed so that local (ie. addresses with no domain) email
addresses are parsed correctly.  mailbox GetData (used by GetAddress and
GetRealName) fixed for version when mailbox object is requested to allocate
the memory for the Get.  The output parameter, wasn't!  It's now correctly a
reference to a char* in GetData().  GetAddress and GetRealName were already
correct.

rfc822msg::CreateReply extended to take an optional parameter: exclude_address
which is an email address to exclude from the reply address.  eg. to allow
creation of a reply-to-all but the recipient of the original message.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.49
Date:		1998-10-19
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_EmailLib-0_49

New features
------------
Create reply functionality added - see rfc822msg class, you can for a
rfc822msg object create a new skeleton rfc822msg object with the To and
subject headers setup for you and the first text entity quoted ">" with
the .sig removed.  Reply and reply to all is supported

from header class changed to support the create reply functionality so that
to headers can be created from a from or reply-to header object of any type
(memory or file) and subsequently have mailbox objects added to and removed.

BFS (Breadth First Search) algorithm added to bodymulti/MIMEmultip classes for
searching for the 1st text entity in a message at the highest level for use in
replying.

Bug fixes
---------
WriteOut() to memory version fixed on all classes so that the 'walk' down
all the objects on WriteOut() appends to the memory and doesn't keep
writing from the start as it used to.  Some possible faults still remain
in here though.

Fixed memory leak in rfc822msg objects of the mime_obj in a message not being
destroyed.

Fixed WriteOut on MIMEentity so that a WriteOut doesn't permanently change the
stored Content-Transfer-Encoding of a MIMEentity due to the WriteOut which may
need to encode the object for the WriteOut operation.

Tests
-----
Changes tested with EmailLib test harnesses and in !NCMail.  Test harnesses
all pass, however !NCMail exhibits a malloc heap corruption problem.
Probably EmailLib fault, but not proven yet.

Misc
----
See !ChangeLog, .h and .c++ files for full details of the changes.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.48
Date:		1998-10-12
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_EmailLib-0_48

New Features
------------
All classes: WriteOut() method (file version only for now) - Automatic
encoding on WriteOut implemented.  This greating simplifies the work for the
client of EmailLib, especially when forwarding messages or creating messages
of complex structure.

WriteOut method can now take a ELIB_TE to indicate the data stream format.
All objects implement this method and encode themselves, as appropriate
(automatically) into the destination file in a format suitable for tranmitting
that file over a data stream of the given format.  The following ELIB_TE
values are valid:

ELIB_TE_NONE	WriteOut in current encoding format (same as original
		implemented of WriteOut() method
ELIB_TE_7BIT	WriteOut encoded in format suitable for sending over 7bit
		data stream (ie. SMTP)
ELIB_TE_8BIT	WriteOut encoded in format suitable for sending over 8bit
		data stream (ie. ESMTP with 8BITMIME support)
ELIB_TE_BINARY	WriteOut in pure binary format, no encodings at all
		(not implemented as yet)

rfc822msg::GetRecipients() method added.  For a rfc822msg object, returns
a comma separated list suitable for use with Mailbox library SendQMailbox
objects or RModule AcornSMTP.  The list is the list of email addresses for
all the recipients of this message.  ie. all the to, cc, etc. addresses.

expired() function now takes parameter value of 0 to indicate that operation
time slice should never expire.  ie. run operation to termination - successful
or failure.

All classes: GetWriteOutEncoding() added to support the new WriteOut() method
aboe.  Takes a data stream format and returns the transfer encoding that
object will apply to itself if it is told to WriteOut() with that data stream
format.  Allows the Content-Transfer-Encoding header object to be correctly
set/created before the MIMEentity body is written out.

headers::Prepend() method added to support new WriteOut() method.  Same as
operator+=, except the headers are added at the start of the list instead of
the end.

body::Apply&RemoveEncoding methods renamed to PerformApplyEncoding() and
PerformRemoveEncoding().  new Apply&RemoveEncoding methods implemented which
call the Perform... methods as required and replace the body memory area/file
as before.  The Perform... methods perform the encoding without changing the
object.  These are used by the new WriteOut method implement in the body class.

Bug Fixes
---------
* Fixed to & cc header constructors which weren't setting the their header
  type.
* MIMEentity GetContentTransferEncoding methods - tidied up code duplication.
  It's more effience now.
* from class support of legacy SetAddress(), SetRealName() methods, mailbox
  object not constructed in from constructor anymore.  Now constructed and
  added to list when required by SetAddress() or SetRealName()

Tests
-----
Changes tested with EmailLib test harnesses and in !NCMail.

Misc
----
See !ChangeLog, .h and .c++ files for full details of the changes.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.47
Date:		1998-10-06
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_EmailLib-0_47

Integrated Quoted-printable support in body parts.
Added ReplaceBody() method to MIMEentity so that the Content-Transfer-Encoding
header is updated if the body is changed.

Fixed major fault in elibbase write_to_file method - it wasn't closing the
source file by calling stop() when it finished writing out.

-zps1 removed from c & c++ flags for module build to allow use in module
wrapped applications.

Simple GetCharSet methods added to entities

Fixed fault in date header parsing of 2 digit years - they had 1900 subtracted
from them like 4 digit years for inserting into the struct tm as the struct
counts the year from 1900 onwards.  2 digit years now no longer have 1900
subtracted from them!

2 digit years before 70 are taken to be years 2000 to 2069, 70 and after are
1970 - 1999. This is so that if old email software creating 2 digit years in
date fields is still in use in the next century, EmailLib will interpret the
year correctly.  If they and EmailLib based software are still in use by 2070
I'll be very surprised....I'll also be 96!

===============================================================================
Version:	0.46
Date:		1998-10-02
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_EmailLib-0_46

Changed ELIB_TE enum (encoding enum) so that 7BIT and NONE are different.
NONE is text is host OS system text format, 7BIT is RFC 7BIT format.

Added support for CC header in header class which got missed in 0.45.

headers class merging of headers between entitys changed so that the new
headers are appended to the current list.  ie. merging a MIMEentity into a
rfc822msg entity, the headers from the MIMEentity are now correctly appended
to the rfc822msg entity's headers and not put at the start.

Creation of base class address header and WriteOut (from class) fixed - changes
in 0.45 broken creation and writing out of address headers.

body class Display() method modified to take note of the difference between
7BIT and NONE encoding

Library version now put in MIME-Version header field body comment

===============================================================================
Version:	0.45
Date:		1998-10-01
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_EmailLib-0_45

Multiple address support added to source and destination headers with the
creation of a new class "mailbox" to model the mailbox token in RFC822.  Not
100% compliant yet as group names are not supported.  Base source/destination
header class "from" modified to use mailboxes.

CC header added.

Moved ApplyEncoding/RemoveEncoding implemenation from MIMEentity into entity
class.

8BIT decode support added.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.44
Date:		1998-08-28
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_EmailLib-0_44

Major type name changes to remove NetFax specifics from library.  All NFE
prefixes are changed to ELIB.

BOOL, TRUE and FALSE changed to correct c++ bool, true and false.

Shared/Common Email library types moved to a new library in:
RiscOS/Sources/Lib/EMail/Common

EmailLib is now dependant on this new library.

This version of EmailLib does not work with any current version of NFELib
(NetFax Email library - version at this time is 0.49).  NFELib needs to be
modified to use ELIB type names internally in it's calls to EmailLib.  The
last of the NFE code in EmailLib, the X-NetFax header types, will be moved
to NFELib once NFELib is updated and the EmailLib development branch changes
are merged in to EmailLib on the TRUNK.

Current NFELib can continue to use the EmailLib on that's on the Daytona
branch with it.


===============================================================================
Version:	0.43
Date:		1998-05-27
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_EmailLib-0_43

C++FLAGS changed in Makefile to remove function names from the object code.
Saves a bit of code space.

===============================================================================
Version:	0.42
Date:		1998-05-14
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_EmailLib-0_42

Fixed Content-Type headers with no parameters from failing to parse correctly
 - PAN-01174.

===============================================================================
Version:	0.41
Date:		1998-04-17
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_EmailLib-0_41

Fixed Subject to return comments in subject's text field - PAN-01831.
