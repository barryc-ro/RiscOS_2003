 * Return a pointer to the leaf of 'FullPath'.
 * Note that this pointer is within the 'FullPath' string.
 * If no separator (dot or colon) is encountered in FullPath, then the
 * pointer FullPath is returned.
 *
 * It is assumed that if any colons appear, then you either have a proper
 * pathname (SCSI::...) in which case a dot will appear before the leafname,
 * or you're using a path MyPath:FileName, so : is treated the same as .
