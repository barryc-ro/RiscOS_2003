/* Returns just the window part of the Desk_window_info block (strips icon defn.s)
 * The real solution would be to find out how many icons were in the window
 * and then get a flex block big enough for the whole thing and then do it,
 * but you can't read the number of icons until you have read the Desk_window_info
 * so it's a bit difficult! As a result, I just use a 4kB block to hold
 * the window definition in.
 *
 *      NOTE THAT THIS WILL CRASH IF A WINDOW HAS TOO MANY ICONS!!!!!
 *      (anything more than about 120 icons will cause undefined results)
