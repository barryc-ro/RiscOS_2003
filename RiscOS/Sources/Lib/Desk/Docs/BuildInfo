		How Desk is built


Desk's directory tree.

This is slightly unusual. First, all source is within a '!DeskSrc'
directory. This sets the system variable <Desk_Sources$Dir> to point to
the '!DeskSrc' directory itseld. This variable is used in build so that
embedded filenames in AOF files are things like
'<Desk_Sources$Dir>.Libraries.Jump.MemCheck.^.c.J_Error'. Thus things
like __FILE__ expand to full pathnames, and debugging data from cc -g
includes full filenames; MemCheck can then provide throwback into Desk
source for example.


Desk consists of around 60 sub-libraries. They are each in a directory
inside '!DeskSrc.Libraries'. In addition, other libraries for debugging
are in '!DeskSrc.OtherLibs'.
