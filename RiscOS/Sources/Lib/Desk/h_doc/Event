    Version: 1.01 (14 Jul 1993)
    Purpose: High-level WIMP event dispatch to a hierarchy of user event
             handling functions.
    Mods:    14 July 1993 - Added Desk_Event_Initialise3
             20 Mar 1995  - JPS Added veneers for global vars for use with DLLs
             22 Jul 1996  - JPS Added Desk_Event_MessagesClaim and

/*  NOTES
 *  =====
 *
 *  Event supplies a set of high-level functions for proper handling of WIMP
 *  events.
 *  It polls the WIMP for you, and then passes the resulting event to one of
 *  your designated handler routines. Events are cascaded down through your
 *  handlers until one of them returns Desk_bool_TRUE, indicating that the event has
 *  been successfully dealt with. This allows you to have application-wide
 *  defaults for certain event types, with occasional overrides of that
 *  default for specific windows or icons.
 *
 *  Handlers can be registered for the following (priority-ordered) things:
 *
 *    Specific window, specific icon, specific event.
 *    Specific window, specific icon, any event.
 *    Specific window, any icon, specific event.
 *    Specific window, any icon, any event.
 *    Any window, specific event.
 *    Any window, any event.
 *
 *  When an non window-related event occurs, the order is as follows:
 *
 *    Any window, specific event.
 *    Any window, any event.
 *
 *  A set of default handlers is also provided (handlers.c): You can copy
 *  the code for the handlers you need into your own program as a base event
 *  handling system.
 *
 *  Any event which has no registered handlers will automatically be masked
 *  out in subsequent Desk_Wimp_Polls. (Except for "Quit" messages)
 *
 *  NULL events are treated (slightly) specially compared to other events.
 *  After registering handler(s) for NULL events they will be turned on.
 *  (They will NOT be turned on if you request a handler for ALL events. To
 *  enable NULL events, you must specifically register a handler for
 *  Desk_event_NULL events.)
 *  As a default, Desk_Wimp_Poll will be used, but functions are supplied for
 *  you to set a minimum return time (as in Desk_Wimp_PollIdle) if NULL events
 *  are wanted less frequently 
 *  TWO options for NULL event handling are open to you:
 *    Each NULL event is passed to ALL registered handlers,
 *      (To allow you to do important things as often as possible)
 *    Each handler gets one NULL event in turn, in a round-robin fashion.
 *      (To allow you to multitask several "subtask" functions alongside
 *       each other with ease)

all handlers registered  with Desk_Event_ClaimNullIdle who asked to be

registered handler when calling Wimp_PollIdle.

Things are a lot simpler if you don't call Desk_Event_Claim( event_NULL,

If you want to be called regularly, your handler should call
Desk_Event_ClaimNullIdle() each time it runs.

Note that if Desk_Event_ClaimNullIdle is called from within a handler
previously set up with a call to Desk_Event_ClaimNullIdle, the nullidle claim
will be internally marked as inactive until all relevent nullidle
handlers have been called. This avoids infinite loops when handlers call
