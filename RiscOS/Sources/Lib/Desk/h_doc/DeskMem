    File:    DeskMem.h
    Author:  Copyright © 1995 Julian Smith, based on idea from Ijith 
                              Ponnampalavanar
    Version: 1.20 (18 Nov 1995)
    Purpose: Standard error-handling functions for allocating immovable bits
             of memory.
             Facilities for changing the raw allocation functions (they are
             initially ANSI C's malloc, realloc, calloc and free).
             Some functions for simple buffers.
    History: 1.00 (07 Sep 1995)
             1.10 (29 Sep 1995) JS Added Desk_DeskMem_Buffer* functions.
             1.11 (10 Nov 1995) JS Split things into separate .c files etc.
             1.12 (14 Nov 1995) JS Added support for debug DeskLib.
             1.20 (18 Nov 1995) JS Added support for changing the raw
                                   allocation functions - 
                                   Desk_DeskMem_SetAllocFunctions. Also added
                                   macros for accessing the raw functions
                                   without Desk_DeskMem_Malloc's error-checking.
             1.21 (13 Jun 1996) JS Desk_DeskMem_BufferInit sets buffer pointer
                                   to NULL rather than initialising to increment.

old function, or if the new functions are simple wrapper-functions.

Thus if 'by'<0, then 'at' is the /end/ of the deleted region, while if
'by'>0, 'at' is the /start/ of the new region. This behaviour mimics
that of flex_midextend().

Note that this calls Desk_DeskMem_BufferRealloc, so will probably move
the buffer. Hence any pointers into the buffer are made invalid by this
call.
