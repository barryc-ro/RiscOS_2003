 * the state that existed before irqs_off was called.  The value is
 * opaque (and WILL differ depending on the No32bitCode/No26bitCode macros)
 * and may not be inspected - even to determine whether it is zero or not -
 * as it may contain further information.

 * ensure_irqs_off forces IRQs to be disabled, restore_irqs takes the

 * always enables IRQs and returns a value that can be passed to
 * restore_irqs later to restore the state.
 *
 * As for the ANC veneers, the value returned is opaque and must not be
 * interpreted in any way.
