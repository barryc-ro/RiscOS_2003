 * This function should be called before doing any floating point operations
 * in a module. It cannot be called from interrupt routines. Note that if
 * the caller was on the verge of generating a floating point exception (e.g.
 * divide by zero), then the exception will be generated by your own
 * floating point code instead. Since raising your own exceptions would be
 * very ugly, all exceptions are disabled in the FPSR setup.
 *
 * Remember that the routine which calls this function may not then start
 * using floating point code itself, it must invoke another APCS routine
 * to do that. You must have a 32-bit FPEmulator module (there is no 'Z' in
 * the help string).
