rpc Change log

01/09/92 JRS rpc.h svc.h        removed nested comments to stop compiler warnings.

14/09/92 JRS clnt.h             added exported functions clntudp_starttransfer() and
             zm.clnt.h          clntudp_polltransfer() to get faster transfers by using
             clntudp.c          coroutines to allow more than one request packet in the
             zm.clntudp.c       system at once. This saves about 30% on large file
                                transfer time.

18/09/92 JRS clntudp.c          removed debugging and timing code.
             zm.clntudp.c       Added Jonathan Roach's timeout changes to clntudp_call

30/09/92 JRS Makefile           removed Makefile from top level of rpc. This was just
                                a copy of the Makefile in rpc.rpc, and is unused.
01/10/92 JRS s.callback         Changed <Hdr$Dir>. to Hdr: (making entire tcpip tree systematic)
             zm.s.callback
