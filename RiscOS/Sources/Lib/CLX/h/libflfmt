/*
 * A library file is a chunk file containing (at least) the following chunks:-
 * (see chunkflfmt.h for a description of the format of chunk files)
 *
 * LIB_DIRY - a directory of library members
 * LIB_TIME - a time stamp on the whole library
 * LIB_VRSN - a version number for the library
 * LIB_DATA - one or more chunks with this name are the library members.
 *
 * A directory chunk is a sequence of entry records in the format
 * described below (lib_direntry).
