Important note
--------------

Note that the makefile provided doesn't conform with the targets needed
for a ROM build - it only makes the library 'clx'.

Thus CLX shouldn't be used in a ROM build at the moment. If this is
required, someone will have to modify the makefile appropriately.


CLX library
-----------


This library is used in some of Acorn DDE tools, such as find, diff etc.
It has functions for regular expression matching, AOF file manipulation
etc.

CLX was originally on the Aquarius NFS mount.
