Directory Enumeration
=====================

Neil Bingham, Wed 10th November 1999

Code imported from original CLX on Aquarius.
No non-RISC OS support included.

Changes made to get it to compile:

wholefls.c had internal macros netfix_check_path and netfix_done declared internally
that are required by dir.c.  Definitions now moved to wholefls.h
