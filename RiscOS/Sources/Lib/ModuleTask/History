Module can now be RMKilled even if the task is running - calls
Wimp_CloseDown. Note that the client can veto this if its finalise
function returns an error.


14 Jun 1996

Renamed library files MT_M and MT_M_D, to fit with my use of
$(LibSuffix) in makefiles.


27 Jun 1996

Bug-fix: now passes service calls on to client.


09 Jul 1996

Added conditional code for when ModuleTask_DESKTOP is predefined. This
will allow the module-task to start up in response to '*Desk_Foo'
directly, instead of requiring the full '*Desktop'+service calls.

Not decided how to do it yet - awaiting Robin...


14 Aug 1996

Added debug diagnostics at start of command-handler



16 Aug 1996

Calling Desk_Error2_Init_JumpSig in both module init and task init
causes problems?

When returning from task, need to set taskhanfle to -1 if returning
before calling Wimp_Poll. Otherwise the OS/ModuleTask will attempt to
restart the task.



25 Oct 1996

Added 'disable_stack_extension = 1' to start of module runcode
(...c.ModuleTask, function ModuleTask__ModuleEnter()).


25 Mar 1997

Replaced *(int*)"TASK" by 0x4b534154 - the first doesn't work with
MemCheck.CC's -zpc1 flag.


27 Mar 1997

Made MemCheck version. Stack created for USR mode by _blib_entermodule
now has a proper chunk header. Added some extra diagnostics and
checking.


11 Apr 1997

Freeing of _blib_entermodule's stack was incorrect, causing 'Not a heap
block' error when module entry point returned. Fixed.

Stopped claiming Service_Memory - this causes 'Next' slot of application
memory to be used by the module task.

20 Jan 1999

Any error encountered while freeing the task stack is now reported.
