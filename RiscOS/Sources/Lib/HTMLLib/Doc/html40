Abstract

This specification defines the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), version
4.0, the publishing language of the World Wide Web. In addition to the text,
multimedia, and hyperlink features of the previous versions of HTML, HTML
4.0 supports more multimedia options, scripting languages, style sheets,
better printing facilities, and documents that are more accessible to users
with disabilities. HTML 4.0 also takes great strides towards the
internationalization of documents, with the goal of making the Web truly
World Wide.

HTML 4.0 is an SGML application conforming to International Standard ISO
8879 -- Standard Generalized Markup Language [ISO8879]). As an SGML
application, the syntax of conforming HTML 4.0 documents is defined by the
combination of the SGML declaration and the document type definition (DTD).
This specification defines the intended interpretation of HTML 4.0 elements
and adds syntax constraints that may not be expressed by the DTD alone.

Status of this document

                     1 About the HTML 4.0 Specification

Contents

  1. How to read the specification
  2. How the specification is organized
  3. Acknowledgments

This document has been written with two types of readers in mind: HTML
authors and HTML implementors. We hope the specification will provide
authors with the tools they need to write efficient, attractive, and
accessible documents, without over-exposing them to HTML's implementation
details. Implementors, however, should find all they need to build user
agents that interpret HTML correctly.

The specification has been written with two modes of presentation in mind:
electronic and printed. Although the two presentations will no doubt be
similar, readers will find some differences. For example, links will not
work in the printed version (obviously), and page numbers will not appear in
the electronic version. In case of a discrepancy, the electronic version is
considered the authoritative version of the document.

1.1 How to read the specification

The specification may be approached in several ways:

   * Read from beginning to end. The specification begins with a general
     presentation of HTML and becomes more and more technical and specific
     towards the end. This is reflected in the specification's main table of
     contents, which presents topical information, and the indexes, which
     present lower level information in alphabetical order.

   * Quick access to information. In order to get information about syntax
     and semantics as quickly as possible, the electronic version of the
     specification includes the following features:
       1. Every reference to an element or attribute is linked to its
          definition in the specification.
       2. Every page will include links to the indexes, so you will never be
          more than two links away from finding the definition of an element
          or attribute.
       3. The front pages of the three sections of the language reference
          manual extend the initial table of contents with more detail about
          each section.

1.2 How the specification is organized

This specification includes the following sections:

Sections 2-3: Introduction to HTML 4.0
     The introduction gives an overview of what can be done with HTML 4.0
     and provides some design tips for developing good HTML habits.

     The brief SGML tutorial gives readers some understanding of HTML's
     relationship to SGML and gives summary information on how to read the
     HTML Document Type Definition (DTD).
Sections 4 - 25: HTML 4.0 reference manual
     The bulk of the reference manual consists of the HTML language
     reference, which defines all elements and attributes of the language.

     This document has been organized by topic rather than by the grammar of
     HTML. Topics are grouped into three categories: structure,
     presentation, and interactivity. Although it is not easy to divide HTML
     constructs perfectly into these three categories, the model reflects
     the designers' experience that separating a document's structure from
     its presentation produces more effective and maintainable documents.

     The language reference consists of the following information:

        o Conventions used by the editors of this specification.

        o How Uniform Resource Locators (URL) play a role in HTML.

        o What characters may appear in an HTML document.

        o Basic data types of an HTML document.

        o Elements that govern the structure of an HTML document, including
          text, lists, tables, links, and included objects, images, and
          applets.

        o Elements that govern the presentation of an HTML document,
          including style sheets, fonts, colors, rules, and other visual
          presentation, and frames for multi-windowed presentations.

        o Elements that govern interactivity with an HTML document,
          including forms for user input and scripts for active documents.

        o The SGML definition of HTML, including the SGML declaration of
          HTML, the HTML DTD, and the list of character entities.

Appendixes
     The appendix contains information about changes from HTML 3.2 and
     performance and implementation notes.
References
Indexes
     Two indexes give readers rapid access to the definition of all elements
     and attributes The indexes also summarize some key characteristics of
     each element and attribute.

To publish information for global distribution, one needs a universally
understood language, a kind of publishing mother tongue that all computers
may potentially understand. The publishing language used by the World Wide
Web is HTML (from HyperText Markup Language).

HTML gives authors the means to:

   * Publish online documents with headings, text, tables, lists, photos,
     etc.
   * Retrieve online information via hypertext links, at the click of a
     button.
   * Design forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use
     in searching for information, making reservations, ordering products,
     etc.
   * Include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips, and other applications
     directly in their documents.

2.1 A brief history of HTML

HTML was originally developed by Tim Berners-Lee while at CERN, and
popularized by the Mosaic browser developed at NCSA. During the course of
the 1990s it has blossomed with the explosive growth of the Web. During this
time, HTML has been extended in a number of ways. The Web depends on Web
page authors and vendors sharing the same conventions for HTML. This has
motivated joint work on specifications for HTML.

HTML 2.0 (November 1995, see [RFC1866]) was developed under the aegis of the
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to codify common practice in late
1994. HTML+ (1993) and [HTML30] (1995) proposed much richer versions of
HTML. Despite never receiving consensus in standards discussions, these
drafts led to the adoption of a range new features. The efforts of the World
Wide Web Consortium's HTML working group to codify common practice in 1996
resulted in HTML 3.2 (January 1997, see [HTML32]).

While most people agree that HTML documents should work well across
different browsers and platforms, achieving interoperability implies higher
costs to content providers since they must develop different versions of
documents. If the effort is not made, however, there is much greater risk
that the Web will devolve into a proprietary world of incompatible formats,
ultimately reducing the Web's commercial potential for all participants.

Each version of HTML has attempted to reflect greater consensus among
industry players so that the investment made by content providers will not
be wasted and that their documents will not become unreadable in a short
period of time.

HTML has been developed with the vision that all manner of devices should be
able to use information on the Web: PCs with graphics displays of varying
resolution and color depths, cellular telephones, hand held devices, devices
for speech for output and input, computers with high or low bandwidth, and
so on.

2.2 HTML 4.0

HTML 4.0 extends HTML with mechanisms for style sheets, scripting, frames,
embedding objects, improved support for right to left and mixed direction
text, richer tables, and enhancements to forms, offering improved
accessibility for people with disabilities.

2.2.1 Internationalization

This version of HTML has been designed with the help of experts in the field
of internationalization, so that documents may be written in every language
and be transported easily around the world. This has been accomplished by
incorporating [RFC2070], which deals with the internationalization of HTML.

One important step has been the adoption of the ISO/IEC:10646 standard (see
[ISO10646]) as the document character set for HTML. This is the world's most
inclusive standard dealing with issues of the representation of
international characters, text direction, punctuation, and other world
language issues.

HTML now offers greater support for diverse human languages within a
document. This allows for more effective indexing of documents for search
engines, higher-quality typography, better text-to-speech conversion,
correct hyphenation, etc.

2.2.2 Accessibility

As the Web community grows and its members diversify in their abilities and
skills, it is crucial that the underlying technologies be appropriate to
their specific needs. HTML has been designed to make Web pages more
accessible to those with physical limitations. HTML 4.0 developments in the
area of accessibility include:

   * Encouraging the use of style sheets (rather than tables) to achieve
     layout effect.
   * Making it easier to provided alternate (textual and aural) descriptions
     of images for non-visual browsers.
   * Providing active labels for form fields
   * Providing labeled hierarchical groupings for form fields.
   * Providing the ability to associate a longer text description with an
     HTML element.

Authors who design pages with accessibility issues in mind will not only
receive the blessings of the accessibility community, but will benefit in
other ways as well: well-designed HTML documents that distinguish structure
and presentation will adapt more easily to new technologies.

2.2.3 Tables

The new table model in HTML is based on [RFC1942]. Authors now have greater
control over structure and layout (e.g., column groups). The ability of
designers to recommend column widths allows user agents to display table
data incrementally (as it arrives) rather than waiting for the entire table
before rendering.

Beware - at the time of writing, some HTML authoring tools rely extensively
on tables for formatting, which may easily cause accessibility problems.

2.2.4 Compound documents

HTML now offers a standard mechanism for embedding generic media objects and
applications in HTML documents. The OBJECT element (together with its more
specific ancestor elements IMG and APPLET) provides a mechanism for
including images, video, sound, mathematics, specialized applications, and
other objects in a document. It also allows authors to specify a hierarchy
of alternate renderings for user agents that don't support a specific
rendering.

2.2.5 Style sheets

Style sheets simplify HTML markup and largely relieve HTML of the
responsibilities of presentation. They give both authors and users control
over the presentation of documents --- font information, alignment, colors,
etc.

Stylistic information can be:

   * Attached to a specific element to affect, say the color or font of its
     content.
   * Placed in the document header as a series of styles comprising a style
     sheet
   * Linked to an HTML from an external style sheet.

The mechanism for associating a style sheet with a document is independent
of the style sheet language.

Before the advent of style sheets, authors had limited control over
rendering. HTML 3.2 included a number of attributes and elements offering
control over alignment, font size, and text color. Authors also exploited
tables and images as a means for laying out pages. The relatively long time
it takes for users to upgrade their browsers means that these features will
continue to be used for some time. However, since style sheets offer more
powerful presentation mechanisms, the World Wide Web Consortium will
eventually phase out many of HTML's presentation elements and attributes.
Throughout the specification elements and attributes at risk are marked as
"deprecated". They are usually accompanied with examples of how to achieve
the same effects using style sheets.

This specification includes three Document Type Definitions (DTDs) that may
be used to validate HTML 4.0 documents. One for use with framesets, a loose
DTD for transitional documents and a strict DTD that excludes presentation
elements and attributes.

2.2.6 Scripting

Through scripts, authors may create "smart forms" that react as users fill
them out. Scripting allows designers to create dynamic Web pages, and to use
HTML as a means to build networked applications. The mechanisms provided to
associate HTML with scripts are independent of particular scripting
languages.

2.2.7 Printing

HTML features (the LINK element) allow user agents to print a collection of
documents in an intelligent manner based on descriptions of the
relationships among documents acting as parts of a larger work.

2.3 Designing documents with HTML 4.0

We recommend that authors and implementors observe the following general
principles when working with HTML 4.0.

2.3.1 Separate structure and presentation

HTML has its roots in SGML which has always been a language for the
specification of structural markup. As HTML matures, more and more of its
presentational elements and attributes are being replaced by other
mechanisms, in particular style sheets. Experience has shown that separating
the structure of a document from its presentational aspects reduces the cost
of serving a wide range of platforms, media, etc., and facilitates document
revisions.

2.3.2 Consider universal accessibility to the Web

To make the Web more accessible to everyone, notably those with
disabilities, authors should consider how their documents may be rendered on
a variety of platforms: speech-based browsers, braille-readers, etc. We do
not recommend that designers limit their creativity, only that they consider
alternate renderings in their design. HTML offers a number of mechanisms to
this end (e.g., the alt attribute, the accesskey attribute, etc.)

Furthermore, authors should keep in mind that their documents may be
reaching a far-off audience with different computer configurations. In order
for documents to be interpreted correctly, designers should include in their
documents information about the language and direction of the text, how the
document is encoded, and other issues related to internationalization.

2.3.3 Help user agents with incremental rendering

By carefully designing their tables and making use of new table features in
HTML 4.0, designers can help user agents render documents more quickly.

This section of the document presents introductory information about SGML
and its relationship to HTML.

HTML 4.0 is an SGML application conforming to International Standard ISO
8879 -- Standard Generalized Markup Language SGML (defined in [ISO8879]).
SGML provides a means for defining markup languages. The basic idea is to
annotate the text of a document with markup tags that provide additional
information about the document's structure and interpretation. A complete
discussion of SGML parsing, e.g. the mapping of a sequence of characters to
a sequence of tags and data, is left to the SGML standard. This section is
only a summary.

An SGML application consists of several parts:

  1. The SGML declaration. The SGML declaration specifies which characters
     and delimiters may appear in the application.
  2. The document type definition (DTD). The DTD defines the syntax of
     markup constructs. The DTD may include additional definitions such as
     numeric and named character entities.
  3. A specification that describes the semantics to be ascribed to the
     markup. This specification also imposes syntax restrictions that cannot
     be expressed within the DTD.
  4. Document instances containing data (contents) and markup. Each instance
     contains a reference to the DTD to be used to interpret it.

The SGML declaration for HTML 4.0 and the DTD for HTML 4.0 are included in
this reference manual, along with the entity sets referenced by the DTD.

3.1 HTML syntax

In this section, we discuss the syntax of HTML elements, attributes, and
comments.

3.1.1 Entities

Character entity references are numeric or symbolic names for characters
that may be included in an HTML document. They are useful when your
authoring tools make it difficult or impossible to enter a character you may
not enter often. You will see character entities throughout this document;
they begin with a "&" sign and end with a semi-colon (;). Some examples
include:

   * "&lt;" represents the < sign.
   * "&gt;" represents the > sign.
   * "&quot; represents the " mark.
   * &#229; (in decimal) represents the letter "a" with a small circle above
     it.
   * &#1048; (in decimal) represents the Cyrillic capital letter "I".
   * &#x6C34; (in hexadecimal) represents to the Chinese character for
     water.

We discuss HTML character entities in detail later in the section on the
HTML document character set.

3.1.2 Elements

An SGML application defines elements that represent structures or desired
behavior. An element typically consists of three parts: a start tag,
content, and an end tag.

An element's start tag is written <element-name>, where element-name is the
name of the element. An element's end tag is written with a slash before the
element name: </element-name>. For example,

<pre>The content of the PRE element is preformatted text.</pre>

HTML allows some elements to be marked up without end tags, for example P
and LI. A few elements also allow the start tags to be omitted for example
HEAD and BODY. The HTML DTD indicates for each element whether the start tag
and end tag are required.

Some HTML elements have no content. For example, the line break element BR
has no content; its only role is to terminate a line of text. Such "empty"
elements never have end tags. The definition of each element in the
reference manual indicates whether it is empty (has no content) or, if it
can have content, what is considered legal content.

Element names are always case-insensitive.

Elements are not tags. Some people refer incorrectly to elements as tags
(e.g., "the P tag"). Remember that the element is one thing, and the tag (be
it start or end tag) is another. For instance, the HEAD element is always
present, even though both start and end HEAD tags may be missing in the
markup.

3.1.3 Attributes

Elements may have associated properties, called attributes, to which authors
assign values. Attribute/value pairs appear before the final ">" of an
element's start tag. Any number of (legal) attribute value pairs, separated
by spaces, may appear in an element's start tag. They may appear in any
order.

In this example, the align attribute is set for the H1 element:

<H1 align="center">
This is a centered heading thanks to the align attribute
</H1>

By default, SGML requires that all attribute values be delimited using
either double quotation marks (ASCII decimal 34) or single quotation marks
(ASCII decimal 39). Single quote marks can be included within the attribute
value when the value is delimited by double quote marks, and vice versa. You
may also use numeric character entities to represent double quotes (&#34;)
and single quotes (&#39;). For double quotes you can also use the named
character entity &quot;.

In certain cases, it is possible in HTML to specify the value of an
attribute without any quotation marks. The attribute value may only contain
letters (a-z and A-Z), digits (0-9), hyphens (ASCII decimal 45), and periods
(ASCII decimal 46). We suggest using quotation marks even when it is
possible to eliminate them.

Attribute names are always case-insensitive.

Attribute values are generally case-insensitive. The definition of each
attribute in the reference manual indicates whether its value is
case-insensitive.

3.1.4 HTML comments

HTML comments have the following syntax:


<!-- this is a comment -->
<!-- and so is this one,
    which occupies more than one line -->

White space is not permitted between the markup declaration open
delimiter("<!") and the comment open delimiter ("--"), but is permitted
between the comment close delimiter ("--") and the markup declaration close
delimiter (">"). A common error is to include a string of hyphens ("---")
within a comment. Authors should avoid putting two or more adjacent hyphens
inside comments.

Comments must not be rendered by user agents as part of a document.

3.1.5 SGML features with limited support

SGML applications conforming to [ISO8879] are expected to recognize a number
of features that aren't widely supported by HTML user agents.

Marked Sections

These play a role similar to the #ifdef construct in the C preprocessor.

<![INCLUDE[
 <!-- this will be included -->
]]>

<![IGNORE[
 <!-- this will be ignored -->
]]>

SGML also defines the use of marked sections for CDATA content, within which
"<" is not treated as the start of a tag, e.g.,

<![CDATA[
 <an> example of <sgml> markup that is
 not <painful> to write with < and such.
]]>

We recommend that authors avoid using marked sections as most HTML user
agents don't recognize them. The telltale sign is the appearance of "]]>",
which is seen when the user agent mistakenly uses the first ">" character as
the end of the tag starting with "<![".

Processing Instructions <?your user agent should hide these>

Processing instructions are a mechanism to capture platform-specific idioms.
A processing instruction begins with <? and ends with >

<?instruction >

For example:

<?>
<?style tt = font courier>
<?page break>
<?experiment> ... <?/experiment>

We recommend that authors avoid using processing instructions in HTML
documents, as many user agents render them as part of the document's text.

Document Type Declaration Subset

SGML provides a way to extend the DTD using the <!DOCTYPE> element, for
instance to add a new set of entity definitions, or to set entities
controlling the use of marked sections.

For example:

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN" [
<!ENTITY % AcmeCorpSymbols SYSTEM
   "-//Acme Corp//ENTITIES Corporate Symbols//EN">
%AcmeCorpSymbols;
]>

We recommend that authors avoid using the DTD subset as most HTML user
agents do not support this feature.

User agents must not render SGML processing instructions (e.g., <?full
volume>).

Shorthand Markup Prohibited

Some constructs save typing, but add no expressive capability to the
language. And while they technically introduce no ambiguity, they reduce the
robustness of documents, especially when the language is enhanced to include
new elements. Thus, while the SHORTTAG constructs of SGML related to
attributes are widely used and implemented, those related to elements are
not.

These are relatively straightforward to support, but they are not widely
deployed. While documents that use them are conforming SGML documents, they
will not work with the deployed HTML tools.

   * NET tags
         <name/.../
   * closed Start Tag
         <name1<name2>
   * Empty Start Tag
         <>
   * Empty End Tag
         </>

3.2 How to read the HTML DTD

This specification presents pertinent fragments of the DTD each time an
element or attribute is defined. The DTD fragment gives concise information
about an element and its attributes. We have chosen to include the DTD
fragments in the specification rather than seek a more approachable, but
longer and less precise means of describing an element. While almost all of
the definitions include enough English text to make them comprehensible, for
those who require definitive information, we complete this specification
with a brief tutorial on reading the HTML DTD.

3.2.1 Block level and Inline elements

Certain HTML elements are said to be "block level" while others are "inline"
(also known as "text level"). The distinction is founded on several notions:

Content model
     Generally, block level elements may contain inline elements and other
     block level elements. Generally, inline elements may contain only data
     and other inline elements. Inherent in this structural distinction is
     the idea that block elements create "larger" structures than inline
     elements.
Formatting
     By default, block level are formatted differently than inline elements.
     Generally, Block level elements begin on new lines, inline elements do
     not. Block level elements end an unterminated paragraph element. This
     enables you to omit end-tags for paragraphs in many cases.
Directionality
     For technical reasons involving the [UNICODE] bidirectional text
     algorithm, block level and inline elements differ in how they inherit
     directionality information. For details, see the section on inheritance
     of text direction.

Style sheets provide the means to specify the rendering of arbitrary
elements, including whether an element is rendered as block or inline. In
some cases, such as an inline style for list elements, this may be
appropriate, but generally speaking, authors are discouraged from overriding
the conventional interpretation of HTML elements in this way.

The alteration of the traditional presentation idioms for block level and
inline elements also has an impact on the bidirectional text algorithm. See
the section on the effect of style sheets on bidirectionality for more
information.

3.2.2 DTD Comments

In DTDs, comments may spread over one or more lines. In the DTD, comments
are delimited by a pair of "--" marks, e.g.

<!ELEMENT PARAM - O EMPTY       -- named property value -->

Here, the comment "named property value" explains the use of the PARAM
element. DTD comments for HTML do have not normative value.

3.2.3 Parameter entity definitions

The HTML DTD begins with a series of entity definitions. A parameter entity
definition (not to be confused with an SGML entity) defines a kind of macro
that may be expanded elsewhere in the DTD. When the macro is referred to by
name in the DTD, it is expanded into a string.

A parameter entity definition begins with the keyword <!ENTITY % followed by
the entity name, the quoted string the entity expands to, and finally a
closing >. The following example defines the string that the %font entity
will expand to.

<!ENTITY % font "TT | I | B | U | S | BIG | SMALL">

The string the parameter entity expands to may contain other parameter
entity names. These names are expanded recursively. In the following
example, the %inline parameter entity is defined to include the %font,
%phrase, %special and %formctrl parameter entities.

<!ENTITY % inline "#PCDATA | %font | %phrase | %special | %formctrl">

You will encounter two DTD entities frequently in the HTML DTD: %inline and
%blocklevel. They are used when the content model includes inline and block
level elements respectively.

3.2.4 Element definitions

The bulk of the HTML DTD consists of the definitions of elements and their
attributes. The <!ELEMENT keyword begins an element definition and the >
character ends it. Between these are specified:

  1. The element's name.
  2. Whether the element's end tag is optional. Two hyphens that appear
     after the element name mean that the start and end tags are mandatory.
     One hyphen followed by the letter "O" (not zero) indicates that the end
     tag can be omitted. A pair of letter "O"s indicate that both the start
     and end tags can be omitted.
  3. The element's content, if any. The allowed content for an element is
     called its content model. Elements with no content are called empty
     elements. Empty elements are defined with the keyword "EMPTY".

In this example:

    <!ELEMENT UL - - (LI)+>

   * The element being defined is UL.
   * The two hyphens indicate that both the start tag <UL> and the end tag
     </UL> for this element are required.
   * The content model for this element defined to be "at least one LI
     element". We describe content models in detail below.

This example illustrates the definition of an empty element:

    <!ELEMENT IMG - O EMPTY>

   * The element being defined is IMG.
   * The hyphen and the following "O" indicate that the end tag can be
     omitted, but together with the content model "EMPTY", this is
     strengthened to the rule that the end tag must be omitted.
   * The "EMPTY" keyword means the element must not have content.

Content model definitions

The content model describes what may be contained by an element. Content
definitions may include:

   * The names of allowed or forbidden elements (e.g., the UL element
     includes instances of the LI element).
   * DTD entities (e.g., the LABEL element includes instances of the %inline
     parameter entity).
   * Document text (indicated by the SGML construct "#PCDATA"). Text may
     contain numeric and named character entities. Recall that these begin
     with & and end with a semicolon (e.g., "Herg&eacute;'s adventures of
     Tintin" includes the named entity for the "e acute" character).

The content model use the following syntax to define what markup is allowed
for the content of the element:

( ... )
     Specifies a group.
A | B
     Either A or B must occur but not both.
A , B
     Both A and B must occur in that order.
A & B
     Both A and B must occur, but may do so in any order.
A?
     A can occur zero or one times
A*
     A can occur zero or more times
A+
     A can occur one or more times

Here are some examples from the HTML DTD:

<!ELEMENT SELECT - - (OPTION+)>

     The SELECT element must contain one or more OPTION elements.

<!ELEMENT DL - - (DT|DD)+>

     The DL element must contain one or more DT or DD elements in any order.

<!ELEMENT OPTION - O (#PCDATA)*>

     The OPTION element may only contain text and entities, such as &amp;

A few HTML elements use an additional SGML feature to exclude certain
elements from content model. Excluded elements are preceded by a hyphen.
Explicit exclusions override inclusions.

In this example, the -(A) signifies that the element A cannot be included in
another A element (i.e., anchors may not be nested).

   <!ELEMENT A - - (%inline)* -(A)>

Note that the A element is part of the DTD parameter entity %inline, but is
excluded explicitly because of -(A).

Similarly, the following element definition for FORM prohibits nested forms:

   <!ELEMENT FORM - - %block -(FORM)>

3.2.5 Attribute definitions

The <!ATTLIST keyword begins the definition of attributes that an element
may take. It is followed by the name of the element in question, a list of
attribute definitions, and a closing >. An attribute definition is a triplet
that defines:

   * The name of an attribute.
   * The type of the attribute's value or an explicit set of possible
     values. Values defined explicitly by the DTD are case-insensitive.
   * Whether the default value of the attribute is implicit (keyword
     "#IMPLIED"), in which case the default value must be supplied by the
     user agent (in some cases via inheritance from parent elements); always
     required (keyword "#REQUIRED"); or fixed to the given value (keyword
     "#FIXED"). Some attributes explicitly specify a default value for the
     attribute.

In this example, the name attribute is defined for the MAP element. The
attribute is optional for this element.

<!ATTLIST MAP
  name        CDATA     #IMPLIED
  >

The type of values permitted for the attribute is given as CDATA, an SGML
data type. CDATA is text that may include character entities.

For more information about "CDATA", "NAME", "ID", and other data types,
please consult the section on HTML data types.

The following examples illustrate possible attribute definitions:

rowspan     NUMBER     1         -- number of rows spanned by cell --
http-equiv  NAME       #IMPLIED  -- HTTP response header name  --
id          ID         #IMPLIED  -- document-wide unique id --
valign      (top|middle|bottom|baseline) #IMPLIED

The rowspan attribute requires values of type NUMBER. The default value is
given explicitly as "1". The optional http-equiv attribute requires values
of type NAME. The optional id attribute requires values of type ID. The
optional valign attribute is constrained to take values from the set {top,
middle, bottom, baseline}.

DTD entities in attribute definitions

Attribute definitions may also include DTD entities.

In this example, we see that the attribute definition list for the LINK
element begins with the %attrs parameter entity.

<!ELEMENT LINK - O EMPTY -- a media-independent link -->
<!ATTLIST LINK
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  charset     CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- char encoding of linked resource --
  href        %URL;      #IMPLIED  -- URL for linked resource --
  rel         CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- forward link types --
  rev         CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- reverse link types --
  type    %ContentType;  #IMPLIED  -- advisory Internet content type --
  media       CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- for rendering on these media --
  target      CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- where to render linked resource --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: forbidden

The %attrs parameter entity is defined as follows:

<!ENTITY % attrs "%coreattrs; %i18n; %events;">

The %coreattrs parameter entity in the %attrs definition expands as follows:

<!ENTITY % coreattrs
 "id          ID         #IMPLIED  -- document-wide unique id --
  class       CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- space separated list of classes --
  style       CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- associated style info --
  title       CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- advisory title/amplification --"
  >

The %attrs parameter entity has been defined for convenience since these
attributes are defined for most HTML elements.

Similarly, the DTD defines the %URL parameter entity as expanding into the
string CDATA.

<!ENTITY % URL "CDATA"
    -- a Uniform Resource Locator,
       see [RFC1808] and [RFC1738]
    -->

As this example illustrates, the parameter entity %URL provides readers of
the DTD with more information as to the type of data expected for an
attribute. Similar entities have been defined for %Color, %ContentType,
%Length, %Pixels, etc.

Boolean attributes

Some attributes play the role of boolean variables (e.g., selected). Their
appearance in the start tag of an element implies that the value of the
attribute is "true". Their absence implies a value of "false".

Boolean attributes may legally take a single value: the name of the
attribute itself (e.g., selected="selected").

This example defines the selected attribute to be a boolean attribute.

selected     (selected)  #IMPLIED  -- reduced inter-item spacing --

The attribute is set to "true" by appearing in the element's start tag:

<OPTION selected="selected">
...contents...
<OPTION>

Minimized boolean attributes In HTML, boolean attributes may be appear in
"minimized form" -- the attribute's value appears alone in the element's
start tag. Thus:

<OPTION selected>

       2. Notes and examples
  3. SGML

Below we list some definitions and conventions adopted in this
specification.

4.1 Definitions

Degrees of obligation
     Words such as "must", "should", "can", and "may" are used in accordance
     with [RFC2119]. At times, the authors of this specification also
     provide, in the form of recommendations, guidelines to good usage or
     good implementations. These recommendations are not normative and
     conformance with this specification does not depend on their execution.
User agent
     A user agent is any device that interprets HTML documents. User agents
     include visual browsers (text-only and graphical), non-visual browsers
     (audio, Braille), search robots, proxies, etc.
Conforming user agent
     A conforming user agent for HTML 4.0 is one that observes the mandatory
     conditions ("must") set forth in this specification, including the
     following points:
        o A user agent must try to render the content of any element it does
          not recognize.
        o A user agent must ignore any attribute it does not recognize.
        o A user agent should avoid imposing arbitrary length limits on
          string literals.
        o A user agent should ensure the rendering is unchanged by the
          presence or absence of start tags and end tags when the HTML DTD
          indicates these are optional.

     This specification does not define how conforming user agents should
     handle general error conditions.
Deprecated
     A deprecated element or attribute is one that has been outdated by
     newer constructs. Deprecated elements are defined in the reference
     manual in appropriate locations, but are clearly marked as deprecated.
     Deprecated elements may become obsolete in future versions of HTML.

     We recommend that authors avoid using deprecated elements and
     attributes whenever practical. To this end, we provide alternatives to
     them when appropriate in the specification. In most cases these depend
     on user agent support for style sheets.

     User agents should continue to support deprecated elements for reasons
     of backward compatibility.
Obsolete
     An obsolete element or attribute is one for which there is no guarantee
     of support by a user agent. Obsolete elements are no longer defined in
     the specification, but are listed for historical purposes in the
     changes section of the reference manual.

4.2 Document conventions

This specification presents elements in a "semantic" order, from most basic
to most sophisticated constructs. Elements may be discussed in several
different contexts depending on their use (e.g., DIV as a structuring
element and DIV and its role with style sheets). Despite scattered
references, the specification defines each element and attribute in one
location only.

4.2.1 Elements and attributes

Similarly, attributes that apply to many elements (e.g., lang, dir, class,
etc.) are defined where most appropriate semantically. Consequently, an
element definition may include a reference to an attribute that may be
defined elsewhere. When this is the case, the location of the definition is
clearly indicated and for the electronic version of the specification,
accessible by a link.

Definitions of elements and attributes clearly indicate which are
deprecated. In such cases, the specification includes examples of better
HTML usage.

In the electronic version of the specification, all references to an element
or attribute (from the index or in the specification text) are linked to its
definition.

Element names are written in upper case letters (e.g., BODY). Attribute
names are written in lower case letters (e.g., lang, onsubmit). Recall that
in HTML, element and attribute names are case-insensitive. Our convention is
designed to encourage readability of the specification.

Element and attribute names are marked within the source HTML for the
specification and may be rendered specially depending on your user agent.

The type of an attribute's value is specified in its definition. However, if
the set of possible values is small, the values are listed explicitly,
separated by a bar (|). The first value in this list is the default value.

4.2.2 Notes and examples

Informative notes are emphasized to stand out from surrounding text. How the
emphasis is rendered depends on your user agent.

All examples illustrating deprecated usage are marked as "DEPRECATED
EXAMPLE". Deprecated examples also include recommended alternate solutions.
All examples that illustrates illegal usage are clearly marked as "ILLEGAL
EXAMPLE".

Examples and notes are marked within the source HTML for the specification
and may be rendered specially depending on your user agent.

4.3 SGML

Comments appearing in the HTML 4.0 DTD have no normative value; they are
informative only.

                               5 HTML and URLs

Contents

  1. Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)
       1. Fragment identifiers
       2. Relative URLs
       3. URLs in HTML

The World Wide Web is a network of information resources. The Web relies on
three mechanisms to make these resources readily available to the widest
possible audience:

  1. A uniform naming scheme for locating resources on the Web, e.g. URLs
  2. Protocols, for access to named resources over the Web. e.g. HTTP
  3. Hypertext, for easy navigation among resources. e.g. HTML

HTML documents utilize URLs for specifying hypertext links. The following
provides a brief introduction to URLs.

5.1 Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)

Every resource available on the Web --- HTML document, image, video clip,
program, etc. --- has an address that may be encoded by a Uniform Resource
Locator, or "URL" (defined in [RFC1738]).

URLs typically consist of three pieces:

  1. The scheme identifying the protocol used to access the resource.
  2. The name of the machine hosting the resource.
  3. The name of the resource itself, given as a path.

Consider the URL that designates the current HTML specification:

http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html4/cover.html

This URL may be read as follows: Use the HTTP protocol (see [RFC2068]) to
transfer the data residing on the machine www.w3.org in the file
"/TR/WD-html4/cover.html". Other schemes you may see in HTML documents
include "mailto" for email and "ftp" for FTP.

URLs in general are case-sensitive (with the exception of machine names).
There may be URLs, or parts of URLs, where case doesn't matter, but
identifying these may not be easy. Users should always consider that URLs
are case-sensitive.

The character set of URLs that appear in HTML is specified in [RFC1738].

5.1.1 Fragment identifiers

Some URLs refer to a location within a resource. As specified in [RFC1808],
this kind of URL ends with "#" followed by an anchor identifier (called the
"fragment identifier"). For instance, here is a URL pointing to an anchor
named section_2:

http://somesite.com/html/top.html#section_2

5.1.2 Relative URLs

A relative URL (defined in [RFC1808]) doesn't contain any protocol or
machine information. Its path generally refers to a resource on the same
machine as the current document. Relative URLs may contain relative path
components (".." means one level up in the hierarchy defined by the path),
and may contain fragment identifiers.

Relative URLs are resolved to full URLs using a base URL. [RFC1808] defines
the normative algorithm for this process.

As an example of relative URL resolution, assume we have the base URL
"http://www.acme.com/support/intro.html". The relative URL in the following
markup for a hypertext link:

  <A href="suppliers.html">Suppliers</A>

would expand to the full URL "http://www.acme.com/support/suppliers.html",
while the relative URL in the following markup for an image

  <IMG src="../icons/logo.gif" alt="logo">

would expand to the full URL "http://www.acme.com/icons/logo.gif".

5.1.3 URLs in HTML

In HTML, URLs play a role in these situations:

   * linking to another document or resource, (see the A and LINK elements).
   * linking to an external style sheet or script (see the LINK and SCRIPT
     elements).
   * images, objects and applets for inclusion in a page, (see the IMG,
     OBJECT, APPLET and INPUT elements).
   * image maps (see the MAP and AREA elements).
   * form submission (see FORM).
   * frames (see the FRAME and IFRAME elements).
   * citing an external reference (see the Q, BLOCKQUOTE, INS and DEL
     elements).
   * referring to metadata conventions describing a document (see the HEAD
     element).

User agents should calculate the base URL for resolving relative URLs
according to the [RFC1808]. The following is a summary of how [RFC1808]
applies to HTML. User agents should calculate the base URL according to the
following precedences (highest priority to lowest):

  1. The base URL is set by the BASE element.
  2. The base URL is given by an HTTP header (see [RFC2068]).
  3. By default, the base URL is that of the current document.

Additionally, the OBJECT and APPLET elements define attributes that take
precedence over the value set by the BASE element. Please consult the
definitions of these elements for more information about URL issues specific
to them.

Link elements specified by HTTP headers are handled exactly as LINK elements
that appear explicitly in a document.

MAILTO URLs

In addition to HTTP URLs, authors might want to include MAILTO URLs (see
[RFC1738]) in their documents. MAILTO URLs cause email to be sent to some
email address. For instance, the author might create a link that, when
activated, causes the user agent to open a mail program with the destination
address in the "To:" field.

MAILTO URLs have the following syntax:

mailto:email-address

User agents may support MAILTO URL extensions that are not yet Internet
standards (e.g., appending subject information to a URL with the syntax
"?Subject=my%20subject" where any space characters are replaced by "%20").
Some user agents also support "?Cc=email-address".

                        6 HTML Document Character Set

Contents

  1. The Document Character Set
  2. Character entities

6.1 The Document Character Set

Human languages make use of a large number of text characters and human
beings have invented a wide variety of systems for representing these
characters in a computer. Unless proper precautions are taken, differing
character representations may not be understood by user agents in all parts
of the world.

To promote interoperability, SGML requires that each application (including
HTML) define its document character set. A document character set is a set
of abstract characters (such as the Cyrillic letter "I", the Chinese
character meaning "water", etc.) and a corresponding set of integer
references to those characters. SGML considers a document to be a sequence
of references in the document character set.

The document character set for HTML is the Universal Character Set (UCS) of
[ISO10646]. This set is character-by-character equivalent to Unicode 2.0
([UNICODE]). Both of these standards are updated from time to time with new
characters and the amendments should be consulted at the respective Web
sites. In the current specification, references to ISO/IEC-10646 or Unicode
imply the same document character set. However, the current document also
refers to the Unicode specification for other issues such as the
bidirectional text algorithm.

Authors are not required to write HTML documents as a series of integer
references to the document character set. Instead, they may input characters
in a chosen character encoding, which encodes some subset of the document
character set. Authors are not required to enter a document's text in a
character encoding (such as UCS-4) that covers the entire document character
set --- this would be inconvenient and make the document larger. The choice
of character encoding often depends on the characters than can be easily
input via a keyboard or by the way files are stored on secondary storage
devices. Any convenient encoding that covers most of the characters the
author will employ can be used, provided it is correctly labeled (as
explained below). Occasional characters that fall outside this encoding may
still be entered, in the form of numeric character references which always
refer to the document character set, not the encoding.

Conforming user agents must correctly map to Unicode all characters in any
character encodings ("charsets") that they recognize (or they must behave as
if they did). Names for characters encodings are generally case insensitive.

Note. A list of recommended character encodings for various scripts and
languages will be provided in a separate document.

Character encodings such as ISO-8859-1 (commonly referred to as "Latin-1"
since it encodes most Western European languages), ISO-8859-5 (which
supports Cyrillic), SHIFT_JIS (a Japanese encoding), and EUC-JP (another
Japanese encoding) save bandwidth for uncompressed text by representing only
slices of the document character set. When compressed, however, there is
little advantage over full encodings of Unicode such as UTF-16.

How does a user agent know which character encoding has been used to encode
a given document?

In many cases, before a Web server sends an HTML document over the Web, it
tries to figure out the character encoding (by a variety of techniques such
as examining the first few bytes of the file, checking against a database of
known files and encodings, etc.). The server transmits the document and the
name of the character encoding to the receiving user agent by way of the
charset parameter of the HTTP "Content-Type" field. For example, the
following HTTP header announces that the character encoding is "EUC-JP".

Content-Type: text/html; charset=EUC-JP

The value of the "charset" parameter must be the name of a "charset" as
defined in [RFC2045].

Unfortunately, not all servers send information about the character encoding
(even when the character encoding is different from the widely used
ISO-8859-1 encoding). HTML therefore allows authors a way to tell user
agents which character encoding has been used by specifying it explicitly in
the document header with the META element. For example, to specify that the
character encoding of the current document is "euc-jp", include the
following META declaration:

<META http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=EUC-JP">

The META declaration must only be used when the character encoding is
organized such that ASCII characters stand for themselves at least until the
META element is parsed. In this case, conforming user agents must correctly
interpret the META element.

To sum up, conforming user agents must observe the following priorities when
determining a document's character encoding (from highest priority to
lowest):

  1. Explicit user action to override erroneous behavior.
  2. An HTTP "charset" parameter in a "Content-Type" field.
  3. A META declaration with "http-equiv" set to "Content-Type" and a value
     set for "charset".
  4. The "charset" attribute set for the A and LINK elements.
  5. User agent heuristics and user settings. For example, user many agents
     use a heuristic to distinguish between the various encodings used for
     Japanese text. Also, user agents typically have an user-definable local
     default character encoding which they apply in absence of other
     indicators.

Note: some HTTP/1.1 [RFC 2068, Section 3.7.1] servers may be using the
absence of a charset parameter in a Content-Type field incorrectly to mean
"this is iso-8859-1." Recipients wishing to defeat this behavior may assume
the existence of a Content-Type field with "charset=iso-8859-1" and ignore
steps 3 to 5 above.

In all cases, the value of the "charset" attribute or parameter must be the
name of a "charset" as defined in [RFC2045].

If, for a specific application, it becomes necessary to refer to characters
outside [ISO10646], characters should be assigned to a private zone to avoid
conflicts with present or future versions of the standard. This is highly
discouraged, however, for reasons of portability.

Note: Modern web servers can be configured with information about which
document is using which character encoding. Web masters should use these
facilities but should take pains to configure the server properly.

6.2 Character entities

Your hardware and software configuration probably won't allow you to enter
all Unicode characters through simple input mechanisms, so SGML offers
character encoding-independent mechanisms for specifying any character from
the document character set.

   * Numeric character references (in either decimal or hexadecimal).
   * Named character references.

Numeric character references specify the integer reference of a Unicode
character. A numeric character reference with the syntax &#D; refers to
Unicode decimal character number D. A numeric character reference with the
syntax &#xH; refers to Unicode hexadecimal character number H. The
hexadecimal representation is a new SGML convention and is particularly
useful since character standards generally use hexadecimal representations.

Here are some examples:

   * &#229; (in decimal) represents the letter "a" with a small circle above
     it (used, for example, in Norwegian).
   * &#xE5; (in hexadecimal) represents the same character.
   * &#1048; (in decimal) represents the Cyrillic capital letter "I".
   * &#x6C34; (in hexadecimal) represents to the Chinese character for
     water.

To give authors a more intuitive way to refer to characters in the document
character set, HTML offers a set of named character entities. Named
character references replace integer references with symbolic names. The
named entity &aring; refers to the same Unicode character as &#229;. There
is no named entity for the Cyrillic capital letter "I". The full list of
named character entities recognized in HTML 4.0 is included in this
specification.

Four named character entities deserve special mention since they are
frequently used to escape special characters: For text appearing as part of
the content of an element, you should escape "<" (ASCII decimal 60) as &lt;
to avoid possible confusion with the beginning of a tag (start tag open
delimiter). The ampersand character "&" (ASCII decimal 38) should be escaped
as &amp; to avoid confusion with the beginning of an entity reference
(entity reference open delimiter).

You should also escape ampersand within attribute values since entity
references are allowed within CDATA attribute values. In addition, you
should escape ">" (ASCII decimal 62) as &gt; to avoid problems with older
user agents that incorrectly perceive this as the end of a tag (tag close
delimiter) when coming across this character in quoted attribute values.

Rather than worry about rules for quoting attribute values, its often easier
to encode any instance of " by &quot; and to always use " for quoting
attribute values. Many people find it simpler to always escape these four
characters in element content and attribute values:

   * "&amp;" to represent the & sign.
   * "&lt;" to represent the < sign.
   * "&gt;" to represent the > sign.
   * "&quot; to represent the " mark.

Names of named character entities are case-sensitive. Thus, &Aring; refers
to a different character (upper case A, ring) than &aring; (lower case a,
ring).

Note: In SGML, it is possible to eliminate the final ";" after a numeric or
named character reference in some cases (e.g., at a line break or directly
before a tag). In other circumstances it may not be eliminated (e.g., in the
middle of a word). We strongly suggest using the ";" in all cases to avoid
problems with user agents that require this character to be present.

                           7 Basic HTML data types

Contents

  1. URLs
  2. Character data
  3. Colors
       1. Notes on using colors
  4. Lengths and Pixels

This section of the specification describes the basic data types that may
appear as an element's content or an attribute's value.

7.1 URLs

The type "url" (%URL in the DTD) refers to either an absolute or relative
Uniform Resource Locator. Please consult the section on URLs for more
details.

7.2 Character data

The syntax of valid character data in HTML is defined in terms of the SGML
concepts of NAME and CDATA. For more introductory information about SGML,
please consult the SGML tutorial. For more information about SGML, please
consult the SGML handbook ([GOLD90]).

   * NAME. SGML name tokens must begin with a letter (A-Z and a-z) and may
     be followed by any number of letters, digits, hyphens ("-") and periods
     (".").
   * CDATA. For attribute values, this refers to a sequence of characters
     from the document character set, which may include character entities.
     User agents should resolve CDATA before further processing of attribute
     values. The HTML 4.0 specification often places further constraints on
     the permitted syntax for CDATA attributes.

     Although the STYLE and SCRIPT elements use CDATA for their data model,
     for these elements, CDATA must be handled differently by user agents.
     Markup and entities must be treated as raw text and passed to the
     application as is. The first occurrence of the character sequence "</"
     (end-tag open delimiter) is treated as terminating the end of the
     element's content. In valid documents, this would be the end tag for
     the element.

7.3 Colors

The attribute value type "color" (%Color) refers to color definitions as
specified in [SRGB]. A color value may either be a hexadecimal number
(prefixed by a hash mark) or one of the following sixteen color names:

                         Color names and sRGB values

             Black = "#000000"              Green = "#008000"

             Silver = "#C0C0C0"             Lime = "#00FF00"

             Gray = "#808080"               Olive = "#808000"

             White = "#FFFFFF"              Yellow = "#FFFF00"

             Maroon = "#800000"             Navy = "#000080"

             Red = "#FF0000"                Blue = "#0000FF"

             Purple = "#800080"             Teal = "#008080"

             Fuchsia = "#FF00FF"            Aqua = "#00FFFF"

Thus, the color values "#800080" and "Purple" both refer to the color
purple.

7.3.1 Notes on using colors

Although colors can add significant amounts of information to document and
make them more readable, please consider the following guidelines when
including color in your documents:

   * The use of HTML elements and attributes for specifying color is
     deprecated. You are encouraged to use style sheets instead.
   * Don't use color combinations that cause problems for people with color
     blindness in its various forms.
   * If you use a background image or set the background color, then be sure
     to set the various text colors as well.
   * Colors specified with the BODY and FONT elements and bgcolor on tables
     look different on different platforms (e.g., workstations, Macs,
     Windows, and LCD panels vs. CRTs), so you shouldn't rely entirely on a
     specific effect. In the future, support for the [SRGB] color model
     together with ICC color profiles should mitigate this problem.
   * When practical, adopt common conventions to minimize user confusion.
     Unless, of course, your desired effect is to confuse users!

7.4 Lengths and Pixels

Values of the type "length" may either be specified as an integer
representing the number of pixels of the canvas (screen, paper) or as a
percentage of the available horizontal or vertical space. In the DTD,
%Length refers to length values that may be percentages or pixels and
%Pixels refers to values that may only be pixels.

Thus, the value "50" means fifty pixels. For widths, the value "50%" means
half of the available horizontal space (between margins, within a table
cell, etc.). For heights, the value "50%" means half of the available
vertical space (in the current window, the current table cell, etc.).

For normative information about the definition of a pixel, please consult
[CSS1].

                 8 The global structure of an HTML document

Contents

  1. HTML version information
  2. The HTML element
  3. The HEAD element
       1. Titles: the TITLE element and the title attribute
       2. Meta information
  4. The BODY element
       1. Element identifiers: the id and class attributes
       2. Grouping elements: the DIV and SPAN elements
       3. Headings: The H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6 elements
       4. The ADDRESS element

An HTML 4.0 document generally consists of three parts: a line containing
version information, a descriptive header section, and a body, which
contains the document's actual content.

8.1 HTML version information

The first line of an HTML 4.0 document should be the document type
declaration. This includes an identifier string naming the DTD used by the
document (see [GOLD90]). We recommend that authors use one of the following
declarations:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN">

     For documents following the strict HTML 4.0 DTD, which excludes
     presentation attributes and elements that W3C expects to phase out as
     support for style sheets matures. If you need these features please use
     the transitional DTD.

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">

     For documents following the HTML 4.0 "transitional" DTD, which includes
     presentation attributes and elements that W3C expects to phase out as
     support for style sheets matures.

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Frameset//EN">

     For documents conforming to the HTML 4.0 frameset DTD, where a FRAMESET
     element replaces the BODY element.

The binding between public identifiers and files can be specified using a
catalog file following the format recommended by the SGML Open Consortium
(see [SGMLOPEN]). A sample catalog file for HTML 4.0 is included at the
beginning of the section on SGML reference information for HTML. The last
two letters of the declaration indicate the language of the DTD. For HTML,
this is always English ("EN"). User agents may ignore this information.

Some user agents also support the use of a URL in a system identifier, where
the URL references the DTD, as in:

<!DOCTYPE HTML SYSTEM "http://www.w3.org/DTD/HTML4/strict.dtd">

or better still together with the public identifier as in:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/DTD/HTML4-strict.dtd">

The user agent is then able to download the DTD and entity sets as needed.
The following URLs are supported in relation to this specification:

   * "http://www.w3.org/DTD/HTML4-strict.dtd" -- default strict DTD
   * "http://www.w3.org/DTD/HTML4-loose.dtd" -- loose DTD
   * "http://www.w3.org/DTD/HTML4-frameset.dtd" -- DTD for frameset
     documents
   * "http://www.w3.org/DTD/ISOlat1.ent" -- Latin-1 entities
   * "http://www.w3.org/DTD/HTMLsymbol.ent" -- Symbol entities
   * "http://www.w3.org/DTD/HTMLspecial.ent" -- Special entities

Notes:

  1. The HTML 3.2 specification proposed the use of the terms "Draft" or
     "Final" in the public identifier to distinguish between the draft and
     final recommendation. Experience suggests that these terms were
     ineffective so they are not being proposed for HTML 4.0.
  2. We recommend that authors avoid using the DTD subset due to the lack of
     widespread support for this feature.

8.2 The HTML element

<!ENTITY % version "version CDATA #FIXED '%HTML.Version;'">

<![ %HTML.Frameset; [
<!ENTITY % html.content "HEAD, FRAMESET">
]]>

<!ENTITY % html.content "HEAD, BODY">

<!ELEMENT HTML O O (%html.content;) -- document root element -->
<!ATTLIST HTML
  %version;
  %i18n;                           -- lang, dir --
  >

Start tag: optional, End tag: optional

Attribute definitions

version = url
     This attribute specifies (with a URL) the location of the DTD for the
     version of HTML governing the current document. Since the same
     information must appear in the DOCTYPE header, the usefulness of this
     attribute is uncertain.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)

After version information, the remainder of an HTML document is contained by
the HTML element. Thus, a typical HTML document has this structure:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN">
<HTML>
...The head, body, etc. goes here...
</HTML>

8.3 The HEAD element

<!-- %head.misc; defined earlier on as "SCRIPT | STYLE | META | LINK" -->
<!ENTITY % head.content "TITLE & ISINDEX? & BASE?">

<!ELEMENT HEAD O O  (%head.content;) +(%head.misc;) -- document head -->
<!ATTLIST HEAD
  %i18n;                           -- lang, dir --
  profile     %URL;      #IMPLIED  -- named dictionary of meta info --
  >

Start tag: optional, End tag: optional

Attribute definitions

profile = url
     This attribute specifies the location of one or more meta data
     profiles, separated by white space. For future extensions, user agents
     should consider the value to be a list even though this specification
     only considers the first URL to be significant. Profiles are discussed
     below in the section on meta information.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)

The HEAD element contains information about the current document, such as
its title, keywords that may be useful to search engines, and other data
that is not considered document content. Elements within the HEAD
declaration must not be rendered by conforming user agents unless otherwise
specified.

8.3.1 Titles: the TITLE element and the title attribute

<!-- The TITLE element is not considered part of the flow of text.
       It should be displayed, for example as the page header or
       window title. Exactly one title is required per document.
    -->
<!ELEMENT TITLE - -  (#PCDATA) -(%head.misc;) -- document title -->
<!ATTLIST TITLE %i18n>

Start tag: required, End tag: required

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)

Every HTML document must have exactly one TITLE element in the HEAD section.
User agents generally use the title to give people some idea about the
document's contents, for example, by displaying the title as a caption, or
speaking it.

For reasons of accessibility, user agents must always make the value of the
TITLE element available to users (including TITLE elements that occur in
frames). The mechanism for doing so depends on the user agent.

Titles may contain character entities (for accented characters, special
characters, etc.), but may not contain other markup. Here is a sample
document title:

<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>A study of population dynamics</TITLE>
... other head elements...
</HEAD>
<BODY>
... document body...
</BODY>
</HTML>

Related to the TITLE element is the title attribute.

Attribute definitions

title = cdata
     This attribute offers advisory information about the element for which
     it is set.

Unlike the TITLE element, which provides information about an entire
document and may only appear once, the title attribute may annotate any
number of elements. Please consult an element's definition to verify that it
supports this attribute. Values of the title attribute may be rendered by
user agents in a variety of ways. For instance, visual browsers frequently
display the title as a "tool tip" (a short message that appears when the
pointing device pauses over an object). Audio user agents may speak the
title information in a similar context. For example, setting the attribute
on a link allows user agents (visual and non-visual) to tell users about the
nature of the linked resource:

...some text...
Here's a photo of
<A href="http://someplace.com/neatstuff.gif" title="Me scuba diving">
   me scuba diving last summer
</A>
...some more text...

The title attribute has an additional role when used with the LINK element
to designate an external style sheet. Please consult the section on links
and style sheets for details.

Note: To improve the quality of speech synthesis for cases handled poorly by
standard techniques, future versions of HTML may include an attribute for
encoding phonemic and prosodic information.

8.3.2 Meta information

As this specification is being written, a number of approaches are being
proposed for allowing authors to assign richer machine-readable information
about documents and other network-accessible resources to an HTML document.

The current HTML specification allows authors to assign meta data to their
documents as follows:

   * Authors may cite an external profile where meta data properties are
     defined. For example, a profile might define properties that help
     search engines index documents, such as "author", "copyright",
     "keywords", etc. A profile is specified via the profile attribute of
     the HEAD element.
   * Authors may set values for these properties. This may be done:
       1. From within a document, via the META element. Thus, the profile
          may define the name space of properties that can be set by the
          META element.
       2. From outside a document, by linking to meta data via the LINK
          element (see the section on link types). Thus, the profile may
          define the name space of relationship types that may be used by
          the LINK element.

Note that since a profile is defined for the HEAD element, the same profile
applies to all META and LINK elements in the document head.

The META element

<!ELEMENT META - O EMPTY        -- generic metainformation -->
<!ATTLIST META
  %i18n;                           -- lang, dir, for use with content string --
  http-equiv  NAME       #IMPLIED  -- HTTP response header name  --
  name        NAME       #IMPLIED  -- metainformation name --
  content     CDATA      #REQUIRED -- associated information --
  scheme      CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- select form of content --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: forbidden

Attribute definitions

For the following attributes, the permitted values and their interpretation
are profile dependent:

name = cdata
     This attribute specifies a property name.
content = cdata
     This attribute specifies a property's value.
scheme = cdata
     This attribute names a scheme to be used to interpret the property's
     value.
http-equiv = cdata
     This attribute may be used in place of the name attribute. HTTP servers
     use this attribute to gather information for HTTP response message
     headers.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)

The META element can be used to describe properties of a document (e.g.,
author, expiration date, a list of key words, etc.) and assign values to
those properties. This specification does not define a normative set of
properties.

The name attribute specifies a property and the content attribute specifies
the property's value. For example, the following declaration sets a value
for the Author property:

<META name="Author" content="Dave Raggett">

The lang attribute can be used with META to specify the language for the
value of the content attribute. This enables speech synthesizers to apply
language dependent pronunciation rules.

In this example, the author's name is declared to be French:

<META name="Author" lang="fr" content="Arnaud Le Hors">

Here's another example that illustrates how some user agents support the use
of META to refresh the current page after a few seconds, perhaps replacing
it with another page:

<META name="refresh" content="3,http://www.acme.com/intro.html">

The content is a number specifying the delay in seconds, followed by the URL
to load when the time is up. This mechanism is generally used to show users
a fleeting introductory page. However, since some user agents do not support
this mechanism, authors should include content on the introductory page to
allow users to navigate away from it (so they don't remain "stranded" on the
introductory page).

META and HTTP headers

The http-equiv attribute can be used in place of the name attribute and has
a special significance when documents are retrieved via the Hypertext
Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP servers may use the property name specified
by the http-equiv attribute to create an [RFC822]-style header in the HTTP
response. Please see the HTTP specification ([RFC2068]) for details on valid
HTTP headers.

The following sample META declaration:

<META http-equiv="Expires" content="Tue, 20 Aug 1996 14:25:27 GMT">

will result in the HTTP header:

Expires: Tue, 20 Aug 1996 14:25:27 GMT

This can be used by caches to determine when to fetch a fresh copy of the
associated document.

META and search engines

A common use for META is to specify keywords that a search engine may use to
improve the quality of search results. When several META elements provide
language-dependent information about a document, search engines may filter
on the lang attribute to display search results using the language
preferences of the user. For example,

<META name="keywords" lang="en"
         content="vacation,Greece,sunshine">
<META name="keywords" lang="fr"
         content="vacances,Gr&egrave;ce,soleil">

The effectiveness of search engines can also be increased by using the LINK
element to specify links to translations of the document in other languages,
links to versions of the document in other media (e.g., PDF), and, when the
document is part of a collection, links to an appropriate starting point for
browsing the collection.

META and PICS

The Platform for Internet Content Selection [PICS] is an infrastructure for
associating labels (meta data) with Internet content. Originally designed to
help parents and teachers control what children can access on the Internet,
it also facilitates other uses for labels, including code signing, privacy,
and intellectual property rights management.

This example illustrates how one can use a META declaration to include a
PICS 1.1 label:

<HEAD>
 <META http-equiv="PICS-Label" content='
 (PICS-1.1 "http://www.gcf.org/v2.5"
    labels on "1994.11.05T08:15-0500"
      until "1995.12.31T23:59-0000"
      for "http://w3.org/PICS/Overview.html"
    ratings (suds 0.5 density 0 color/hue 1))
 '>
</HEAD>

META and default information

The META element may be used to specify the default information for a
document in the following instances:

   * The default scripting language.
   * The default style sheet language.
   * The document character encoding.

The following example specifies the character encoding for a document as
being ISO-8859-5

<META http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-5">

Meta data profiles

The profile attribute of the HEAD specifies the location of a meta data
profile. The value of the profile attribute is a URL. User agents may use
this URL in two ways:

   * As a globally unique name. User agents may be able to recognize the
     name (without actually retrieving the profile) and perform some
     activity based on known conventions for that profile. For instance,
     search engines could provide an interface for searching through
     catalogs of HTML documents, where these documents all use the same
     profile for representing catalog entries.
   * As a link. User agents may dereference the URL and, perform some
     activity based on the actual definitions within the profile (e.g.,
     validate the usage of the profile within the current HTML document).
     This specification does not define formats for profiles.

This example refers to a hypothetical profile that defines useful properties
for document indexing. The properties defined by this profile --- including
"author", "copyright", "keywords", and "date" --- have their values set by
subsequent META declarations.

 <HEAD profile="http://www.acme.com/profiles/core">
  <TITLE>How to complete Memorandum cover sheets</TITLE>
  <META name="author" content="John Doe">
  <META name="copyright" content="&copy; 1997 Acme Corp.">
  <META name="keywords" content="corporate,guidelines,cataloging">
  <META name="date" content="1994-11-06T08:49:37+00:00">
 </HEAD>

As this specification is being written, it is common practice to use the
date formats described in [RFC2068]. As these formats are relatively hard to
process, we recommend that authors use the [ISO8601] date format. For more
information, see the sections on the INS and DEL elements.

The scheme attribute is used to identify the expected format of the value of
the content attribute, for cases when a property supports multiple formats.
The values permitted for the scheme attribute depend on the property name
and the profile.

The first META declaration in the following example refers to the Dewey
Decimal System (dds) scheme. The second refers to the ISBN scheme.

<META scheme="dds" name="description"
         content="04.251 Supercomputers systems design">
<META scheme="ISBN"  name="identifier" content="0-8230-2355-9">

Note: One sample profile is the Dublin Core[DCORE]. This profile defines a
set of recommended properties for electronic bibliographic descriptions, and
is intended to promote interoperability among disparate description models.

8.4 The BODY element

<!ENTITY % block "%blocklevel; | %inline;">

<!ENTITY % Color "CDATA" -- a color using sRGB: #RRGGBB as Hex values -->

<!-- There are also 16 widely known color names with their sRGB values:

  onunload    %Script;   #IMPLIED  -- the document has been removed --
  >

Start tag: optional, End tag: optional

Attribute definitions

background = url
     Deprecated.The value of this attribute is a URL that designates an
     image resource. The image generally tiles the background (for visual
     browsers).
text =color
     Deprecated.This attribute sets the foreground color for text (for
     visual browsers).
link = color
     Deprecated.This attribute sets the color of text marking unvisited
     hypertext links (for visual browsers).
vlink = color
     Deprecated.This attribute sets the color of text marking visited
     hypertext links (for visual browsers).
alink = color
     Deprecated.This attribute sets the color of text marking hypertext
     links when selected by the user (for visual browsers).

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information)
   * bgcolor (background color)
   * onload, onunload (intrinsic events)
   * onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove,
     onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup (intrinsic events)

The body of a document contains the document's content. The content may be
presented by a user agent in a variety of ways. For example, for visual
browsers, you can think of the body as a canvas where the content appears:
text, images, colors, graphics, etc. For audio user agents, the same content
may be spoken. Since style sheets are now the preferred way to specify a
document's presentation, the presentational attributes of BODY have been
deprecated.

The following line of HTML illustrates the use of the deprecated attributes.
It sets the background color of the canvas to white, the text foreground
color to black, and the color of hyperlinks to red initially, fuchsia when
activated, and maroon once visited.

DEPRECATED EXAMPLE:

<HTML>
<HEAD>
 <TITLE>A study of population dynamics</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="white" text="black"
  link="red" alink="fuchsia" vlink="maroon">
  ... document body...
</BODY>
</HTML>

Using style sheets, the same effect could be accomplished as follows:

<HTML>
<HEAD>
 <TITLE>A study of population dynamics</TITLE>
 <STYLE type="text/css">
  BODY { background: white; color: black}
  A:link { color: red }
  A:visited { color: maroon }
  A:active { color: fuchsia }
 </STYLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
  ... document body...
</BODY>
</HTML>

Using external (linked) style sheets gives you the flexibility to change the
presentation without revising the source HTML document:

<HTML>
<HEAD>
 <TITLE>A study of population dynamics</TITLE>
 <LINK rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="smartstyle.css">
</HEAD>
<BODY>
  ... document body...
</BODY>
</HTML>

Framesets and HTML bodies. Documents that contain framesets replace the BODY
element by the FRAMESET element. Please consult the section on frames for
more information.

8.4.1 Element identifiers: the id and class attributes

Attribute definitions

id = name
     This attribute assigns a document-wide name to a specific instance of
     an element. Values for id must be unique within a document.
     Furthermore, this attribute shares the same name space as the name
     attribute.
class = cdata-list
     This attribute assigns a class or set of classes to a specific instance
     of an element. Any number of elements may be assigned the same class
     name or names. They must be separated by white space characters.

The id and class attributes assign identifiers to an element instance.

An identifier specified by id must be unique within a document. A class name
specified by class may be shared by several element instances. Class values
should be chosen to distinguish the role of the element the class is
associated with, e.g., note, example, warning.

These attributes can be used in the following ways:

   * The id attribute may be used as a destination for hypertext links (see
     the section on anchors).
   * Scripts can use the id attribute to reference a particular element.
   * Style sheets can use the id attribute to apply a style to a particular
     element.
   * The id attribute is used to identify OBJECT element declarations.
   * Style sheets can use the class attribute to apply a style to a set of
     elements associated with this class, or to elements that occur as the
     children of such elements.
   * Both id and class can be used for further processing purposes, e.g. for
     identifying fields when extracting data from HTML pages into a
     database, translating HTML documents into other formats, etc.).

Almost every HTML element may be assigned identifier and class information.

Suppose, for example, that we are writing a document about a programming
language. The document is to include a number of preformatted examples. We
use the PRE element to format the examples. We also assign a background
color (green) to all instances of the PRE element belonging to the class
"example".

<HEAD>
<STYLE
PRE.example { background : green }
</STYLE
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<PRE class="example" id="example-1">
...example code here...
</PRE>
</BODY>

By setting the id attribute for this example, we can (1) create a hyperlink
to it and (2) override class style information with instance style
information.

8.4.2 Grouping elements: the DIV and SPAN elements

<!ELEMENT DIV - - (%block;)+ -- generic language/style container -->
<!ATTLIST DIV
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  %align;                          -- align, text alignment --
  >
<!ELEMENT SPAN - - (%inline;)*      -- generic language/style container -->
<!ATTLIST SPAN
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information)
   * align (alignment)
   * onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove,
     onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup (intrinsic events)

The DIV and SPAN elements, in conjunction with the id and class attributes,
offer a generic mechanism for adding structure to documents. These are the
only two HTML elements that do not add presentation to their enclosed
content. Thus, by creating instances and classes of elements and applying
style sheets to them, authors may specialize HTML according to their needs
and tastes.

Suppose we wanted to generate a document from a database of client
information. Since HTML does not include elements that identify objects such
as "client", "telephone number", "email address", etc., we use DIV and SPAN
to tailor HTML to our own needs.

In this example, every client's last name belongs to the class
"client-last-name", etc. We also assign a unique identifier to each client
("client-boyera", "client-lafon", etc.).

<DIV id="client-boyera" class="client">
Last name: <SPAN class="client-last-name">Boyera</SPAN>,
First name: <SPAN class="client-first-name">Stephane</SPAN>,
Tel: <SPAN class="client-tel">(212) 555-1212</SPAN>,
Email: <SPAN class="client-email">sb@foo.org:</SPAN>,
</DIV>

<DIV id="client-lafon" class="client">
Last name: <SPAN class="client-last-name">Lafon</SPAN>,
First name: <SPAN class="client-first-name">Yves</SPAN>,
Tel: <SPAN class="client-tel">(671) 555-1212</SPAN>,
Email: <SPAN class="client-email">yves@bar.com:</SPAN>,
</DIV>

Later, we may easily add style sheet declaration to fine tune the
presentation of these database entries.

SPAN is an inline element and can be used within paragraphs, list items,
etc. when you want assign class or language information to a group of words.
SPAN cannot be used to group block-level elements. SPAN has no inherent
effect on rendering until you apply a style, e.g., via a style attribute, or
a linked style sheet.

DIV by contrast, is a block-level element. It can be used to group other
block-level elements, but can't be used within paragraph elements. A DIV
element following an unclosed P element will terminate that paragraph.

User agents generally place a line break before and after DIV elements, for
instance:

<P>aaaaaaaaa<DIV>bbbbbbbbb</DIV><DIV>ccccc<P>ccccc</DIV>

This is typically rendered as:

aaaaaaaaa
bbbbbbbbb
ccccc

ccccc

Your user agent renders this as follows:

aaaaaaaaa
bbbbbbbbb
ccccc

ccccc

8.4.3 Headings: The H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6 elements

<!ENTITY % heading "H1|H2|H3|H4|H5|H6">
<!--
  There are six levels of headings from H1 (the most important)
  to H6 (the least important).
-->

<!ELEMENT (%heading;)  - -  (%inline;)* -- heading -->
<!ATTLIST (%heading;)
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  %align;                          -- align, text alignment --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information)
   * align (alignment)
   * onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove,
     onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup (intrinsic events)

A heading element briefly describes the topic of the section it introduces.
Heading information may be used by user agents, for example, to construct a
table of contents for a document automatically.

There are six levels of headings in HTML with H1 as the most important and
H6 as the least. Visual browsers usually render more important headings in
larger fonts than less important ones.

The following example shows how to use the DIV element to associate a
heading with the document section that follows it. Doing so allows you to
define a style for the section (color the background, set the font, etc.)
with style sheets.

<DIV class="section" id="forest-elephants" >
<H1>Forest elephants</H1>
In this section, we discuss the lesser known forest elephants.
...this section continues...
<DIV class="subsection" id="forest-habitat" >
<H2>Habitat</H2>
Forest elephants do not live in trees but among them.
...this subsection continues...
</DIV>
</DIV>

This structure may be decorated with style information such as:

<HEAD>
<STYLE>
DIV.section { text-align: justify; font-size: 12pt}
DIV.subsection { text-indent: 2em }
H1 { font-style: italic; color: green }
H2 { color: green }
</STYLE>
</HEAD>

Numbered sections and references
HTML does not itself cause section numbers to be generated from headings.
This facility may be offered by user agents, however. Soon, style sheet
languages such as CSS will allow authors to control the generation of
section numbers (handy for forward references in printed documents, as in
"See section 7.2").

Some people consider skipping heading levels to be bad practice. They accept
H1 H2 H1 while they do not accept H1 H3 H1 since the heading level H2 is
skipped.

8.4.4 The ADDRESS element

<!ELEMENT ADDRESS - - ((%inline;) | P)+ -- information on author -->
<!ATTLIST ADDRESS
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove,
     onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup (intrinsic events)

For lack of a better place, we include the definition of the ADDRESS here.
This element adds author and contact information to a document, e.g.,

<ADDRESS>
Newsletter editor<BR>
J. R. Brown<BR>
8723 Buena Vista, Smallville, CT 01234<BR>
Tel: +1 (123) 456 7890

This section of the document discusses two important issues that affect the
internationalization of HTML: specifying the language (the lang attribute)
and direction (the dir attribute) of text in a document.

9.1 Specifying the language of content: the lang attribute

Attribute definitions

lang = language-code
     Specifies the base language of an element's attribute values or text
     content. The value of this attribute is a language code as specified by
     [RFC1766]. Please consult this document for authoritative information
     on language codes. Whitespace is not allowed within the language-code.
     All language-codes are case-insensitive. The default language is
     "unknown".

Language information can be used to control rendering of a marked up
document in a variety of ways. Some situations where this information helps
include:

   * Assisting search engines
   * Speech synthesis
   * Selecting glyph variants for high quality typography
   * Choosing a set of quotation marks
   * Resolving hyphenation ligatures, and spacing
   * Spell checking and grammar checking

The lang attribute's value is a language code that identifies a natural
language spoken, written, or otherwise conveyed by human beings for
communication of information to other human beings. Computer languages are
explicitly excluded from language codes.

[RFC1766] defines and explains the language codes that must be used in HTML
documents.

Briefly, language codes consist of a primary code and a possibly empty
series of subcodes:

        language-code  = primary-code *( "-" subcode )

Here are some sample language codes:

   * "en": English
   * "en-US": the U.S. version of English.
   * "en-cockney": the Cockney version of English.
   * "i-cherokee": the Cherokee language spoken by some Native Americans.
   * "x-pig-latin": the language "pig-latin" has not been registered with
     IANA, the organization that controls the name-space of language tags.

Two-letter primary codes are reserved for [ISO639] language abbreviations.
Two-letter codes include fr (French), de (German), it (Italian), nl (Dutch),
el (Greek), es (Spanish), pt (Portuguese), ar (Arabic), he (Hebrew), ru
(Russian), zh (Chinese), ja (Japanese), hi (Hindi), ur (Urdu), and sa
(Sanskrit).

Any two-letter subcode is understood to be a [ISO3166] country code.

9.1.1 Inheritance of language codes

An element inherits language code information according to the following
order of precedence (highest to lowest):

   * The lang attribute set for the element itself.
   * The closest parent element that has the lang attribute set (i.e., the
     lang attribute is inherited).
   * The HTTP "Content-Language" header (which may be configured in a
     server). For example:

     Content-Language: en-cockney

   * Sources external to HTML (e.g., user agent default values, user
     preferences, HTTP headers).

In this example, the primary language of the document is French ("fr"). One
paragraph is declared to be in Spanish ("es"), after which the primary
language returns to French. The following paragraph includes an embedded
Japanese ("ja") phrase, after which the primary language returns to French.

<HTML lang="fr">
<BODY>
...Interpreted as French...
<P lang="es">...Interpreted as Spanish...
<P>...Interpreted as French again...
<P>...French text interrupted by<EM lang="ja">some
         Japanese</EM>French begins here again...
</BODY>
</HTML>

9.1.2 Interpretation of language codes

In the context of HTML, a language code should be interpreted by user agents
as a hierarchy of tokens rather than a single token. When a user agent
adjusts rendering according to language information (say, by comparing style
sheet language codes and lang values), it should always favor an exact
match, but should also consider matching primary codes to be sufficient.
Thus, if the lang attribute value of "en-US" is set for the HTML element, a
user agent should prefer style information that matches "en-US" first, then
the more general value "en".

Note: Language code hierarchies do not guarantee that all languages with a
common prefix will be understood by those fluent in one or more of those
languages. They do allow a user to request this commonality when it is true
for that user.

For artificial languages such as Elfish or Klingon, it would make sense to
use the lang attribute to indicate the change from the language of the
enclosing context. Until the successor to [RFC1766] defines a standard way
to do this, one possibility is to use the x- prefix convention, e.g.
x-elfish.

9.2 Specifying the direction of text: the dir attribute

Attribute definitions

dir = LTR | RTL
     Specifies the base direction to be assigned to neutral text surrounded
     by text of differing directions in the element's content (left-to-right
     or right-to-left) in this document. Possible values:
        o LTR: Left-to-right text.
        o RTL: Right-to-left text.

In addition to specifying the primary language of a document, authors may
need to specify the base direction of pieces of text or the text in the
entire document.

The [UNICODE] specification assigns directionality to Unicode characters and
defines a (complex) algorithm for determining the proper directionality of
text. If a document does not contain a displayable right-to-left character,
a conforming user agent is not required to apply the [UNICODE] bidirectional
algorithm. If a document contains right-to-left characters, and if the user
agent displays these characters, the user agent must use the bidirectional
algorithm.

Although Unicode specifies special characters that deal with text direction,
HTML offers higher-level markup constructs that do the same thing: the dir
attribute (do not confuse with the DIR element) and the BDO element. Thus,
to express a Hebrew quotation, it is more intuitive to write

<Q lang="he" dir="rtl">...a Hebrew quotation...</Q>

than the equivalent with Unicode references:

&#x202B;&#x05F4;...a Hebrew quotation...&#x05F4;&#x202C;

User agents must not use the lang attribute to determine text
directionality.

In the absence of local overrides, the base direction is inherited from
enclosing elements.

9.2.1 Introduction to the bidirectional algorithm

The following example illustrates the expected behavior of the bidirectional
algorithm.

Consider the following example text:

  english1 HEBREW2 english3 HEBREW4 english5 HEBREW6

The characters in this example (and in all related examples) are stored in
the computer the way they are displayed here: the first character in the
file is "e", the second is "n", and the last is "6".

Suppose the predominant language of the document containing this paragraph
is English. This means that the base direction is left to right. The correct
presentation of this line would be:

english1 2WERBEH english3 4WERBEH english5 6WERBEH
         -------          -------          -------
            H                H                H
--------------------------------------------------
                       E

The dotted lines indicate the structure of the sentence: English
predominates and some Hebrew text is embedded. Achieving the correct
presentation requires no additional markup since the Hebrew fragments are
reversed correctly by user agents applying the bidirectional algorithm.

If, on the other hand, the predominant language of the document is Hebrew,
the base direction is right to left. The correct presentation is therefore:

6WERBEH english5 4WERBEH english3 2WERBEH english1
        --------         --------         --------
            E                E                E
--------------------------------------------------
                       H

In this case, the whole sentence has been presented as right-to-left and the
embedded English sequences have been properly reversed by the bidirectional
algorithm.

9.2.2 Inheritance of text direction information

The Unicode bidirectional algorithm requires a base text direction. To
specify the base direction of a block-level element, set the element's dir
attribute. The default value of the dir attribute is "ltr" (left-to-right
text).

When the dir attribute is set for a block-level element, it remains in
effect for the duration of the element and any nested block-level elements.
Setting the dir attribute on a nested element overrides the inherited value.

To set the base text direction for an entire document, set the dir attribute
on the HTML element.

For example:

<HTML dir="RTL">
...right-to-left text...
<P dir="ltr">...left-to-right text...</P>
<P>...right-to-left text again...</P>
</HTML>

Inline elements, on the other hand, do not inherit the dir attribute. This
means that an inline element without a dir attribute does not open an
additional level of embedding with respect to the bidirectional algorithm.

9.2.3 Setting the direction of embedded text

The [UNICODE] bidirectional algorithm automatically reverses embedded
character sequences according to their inherent directionality (as
illustrated by the previous examples). However, in general only one level of
embedding can be accounted for. To achieve additional levels of embedded
direction changes, you must make use of the dir attribute on an inline
element.

Consider the same example text as before:

english1 HEBREW2 english3 HEBREW4 english5 HEBREW6

Suppose the predominant language of the document containing this paragraph
is English. Furthermore, the above English sentence contains a Hebrew
section extending from HEBREW2 through HEBREW4 and the Hebrew section
contains an English quotation (english3). The desired presentation of the
text is thus:

english1 4WERBEH english3 2WERBEH english5 6WERBEH
                 -------
                    E
         ------------------------
                    H
--------------------------------------------------
                    E

To achieve two embedded direction changes, we must supply additional
information, which we do by delimiting the second embedding explicitly. In
this example, we use the SPAN element and the dir attribute to mark up the
text:

english1 <SPAN dir="RTL">HEBREW2 english3 HEBREW4</SPAN> english5 HEBREW6

Authors may also use special Unicode characters to achieve multiply embedded
direction changes. To achieve left-to-right embedding, surround embedded
text with the characters LEFT-TO-RIGHT EMBEDDING ("LRE", hexadecimal 202A)
and POP DIRECTIONAL FORMATTING ("PDF", hexadecimal 202C). To achieve
right-to-left embedding, surround embedded text with the characters
RIGHT-TO-LEFT EMBEDDING ("RTE", hexadecimal 202B) and PDF.

Using HTML directionality markup with Unicode characters. Authors and
designers of authoring software should be aware that conflicts can arise if
the dir attribute is used on inline elements (including BDO) concurrently
with the corresponding [UNICODE] formatting characters. Preferably one or
the other should be used exclusively. The markup method offers a better
guarantee of document structural integrity and alleviates some problems when
editing bidirectional HTML text with a simple text editor, but some software
may be more apt at using the [UNICODE] characters. If both methods are used,
great care should be exercised to insure proper nesting of markup and
directional embedding or override, otherwise, rendering results are
undefined.

9.2.4 Overriding the bidirectional algorithm: the BDO element

<!ELEMENT BDO - - (%inline;)*       -- I18N BiDi over-ride -->
<!ATTLIST BDO
  %coreattrs;                      -- id, class, style, title --
  lang        NAME       #IMPLIED  -- [RFC1766] language value --
  dir         (ltr|rtl)  #REQUIRED -- directionality --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)

The bidirectional algorithm and the dir attribute generally suffice to
manage embedded direction changes. However, some situations may arise when
the bidirectional algorithm results in incorrect presentation. The BDO
element allows authors to turn off the bidirectional algorithm for selected
fragments of text.

Consider an English document containing the same text as before:

english1 HEBREW2 english3 HEBREW4 english5 HEBREW6

Suppose this sequence of characters is being read by a user agent from
left-to-right (the byte stream begins with "e" and ends with "6"). The "e"
in "english1" is to the left of "n", which is how authors tend to input
English characters. However, the "H" in "HEBREW2" is to the left of "E",
which may not be how authors of Hebrew create their documents. For example,
the MIME standard ([RFC2045]) requires right-to-left character sequences in
email to be ordered right-to-left in the byte stream. This conflicts with
the [UNICODE] bidirectional algorithm, which expects Hebrew characters to be
ordered left-to-right.

Thus, if "HEBREW4" in the above example were an excerpt from a Hebrew email
message, it's structure would actually be "4WERBEH". A user agent applying
the bidirectional algorithm would thus display the characters in the wrong
order.

The easiest solution in this case is to override the bidirectional algorithm
by putting the Hebrew email excerpt in a BDO element, whose dir attribute is
set to "LTR":

english1 HEBREW2 english3 <BDO dir="LTR">4WERBEH</BDO> english5 HEBREW6

This tells the bidirectional algorithm "Leave me left-to-right!" and would
produce the desired presentation:

english1 2WERBEH english3 4WERBEH english5 6WERBEH

The BDO should be used in scenarios where absolute control over sequence
order is required (e.g., multi-language part numbers). The dir attribute is
mandatory for this element.

Authors may also use special Unicode characters to override the
bidirectional algorithm --- LEFT-TO-RIGHT OVERRIDE (202D) or RIGHT-TO-LEFT
OVERRIDE (hexadecimal 202E). The POP DIRECTIONAL FORMATTING (hexadecimal
202C) character ends either bidirectional override.

Note: Recall that conflicts can arise if the dir attribute is used on inline
elements (including BDO) concurrently with the corresponding [UNICODE]
formatting characters.

Bidirectionality and character encoding According to [RFC1555] and
[RFC1556], there are special conventions for the use of "charset" parameter
values to indicate bidirectional treatment in MIME mail, in particular to
distinguish between visual, implicit, and explicit directionality. The
parameter value "iso-8859-8" (for Hebrew) denotes visual encoding,
"iso-8859-8-i" denotes implicit bidirectionality, and "iso-8859-8-e" denotes
explicit directionality.

Because HTML uses the full Unicode bidirectionality algorithm, conforming
documents must be labeled as "iso-8859-8-e". Implicit bidirectionality is
part of the full Unicode algorithm, so the values "iso-8859-8-i" may also be
accepted, but should not be used.

The value "iso-8859-8" defines that the document is formatted visually,
misusing some markup (such as TABLE with right alignment and no line
wrapping) to ensure reasonable display on older user agents that do not
handle bidirectionality. Such documents do not conform to the present
specification. If necessary, they can be made to conform to the current
specification (and at the same time will be displayed correctly on older
user agents) by adding BDO markup where necessary. Contrary to what is said
in [RFC1555] and [RFC1556], iso-8859-6 (Arabic) is not visual ordering.

9.2.5 Support for character directionality and joining

Since ambiguities sometimes arise as to the directionality of certain
characters (e.g., some situations in Arabic), the [UNICODE] specification
includes characters to enable proper resolution. HTML 4.0 includes a set of
named character entities that allows partial support of the Unicode
bidirectional algorithm, plus some help with languages requiring contextual
analysis for rendering.

The following DTD excerpt presents some of the directional entities:

   <!ENTITY zwnj CDATA "&#8204;"--=zero width non-joiner-->
   <!ENTITY zwj  CDATA "&#8205;"--=zero width joiner-->
   <!ENTITY lrm  CDATA "&#8206;"--=left-to-right mark-->
   <!ENTITY rlm  CDATA "&#8207;"--=right-to-left mark-->

The zwnj entity is used to block joining behavior in contexts where joining
will occur but shouldn't. The zwj entity does the opposite; it forces
joining when it wouldn't occur but should. For example, the Arabic letter
"HEH" is used to abbreviate "Hijri", the name of the Islamic calendar
system. Since the isolated form of "HEH" looks like the digit five as
employed in Arabic script (based on Indic digits), in order to prevent
confusing "HEH" as a final digit five in a year, the base form of "HEH" is
used. However, there is no following context (i.e., a joining letter) to
which the "HEH" can join. The zwj character provides that context.

Similarly, in Persian texts, there are cases where a letter that normally
would join a subsequent letter in a cursive connection should not. The
character zwnj is used to block joining in such cases.

The other characters, lrm and rlm, are used to force directionality of
directionally neutral characters. For example, if a double quotation mark
comes between an Arabic and a Latin letter, the direction of the quotation
mark is not clear (is it quoting the Arabic text or the Latin text?). The
lrm and rlm characters have a directional property but no width and no
word/line break property. Please consult [UNICODE] for more details.

Reversed character glyphs: The bidirectional algorithm reverses the
presentation of a well-defined set of characters such as parentheses (see
[UNICODE], table 4-7). Except for these characters, bidirectionality
processing leaves the shape of each glyph unaffected. Thus, if you wanted to
display the word "MURDER" as it would be seen in a mirror (right-to-left
character order and reversed glyphs), you could use a BDO element with the
dir attribute to set the text direction to right-to-left order, e.g.,

<BDO class="mirror" dir="rtl">MURDER</BDO>

and the class value "mirror" with a matching rule in the style sheet to
select a special font that displays characters with the reversed glyphs.

9.2.6 The effect of style sheets on bidirectionality

In general, changing an element from being displayed in block form to inline
or vice-versa due to a style sheet is straightforward. However, because the
difference between block elements and inline elements is crucial for the
bidirectional algorithm, special care must be taken.

When an inline element that does not have a dir attribute is transformed to
a block element by a style sheet, it inherits the dir attribute from its
closest parent block element to define the base direction of the block.

When a block element that does not have a dir attribute is transformed to an
inline element by a style sheet, the resulting presentation should be
equivalent, in terms of bidirectional formatting, to the formatting obtained
by explicitly adding a dir attribute (assigned the inherited value) to the
transformed element.

9.2.7 Undisplayable characters

User agents may not be able to render meaningfully all character values, for
instance, because of the lack of an appropriate font, or because a character
has a value which is inexpressible with the internal character encoding.

Because there are many different (including language-dependent) ways to
handle such cases, this specification does not prescribe any specific
behavior. Depending on the implementation, this may also be handled by the
underlying display system and not the application itself. This specification
recommends the following behavior for user agents:

  1. Adopt a clearly visible, but unobtrusive mechanism to alert the user of
     missing resources.
  2. If the user agent provides a numeric representation of missing
     characters, the hexadecimal (not decimal) form is preferable as this is
     the form used in character set standards.

The following sections discuss issues surrounding the structuring of text.
Elements that format text (alignment elements, font elements, style sheets,
etc.) are discussed in later sections of the specification. Please consult
the section on SGML for information concerning character syntax.

10.1 White space

The SGML specification distinguishes between record start characters (line
feeds) and record end characters (carriage returns). On the Internet, some
platforms use carriage return/line feed pairs for line breaks, some use just
line feeds, and others just carriage returns. As a result, HTML user agents
should consider single carriage returns, single line feeds, and carriage
return/line feed pairs to be a single line break. Throughout this
specification, the term "line break" will refer to a single line break
produced by any combination of carriage returns and line feeds.

A line break occurring immediately following a start tag must be ignored, as
must a line break occurring immediately before an end tag. This applies to
all HTML elements without exceptions. In addition, for all elements except
PRE, leading white space characters, such as spaces, horizontal tabs, form
feeds and line breaks, following the start tag must be ignored, and any
subsequent sequence of contiguous white space characters must be replaced by
a single word space.

The following three examples must be rendered identically:

<P>Thomas is watching TV.</P>

<P>
Thomas is watching TV.
</P>

<P>
  Thomas is watching TV.
</P>

Since the notion of what word space is varies from script (written language)
to script, user agents should collapse white space in script-sensitive ways.
For example, in Latin scripts, a single word space is just a space (ASCII
decimal 32), while in Thai it is a zero-width word separator. In Japanese
and Chinese, a word space is ignored entirely.

These rules allow authors to use white space to lay out their markup as
desired, clarifying the source HTML with white space that will not be
rendered by a user agent.

For instance, the following source HTML:

<P>
  This example shows a paragraph and a list.
</P>

<UL>
  <LI>
    This is the <EM>first</EM> item
  </LI>

  <LI>
    This is the <EM>second</EM> item
  </LI>
</UL>

may be "rewritten" by omitting end tags and using less white space:

<P>This example shows a paragraph and a list.

<UL>
  <LI>This is the <EM>first</EM> item
  <LI>This is the <EM>second</EM> item
</UL>

but should be rendered identically by a user agent.

The PRE element is used for preformatted text, where white space is
significant. The PRE element is described below.

Word space processing can and should be done even in the absence of language
information specified by the lang attribute.

10.2 Structured text

10.2.1 Phrasal elements: EM, STRONG, DFN, CODE, SAMP, KBD, VAR, CITE, and
ACRONYM

<!ENTITY % phrase "EM | STRONG | DFN | CODE |
                   SAMP | KBD | VAR | CITE | ACRONYM">
<!ELEMENT (%fontstyle;|%phrase;) - - (%inline;)*>
<!ATTLIST (%fontstyle;|%phrase;)
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information )
   * onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove,
     onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup (intrinsic events )

Phrasal elements add structural information to text fragments. The usual
meanings of phrasal elements are following:

EM:
     Indicates emphasis.
STRONG:
     Indicates stronger emphasis.
CITE:
     Cites a reference or other source.
DFN:
     Indicates that this is the defining instance of the enclosed term.
CODE:
     Designates a fragment of computer code.
SAMP:
     Designates sample output from programs, scripts, etc.
KBD:
     Indicates text to be entered by the user.
VAR:
     Indicates an instance of a variable or program argument.
ACRONYM:
     Indicates an acronym (e.g., WWW, HTTP, URL, etc.).

EM and STRONG are useful in general to indicate emphasis. The other phrasal
elements have particular significance in technical documents. These examples
illustrate the rendering of some of the textual markup elements:

"More information can be found in <CITE>[ISO-0000]</CITE>."

"Please refer to the following reference number in future
correspondence: <STRONG>1-234-55</STRONG>"

The presentation of phrasal elements depends on the user agent. Generally,
visual user agents present EM text in italics and STRONG text in bold font.
Speech synthesizer agents may change the synthesis parameters, such as
volume, pitch and rate accordingly.

The ACRONYM element allows authors to clearly indicate a sequence of
characters that compose an acronym (e.g., "NATA", "WWW", "FNAC", "IRS",
etc.). The ability to identify acronyms is useful to spell checkers, speech
synthesizers, and other user agents and tools.

The content of the ACRONYM element specifies the acronym itself. The title
attribute may be used to provide the text to which the acronym expands. Here
are some sample acronym definitions:

<ACRONYM title="World Wide Web">WWW</ACRONYM>
<ACRONYM
   lang="fr"
   title="Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Nationale de Chemins de Fer">
   SNCF
</ACRONYM>

Note that some acronyms are pronounced letter-by-letter (such as "IRS" or
"BBC"); others are pronounced as words (such as "NATO" or "UNESCO"; still
others are spelled out by some people and pronounced as words by other
people ("URL", "SQL"). Authors should use style sheets to specify how a
specific acronym is to be pronounced.

10.2.2 Quotations: The BLOCKQUOTE and Q elements

<!ELEMENT BLOCKQUOTE - - (%block;)+ -- long quotation -->
<!ATTLIST BLOCKQUOTE
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  cite        %URL;      #IMPLIED  -- URL for source document or msg --
  >
<!ELEMENT Q - - (%inline;)* -- short inline quotation -->
<!ATTLIST Q
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  cite        %URL;      #IMPLIED  -- URL for source document or msg --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

Attribute definitions

cite = url
     The value of this attribute is a URL that designates a source document
     or message. This attribute is intended to give information about the
     source from which the quotation was borrowed.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information )
   * onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove,
     onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup (intrinsic events )

These two elements designate quoted text. BLOCKQUOTE is for long quotations
and Q is intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks.

This example formats an excerpt from "The Two Towers", by J.R.R. Tolkien, as
a blockquote.

<BLOCKQUOTE cite="http://www.mycom.com/tolkien/twotowers.html">
They went in single file, running like hounds on a strong scent,
and an eager light was in their eyes. Nearly due west the broad
swath of the marching Orcs tramped its ugly slot; the sweet grass
of Rohan had been bruised and blackened as they passed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Visual user agents generally render BLOCKQUOTE as an indented block.

Quotation marks We recommend that style sheets implementations provide a way
to insert quotation marks before and after a quotation delimited by Q or
BLOCKQUOTE in a manner appropriate to the current language context (see the
lang attribute) and the degree of nesting of quotations.

However, as some authors have used BLOCKQUOTE merely as a mechanism to
indent text, in order to preserve the intention of the authors, user agents
should not insert quotation marks in the default style.

Furthermore, if authors include quotation marks in a Q or BLOCKQUOTE
element, user agents should not insert additional quotation marks.

The usage of BLOCKQUOTE to indent text is deprecated in favor of style
sheets.

10.2.3 Subscripts and superscripts: the SUB and SUP elements

<!ELEMENT (SUB|SUP) - - (%inline;)* -- subscript, superscript -->
<!ATTLIST (SUB|SUP)
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information )
   * onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove,
     onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup (intrinsic events )

Many scripts (e.g., French) require superscripts or subscripts for proper
rendering. The SUB and SUP elements should be used to markup text in these
cases.

Here, we use SUP to raise the "lle" in the French "Mlle Dupont":

      M<sup>lle</sup> Dupont

10.3 Lines and Paragraphs

Authors traditionally divide their thoughts and arguments into sequences of
paragraphs. The organization of information into paragraphs is not affected
by how the paragraphs are presented: paragraphs that are double-justified
contain the same thoughts as those that are left-justified.

The HTML markup for defining a paragraph is straightforward: the P element
defines a paragraph.

The visual presentation of paragraphs is not so simple. A number of issues,
both stylistic and technical, must be addressed:

   * Treatment of white space
   * Line breaking and word wrapping
   * Justification
   * Hyphenation
   * Written language conventions and text directionality
   * Formatting of paragraphs with respect to surrounding content

We address these questions below. Paragraph alignment and floating objects
are discussed later in this document.

10.3.1 Paragraphs: the P element

<!ELEMENT P - O (%inline;)* -- paragraph -->
<!ATTLIST P
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  %align;                          -- align, text alignment --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: optional

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information )
   * align (alignment)
   * onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove,
     onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup (intrinsic events )

The P element represents a paragraph. It cannot contain block-level elements
(including P itself). The end tag may be omitted, in which case it is
implied by either the next block-level start tag or the end tag of the
element that contains the P element, whichever comes first.

For example, the following two paragraphs:

<P>This is the first paragraph.</P>
<P>This is the second paragraph.</P>
...a block element...

may be rewritten without their end tags:

<P>This is the first paragraph.
<P>This is the second paragraph.
...a block element...

since both are implicitly ended by the block elements that follow them.
Similarly, if a paragraph is enclosed by a block element, as in:

<DIV>
<P>This is the paragraph.
</DIV>

the end tag of the enclosing block element (here, DIV) implies the end tag
of the P element.

We discourage authors from using empty P elements. User agents should ignore
empty P elements.

10.3.2 Visual rendering of paragraphs

How paragraphs are rendered visually depends on the user agent. Paragraphs
are usually rendered flush left with a ragged right margin. Other defaults
are appropriate for right-to-left scripts.

HTML user agents have traditionally rendered paragraphs with white space
before and after, e.g.,

  At the same time, there began to take form a system of numbering,
  the calendar, hieroglyphic writing, and a technically advanced
  art, all of which later influenced other peoples.

  Within the framework of this gradual evolution or cultural
  progress the Preclassic horizon has been divided into Lower,
  Middle and Upper periods, to which can be added a transitional
  or Protoclassic period with several features that would later
  distinguish the emerging civilizations of Mesoamerica.

This contrasts with the style used in novels which indents the first line of
the paragraph and uses the regular line spacing between the line of the last
paragraph and the first line of the next, e.g.,

     At the same time, there began to take form a system of
  numbering, the calendar, hieroglyphic writing, and a technically
  advanced art, all of which later influenced other peoples.
     Within the framework of this gradual evolution or cultural
  progress the Preclassic horizon has been divided into Lower,
  Middle and Upper periods, to which can be added a transitional
  or Protoclassic period with several features that would later
  distinguish the emerging civilizations of Mesoamerica.

Following the precedent set by the NCSA Mosaic browser in 1993, user agents
generally don't justify both margins, in part because it's hard to do this
effectively without sophisticated hyphenation routines. The advent of style
sheets, and anti-aliased fonts with subpixel positioning promises to offer
richer choices to HTML authors than previously possible.

Style sheets provide rich control over the size and style of a font, the
margins, space before and after a paragraph, the first line indent,
justification and many other details. The user agent's default style sheet
renders P elements in a familiar form, as illustrated above. One could, in
principle, override this to render paragraphs without the breaks that
conventionally distinguish successive paragraphs. In general, since this may
confuse readers, we discourage this practice.

By convention, visual HTML user agents wrap text lines to fit within the
available margins. Wrapping algorithms depend on the script being formatted.

In Western scripts, for example, text should only be wrapped at white space.
Early user agents incorrectly wrapped lines at the beginning (or end) of
elements, which resulted in dangling punctuation. For example, consider this
sentence:

   A statue of the <a href="cih78">Cihuateteus</a>, who are patron ...

Wrapping the line at the end of the anchor tag causes the comma to be
stranded at the beginning of the next line:

  A statue of the Cihuateteus
  , who are patron ...

This is an error, since there was no white space at that point in the
markup.

10.3.3 Controlling line breaks

It is possible to force or forbid a line break in HTML.

Forcing a line break: the BR element

<!ELEMENT BR - O EMPTY            -- forced line break -->
<!ATTLIST BR
  %coreattrs;                      -- id, class, style, title --
  clear (left|all|right|none) none -- control of text flow --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: forbidden

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information )
   * clear (alignment and floating objects )

The BR element forcibly breaks (ends) the current line of text.

For visual user agents, the clear attribute can be used to determine whether
markup following the BR element flows around images and other objects
floated to the left or right margin, or whether it starts after the bottom
of such objects. Further details are given in the section on alignment and
floating objects. Authors are advised to use style sheets to control text
flow around floating images and other objects.

With respect to bidirectional formatting, the BR element should be treated
by user agents in the same way as a [UNICODE] LINE SEPARATOR character.

Prohibiting a line break

Sometimes authors may want to prevent a line break from occurring between
two words. The &nbsp; entity (&#160;, &#xA0;) acts as a space where user
agents should not cause a line break.

10.3.4 Hyphenation

In HTML, there are two types of hyphens: the plain hyphen and the soft
hyphen. The plain hyphen should be interpreted by a user agent as just
another character. The soft hyphen tells the user agent where a line break
can occur.

Those browsers that interpret soft hyphens must observe the following
semantics: If a line is broken at a soft hyphen, a hyphen character must be
displayed at the end of the first line. If a line is not broken at a hyphen,
the user agent must not display a hyphen character. For operations such as
searching and sorting, the soft hyphen should always be ignored.

In HTML, the plain hyphen is represented by the "-" character (&#45;,
&#x2D;). The soft hyphen is represented by the named character entity &shy;
(&#173;, &#xAD;)

10.3.5 Preformatted text: The PRE element

<!ENTITY % pre.exclusion "IMG|OBJECT|APPLET|BIG|SMALL|SUB|SUP|FONT|BASEFONT">

<!ELEMENT PRE - - (%inline;)* -(%pre.exclusion;) -- preformatted text -->
<!ATTLIST PRE
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  width       NUMBER     #IMPLIED
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

Attribute definitions

width = integer
     This attribute provides a hint to visual user agents about the desired
     width of the formatted block. The user agent can use this information
     to select an appropriate font size or to indent the content
     appropriately. The desired width is expressed in number of characters.
     This attribute is not widely supported currently.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information )
   * onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove,
     onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup (intrinsic events )

The PRE element tells visual user agents that the enclosed text is
"preformatted". Visual user agents must treat preformatted text as follows:

   * They may leave white space intact.
   * They may render text with a fixed-pitch font.
   * They may disable automatic word wrap.
   * They must not disable bidirectional processing.

Note that the SGML standard requires that the parser remove a newline
immediately following the start tag or immediately preceding the end tag of
the PRE.

The DTD fragment above indicates which elements may not appear within a PRE
declaration. This is the same as in HTML 3.2, and is intended to preserve
constant line spacing and column alignment for text rendered in a fixed
pitch font. Authors are discouraged from altering this behavior through
style sheets.

The following example shows a preformatted verse from Shelly's poem To a
Skylark:

<PRE>
       Higher still and higher
         From the earth thou springest
       Like a cloud of fire;
         The blue deep thou wingest,
And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.
</PRE>

Here is the same verse as rendered by your user agent:

       Higher still and higher
         From the earth thou springest
       Like a cloud of fire;
         The blue deep thou wingest,
And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.

The horizontal tab character
The horizontal tab character (encoded in [UNICODE], US ASCII, and [ISO88591]
as decimal 9) is usually interpreted by visual user agents as the smallest
non-zero number of spaces necessary to line characters up along tab stops
that are every 8 characters. We strongly discourage using horizontal tabs in
preformatted text since it is common practice, when editing, to set the
tab-spacing to other values, leading to misaligned documents.

10.4 Marking document changes: The INS and DEL elements

<!-- INS/DEL are handled by inclusion on BODY -->
<!ELEMENT (INS|DEL) - - (%inline;)* -- inserted text, deleted text -->
<!ATTLIST (INS|DEL)
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  cite        %URL;     #IMPLIED   -- info on reason for change --
  datetime    CDATA     #IMPLIED   -- when changed: ISO date format --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

Attribute definitions

cite = url
     The value of this attribute is a URL that designates a source document
     or message. This attribute is intended to point to information
     explaining why a document was changed.
datetime = cdata
     The value of this attribute specifies the date and time when the change
     was made. This value must have a format as specified in [ISO8601] and
     limited by the profile defined in the section below on dates and times.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information )
   * onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove,
     onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup (intrinsic events )

INS and DEL are used to markup sections of the document that have been
inserted or deleted with respect to a different version of a document (e.g.,
in draft legislation where lawmakers need to view the changes).

These two elements are unusual for HTML in that they are neither block-level
nor inline elements. They may contain one or more words within a paragraph
or contain one or more block-level elements such as paragraphs, lists and
tables.

User agents may render inserted and deleted text in ways that make the
change obvious. For instance, inserted text may appear in a special font,
deleted text may not be shown at all or be shown as struck-through or with
special markings, etc.

User agents that do not recognize the DEL element must render that element's
content nonetheless.

10.4.1 Date and time format

[ISO8601] allows many options and variations in the representation of dates
and times. This specification uses one of those formats in its definition of
legal values of the datetime attribute.

The format is:

  YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD

where:

     YYYY = four-digit year
     MM   = two-digit month (01=January, etc.)
     DD   = two-digit day of month (01 through 31)
     hh   = two digits of hour (00 through 23) (am/pm NOT allowed)
     mm   = two digits of minute (00 through 59)
     ss   = two digits of second (00 through 59)
     TZD  = time zone designator

The time zone designator is one of:

Z
     indicates UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).
+hh:mm
     indicates that the time is a local time which is hh hours and mm
     minutes ahead of UTC.
-hh:mm
     indicates that the time is a local time which is hh hours and mm
     minutes behind UTC.

Exactly the components shown here must be present, with exactly this
punctuation. Note that the "T" appears literally in the string, to indicate
the beginning of the time element, as specified in [ISO8601]

If a generating application does not know the time to the second, it may use
the value "00" for the seconds (and minutes and hours if necessary).

Both of the following examples correspond to November 5, 1994, 8:15:30 am,
US Eastern Standard Time.

     1994-11-05T13:15:30Z
     1994-11-05T08:15:30-05:00

Used with INS, this gives:

<INS datetime="1994-11-05T08:15:30-05:00"
        cite="http://www.foo.org/mydoc/comments.html">
Furthermore, the latest figures from the marketing department
suggest that such practice is on the rise.
</INS>

The document "http://www.foo.org/mydoc/comments.html" would contain comments
about why information was inserted into the document.

Authors may also make comments about inserted or deleted text by means of
the title attribute for the INS and DEL elements. User agents may present
this information to the user (e.g., as a popup note). For example:

<INS datetime="1994-11-05T08:15:30-05:00"
        title="Changed as a result of Steve B's comments in meeting.">
Furthermore, the latest figures from the marketing department
suggest that such practice is on the rise.
</INS>

                                  11 Lists

Contents

  1. Unordered (UL) and ordered (OL) lists
       1. Lists formatted by visual user agents
  2. Definition lists: the DL, DT, and DD elements
  3. The DIR and MENU elements

HTML offers authors several mechanisms for specifying lists of information.
All lists must contain one or more list elements. Lists may contain:

   * Unordered information.
   * Ordered information.
   * Definitions.

The previous list, for example, is an unordered list, created using the UL
element.

An ordered list, created using the OL element, should contain information
where order should be emphasized, as in a recipe:

  1. Mix dry ingredients thoroughly.
  2. Pour in wet ingredients.
  3. Mix for 10 minutes.
  4. Bake for one hour at 300 degrees.

Definition lists, created using the DL element, generally consist of a
series of term/definition pairs (although definition lists may have other
applications). Thus, when advertising a product, one might use a definition
list:

Lower cost
     The new version of this product costs significantly less than the
     previous one!
Easier to use
     We've changed the product so that it's much easier to use!
Safe for kids
     You can leave your kids alone in a room with this product and they
     won't get hurt (not a guarantee).

Lists may also be nested and different list types may be used together, as
in the following example, which is a definition list that contains an
unordered list (the ingredients) and an ordered list (the procedure):

The ingredients:
        o 100 g. flour
        o 10 g. sugar
        o salt, pepper
        o 1 cup Water
        o 2 eggs
The procedure:
       1. Mix dry ingredients thoroughly.
       2. Pour in wet ingredients.
       3. Mix for 10 minutes.
       4. Bake for one hour at 300 degrees.
Notes:
     The recipe may be improved by adding raisins.

The exact presentation of the three list types depends on the user agent. We
discourage authors from using lists purely as a means of indenting text.
This is a stylistic issue and is properly handled by style sheets.

11.1 Unordered (UL) and ordered (OL) lists

<!ENTITY % ULStyle "(disc|square|circle)">

<!ELEMENT UL - -  (LI)+ -- unordered list -->
<!ATTLIST UL
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --

<!ENTITY % OLStyle "CDATA"      -- constrained to: [1|a|A|i|I] -->

<!ELEMENT OL - -  (LI)+ -- ordered list -->
<!ATTLIST OL

  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

<!-- The type attribute can be used to change the bullet style
     in unordered lists and the numbering style in ordered lists -->

<!ENTITY % LIStyle "CDATA" -- constrained to: "(%ULStyle;|%OLStyle;)" -->

<!ELEMENT LI - O (%block;)+ -- list item -->
<!ATTLIST LI
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  type        %LIStyle;  #IMPLIED  -- list item style --
  value       NUMBER     #IMPLIED  -- reset sequence number --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: optional

Attribute definitions

type = style-information
     Deprecated.This attribute sets the style of a list item. Currently
     available values are intended for visual user agents. Possible values
     are described below.
start = integer
     For OL only. This attribute specifies the starting number of the first
     item in an ordered list. The default starting number is one.
value = integer
     For LI only. This attribute sets the current number of a list element
     in an ordered list to a new integer value.
compact
     Deprecated. When set, this boolean attribute gives a hint to visual
     user agents to render the list in a more compact way. The
     interpretation of this attribute depends on the user agent.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information)
   * onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove,
     onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup (intrinsic events)

Ordered and unordered lists are identical except that visual user agents
number ordered list items. User agents may present those numbers in a
variety of ways. Unordered list items are not numbered.

Both types of lists are made up of sequences of list items defined by the LI
element (whose end tag may be omitted).

This example illustrates the basic structure of a list.

<UL>
   <LI> ... first list item...
   <LI> ... second list item...
   ...
</UL>

Lists may also be nested:

<UL>
     <LI> ... Level one, number one...
     <OL>
        <LI> ... Level two, number one...
        <LI> ... Level two, number two...
        <OL start="10">
           <LI> ... Level three, number one...
        </OL>
        <LI> ... Level two, number three...
     </OL>
     <LI> ... Level one, number two...
</UL>

Details about number order. In ordered lists, it is not possible to continue
list numbering automatically from a previous list or to hide numbering of
some list items. However, authors can reset the number of a list item by
setting its value attribute. Numbering continues from the new value for
subsequent list items. For example:

<ol>
<li value="30"> makes this list item number 30.
<li value="40"> makes this list item number 40.
<li> makes this list item number 41.
</ol>

11.1.1 Lists formatted by visual user agents

The following description refers to the behavior of some current visual user
agents when formatting lists. Style sheets allow better control of list
formatting (e.g., for numbering, language-dependent conventions, indenting,
etc.).

Visual browsers usually present nested lists indented with respect to the
current level of indentation.

For both OL and UL, the type attribute specifies rendering options for
visual user agents.

For the UL element, possible values for the type attribute are disc, square,
and circle. The default value depends on the level of nesting of the current
list.

How each value is presented depends on the user agent. User agents should
attempt to present a "disc" as a small filled-in circle, a "circle" as a
small circle outline, and a "square" as a small square outline.

Your user agent displays them as follows (the bullet glyph in the line may
or may not vary):

   * is produced by the value "disc"
   + is produced by the value "square"
   o is produced by the value "circle"

For the OL element, possible values for the type attribute are summarized in
the table below:

          Type                     Numbering style
           1          arabic numbers             1, 2, 3, ...
           a           lower alpha               a, b, c, ...
           A           upper alpha               A, B, C, ...
           i           lower roman             i, ii, iii, ...
           I           upper roman             I, II, III, ...

Note that the type attribute is deprecated and list styles should be handled
through style sheets.

For example, using CSS, one may specify that the style of numbers for list
elements in a numbered list should be lower case roman numerals. In the
excerpt below, every OL element belonging to the class "withroman" will have
roman numerals in front of its list items.

<STYLE>
OL.withroman { list-stle-type: lower-roman }
</STYLE>
<BODY>
<OL class="withroman">
<LI> Step one ...
<LI> Step two ...
</OL>
</BODY>

11.2 Definition lists: the DL, DT, and DD elements

<!-- definition lists - DT for term, DD for its definition -->

<!ELEMENT DL - -  (DT|DD)+ -- definition list -->
<!ATTLIST DL
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  compact     (compact)  #IMPLIED  -- reduced interitem spacing --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

<!ELEMENT DT - O  (%inline;)* -- definition term -->
<!ELEMENT DD - O  (%block;)+ -- definition description -->
<!ATTLIST (DT|DD)
  %attrs;                         -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: optional

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information)
   * onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove,
     onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup (intrinsic events)

Definition lists vary only slightly from other types of lists in that list
items consist of two parts: a term and a description. The term is given by
the DT element and is restricted to marked up text (i.e., no block-level
elements). The description is given with a DD element and may contain
block-level content. Another use for DL is for dialogues, with each DT
naming a speaker, and each DD containing his or her words.

Here is an example with multiple descriptions per term.

<DL>
  <DT>cool
  <DD class="formal">a fairly low temperature, fairly cold.
  <DD class="slang">marvelous
  ...
</DL>

Here is another example:


<DL>
  <DT>Dweeb
  <DD>young excitable person who may mature
    into a <EM>Nerd</EM> or <EM>Geek</EM>

  <DT>Cracker
  <DD>hacker on the Internet

  <DT>Nerd
  <DD>male so into the Net that he forgets
    his wife's birthday
</DL>

The rendering of a definition list depends on the user agent. Your user
agent renders this example as follows:

Dweeb
     young excitable person who may mature into a Nerd or Geek
Cracker
     hacker on the Internet
Nerd
     male so into the Net that he forgets his wife's birthday

11.3 The DIR and MENU elements

DIR and MENU are deprecated

<!ELEMENT (DIR|MENU) - -  (LI)+ -(%blocklevel;) -- directory list, menu list -->
<!ATTLIST DIR
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  compact     (compact)  #IMPLIED
  >
<!ATTLIST MENU
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  compact     (compact)  #IMPLIED
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information)
   * onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove,
     onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup (intrinsic events)

The DIR element was designed to be used for creating multicolumn directory
lists. The MENU element was designed to be used for single column menu
lists. Both elements have the same structure as UL, just different
rendering. In practice, a user agent will render a DIR or MENU list exactly
as a UL list.

We strongly recommend using UL instead of these elements.

                                  12 Tables

Contents

  1. Elements for constructing tables
       1. The TABLE element
       2. Table Captions: The CAPTION element
       3. Groups of rows: the THEAD, TFOOT, and TBODY elements
       4. Groups of columns: the COLGROUP and COL elements
       5. Table rows: The TR element
       6. Table cells: The TH and TD elements
  2. Table formatting by visual user agents
       1. Horizontal and vertical alignment
       2. Borders and rules
       3. Cell margins
  3. Some sample tables
       1. Sample 1
       2. Sample 2

The HTML table model allows authors to arrange all types of data into rows
and columns of cells. These cells may include text, preformatted text,
images, links, forms, form fields, other tables, etc. Table cells may either
contain "header" information (see the TH element) or "data" (see the TD
element). Cells may span multiple rows and columns.

Each table may have an associated caption (see the CAPTION element) that
provides a short description of the table's purpose. A longer description
should always be provided for the benefit of people using speech or Braille
based browsers. The HTML 4.0 table model also allows authors to label their
tables so that non-visual user agents may communicate heading information
about each cell to the user.

Rows (see the TR element) and columns may be grouped together to convey
additional structural information and may be rendered by user agents in ways
that emphasize this structure.

Table rows may be grouped into a head, foot and one or more body sections,
using the THEAD, TFOOT and TBODY elements. This can be exploited to support
scrolling of body sections independently of the head and foot sections. When
long tables are printed, the head and foot information may be repeated on
each page that contains table data.

Column properties may be declared in advance using the COL and COLGROUP
elements. This makes it practical for user agents to begin rendering the
table as data is downloaded without the need for a subsequent repaint when
all of the data has arrived.

Tables should not be used purely as a means to layout document content as
this may present problems when rendering to non-visual media. Additionally,
when used with graphics, these tables may force users to scroll horizontally
to view a table designed on a system with a larger display. To minimize
these problems, authors should use style sheets to control layout rather
than tables.

Note: This specification includes more detailed information about tables in
sections on table design rationale and implementation issues.

12.1 Elements for constructing tables

12.1.1 The TABLE element

<!-- Only one CAPTION is allowed in each TABLE -->
<!ELEMENT TABLE - -
     (CAPTION?, ((COL*|COLGROUP*), THEAD?, TFOOT?, TBODY+), CAPTION?)>
<!ATTLIST TABLE                 -- table element --
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  summary     CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- purpose/structure for speech o/p --
  align       %TAlign;   #IMPLIED  -- table position relative to window --
  bgcolor     %Color;    #IMPLIED  -- background color for cells --
  width       CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- table width relative to window --
  cols        NUMBER     #IMPLIED  -- used for immediate display mode --
  border      CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- controls frame width around table --
  frame       %TFrame;   #IMPLIED  -- which parts of table frame to include --
  rules       %TRules;   #IMPLIED  -- rulings between rows and cols --
  cellspacing CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- spacing between cells --
  cellpadding CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- spacing within cells --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

Attribute definitions

summary = cdata
     This attribute is used to provide a summary of the table's purpose and
     structure for user agents rendering to non-visual media such as speech
     and Braille.
align = left|center|right
     Deprecated. This attribute specifies the position of the table with
     respect to the document. Permitted values:
        o left: The table is to the left of the document.
        o center: The table is to the center of the document.
        o right: The table is to the right of the document.
width = length
     Deprecated. This attribute specifies the desired width of the entire
     table and is intended for visual user agents. In the absence of this
     attribute, table width is determined by the user agent.
cols = integer
     Deprecated. This attribute specifies the number of columns for the
     table. When specified, this attribute helps visual user agents render
     the table as soon as it receives incoming data, rather than having to
     wait for the entire table to determine the number of columns for
     certain.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information )
   * onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove,
     onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup (intrinsic events)
   * bgcolor (background color)
   * frame, rules, border (borders and rules)
   * cellspacing, cellpadding (cell margins)

The TABLE element contains all other elements that specify caption, rows,
content, and formatting. Authors should use the title attribute to provide a
summary of the table for non-visual user agents, covering its purpose and
structure.

Note. A new attribute for the table summary is needed because the caption
for visual users is generally insufficient. The title attribute is
inappropriate because browsers render this as a "tool tip" which is limited
to a single line of text. In some user agents, long lines are clipped.

Calculating the number of rows and columns in a table

The number of rows in a table is equal to the number of TR elements it
contains. User agents should ignore rows that are implied by cells spanning
rows beyond this number.

There are several ways to determine the number of columns:

   * Count the number of columns as specified by COL and COLGROUP elements
     which can only occur at the start of the table (after the optional
     CAPTION).
   * Scan each row in turn to compute the number of columns needed for each
     row, taking into account cells that span multiple rows and/or columns.
     Set the number of columns for the table to be the maximum number of
     columns from each row. For any row that has less than this number of
     columns, the end of that row should be padded with empty cells. The
     "end" of a row depends on the directionality of the table.
   * Use the cols attribute on the TABLE element. This is the weakest method
     since it doesn't provide any additional information about column
     widths. This may not matter, however, if the author uses style sheets
     to specify widths.

It is an error for these methods to return inconsistent values. In this
situation we recommend user agents use the value determined on the basis of
scanning the rows.

All tables in these examples have three columns:

<TABLE>
  <COL><COL><COL>
  ...the rest of the table...
</TABLE>

<TABLE>
  <COL span="3">
  ...the rest of the table...
</TABLE>

<TABLE>
<TR>
  <TD><TD><TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<TABLE cols="3">
  ...the rest of the table...
</TABLE>

Table directionality

The directionality of a table is specified by the dir attribute for the
TABLE element. For a left-to-right table (the default), column one is on the
left side of the table and row one is at the top. For a right-to-left table,
column one is one the right side and row one is at the top.

Similarly, for left-to-right tables (the default), extra row cells are added
to the right of the table, and for right-to-left tables, extra cells are
added to the left side.

When set for the TABLE element, the dir attribute also affects the direction
of text within table cells (since the dir attribute is inherited by
block-level elements).

To specify a right-to-left table, set the dir attribute as follows:

<TABLE dir="RTL">
...the rest of the table...
</TABLE>

The direction of text in individual cells can be changed by setting the dir
attribute in an element that defines the cell. Please consult the section on
bidirectional text for more information on text direction issues.

12.1.2 Table Captions: The CAPTION element

<!ELEMENT CAPTION - - (%inline;)*    -- table caption -->
<!ENTITY % CAlign "(top|bottom|left|right)">

<!ATTLIST CAPTION               -- table caption --
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  align       %CAlign;   #IMPLIED  -- relative to table --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

Attribute definitions

align = top|bottom|left|right
     Deprecated: This attribute specifies the position of the caption with
     respect to the table. Possible values:
        o top: The caption is at the top of the table. This is the default
          value.
        o bottom: The caption is at the bottom of the table.
        o left: The caption is at the left of the table.
        o right: The caption is at the right of the table.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information )
   * onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove,
     onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup (intrinsic events )

When present, the CAPTION element's text should describe the nature of the
table. The CAPTION element may come either immediately after the TABLE start
tag or immediately before the end tag. A table may only contain one caption.

Visual user agents allow sighted people to quickly grasp the structure of
the table from the headings as well as the caption. A consequence of this is
that captions will often be inadequate as a summary of the purpose and
structure of the table from the perspective of people relying on non-visual
user agents.

Authors should therefore take care to provide additional information
summarizing the purpose and structure of the table using the summary
attribute of the TABLE element. This is especially important for tables
without captions.

For instance,

<TABLE summary="Number, type, and whether taken with sugar.">
<CAPTION>Cups of coffee consumed by each senator</CAPTION>
...the rest of the table...
</TABLE>

Visual user agents should avoid clipping any part of the table including the
caption, unless a means is provided to access all parts, e.g., by horizontal
or vertical scrolling. We recommend that the caption text be wrapped to the
same width as the table. (See also the section on recommended layout
algorithms.)

12.1.3 Groups of rows: the THEAD, TFOOT, and TBODY elements

<!ELEMENT THEAD - O (TR)+ -- table header -->
<!ELEMENT TFOOT - O (TR)+ -- table footer -->

Start tag: required, End tag: optional

<!ELEMENT TBODY O O (TR)+ -- table body -->

Start tag: optional, End tag: optional

<!ATTLIST (THEAD|TBODY|TFOOT)   -- table section --
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  %cellhalign;                     -- horizontal alignment in cells --
  %cellvalign;                     -- vertical alignment in cells --
  >

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information )
   * onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove,
     onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup (intrinsic events )
   * align, char, charoff, valign (cell alignment)

Table rows may be grouped into a head, foot and one or more body sections,
using the THEAD, TFOOT and TBODY elements. This enables user agents to
support scrolling of body sections independently of the head and foot
sections. When long tables are printed, the head and foot information may be
repeated on each page that contains table data.

When present, each THEAD, TFOOT, and TBODY instance must contain one or more
rows (see TR).

This example illustrates the order and structure of table heads, feet, and
bodies.

<TABLE>
<THEAD>
     <TR> ...header information...
</THEAD>
<TFOOT>
     <TR> ...footer information...
</TFOOT>
<TBODY>
     <TR> ...first row of block one data...
     <TR> ...second row of block one data...
</TBODY>
<TBODY>
     <TR> ...first row of block two data...
     <TR> ...second row of block two data...
     <TR> ...third row of block two data...
</TBODY>
</TABLE>

TFOOT must appear before TBODY within a TABLE definition so that user agents
can render the foot before receiving all of the (potentially numerous) rows
of data. The following summarizes which tags are required and which may be
omitted:

   * The TBODY start tag is always required except when the table contains
     only one body and no head or foot sections. The TBODY end tag may
     always be safely omitted.
   * The start tags for THEAD and TFOOT are required when the head and foot
     sections are present respectively, but the corresponding end tags may
     always be safely omitted.

Conforming user agent parsers must obey these rules for reasons of backward
compatibility.

The table of the previous example could be shortened by removing certain end
tags, as in:

<TABLE>
<THEAD>
     <TR> ...header information...
<TFOOT>
     <TR> ...footer information...
<TBODY>
     <TR> ...first row of block one data...
     <TR> ...second row of block one data...
<TBODY>
     <TR> ...first row of block two data...
     <TR> ...second row of block two data...
     <TR> ...third row of block two data...
</TABLE>

12.1.4 Groups of columns: the COLGROUP and COL elements

The COLGROUP element

<!ELEMENT COLGROUP - O (col)* -- table column group -->
<!ATTLIST COLGROUP
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  span        NUMBER     1         -- default number of columns in group --
  width       CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- default width for enclosed COLs --
  %cellhalign;                     -- horizontal alignment in cells --
  %cellvalign;                     -- vertical alignment in cells --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: optional

Attribute definitions

span = integer
     When present, this attribute specifies the default number of columns in
     this group. User agents should ignore this attribute if the current
     column group contains one or more COL element. The default value of
     this attribute is one.
width = length
     This attribute specifies a default width for each column in the current
     column group. In addition to the standard pixel and percentage values,
     this attribute may take the special form "0*", which means that the
     width of each column in the group should be the minimum width necessary
     to hold the column's contents. This implies that a column's entire
     contents must be known before its width may be correctly set. If visual
     user agents render tables incrementally, then specifying "*0" will
     require a repaint when the end of the table is reached.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information )
   * onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove,
     onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup (intrinsic events )
   * align, char, charoff, valign (cell alignment)

A table must contain at least one column group. In the absence of any column
group definitions, a table is considered to have one column group that
includes all columns in the table. The COLGROUP element creates an explicit
column group. Each column group defined by COLGROUP may contain zero or more
COL elements.

The width attribute of the COLGROUP element specifies a default width for
each column in a column group. The special value "0*" tells user agents to
set every column in a group to its minimum width. This behavior may be
overridden by the presence of a COL element.

The table in the following example contains two column groups. The first
column group contains 10 columns and the second contains 5 columns. The
default width for each column in the first column group is 50 pixels. The
width of each column in the second column group will be the minimum for the
column.

<TABLE>
<COLGROUP span="10" width="50">
<COLGROUP span="5" width="0*">
<THEAD>
<TR> ...
</TABLE>

The COL element

<!ELEMENT COL - O EMPTY -- table column -->
<!ATTLIST COL                   -- column groups and properties --
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  span        NUMBER     1         -- number of columns spanned by group --
  width       CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- column width specification --
  %cellhalign;                     -- horizontal alignment in cells --
  %cellvalign;                     -- vertical alignment in cells --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: forbidden

Attribute definitions

span = integer
     This attribute is limited to integer values and has the following
     interpretation:
        o In the absence of a span attribute, each COL element represents
          one column.
        o If the span attribute is set to N > 0, the current COL element
          spans N columns in the table.
        o If the span attribute is set to 0, the current COL element spans
          the remaining columns in the table, including the current and
          final columns.
width = length
     This attribute specifies a default width for each column in the current
     column group. In addition to the standard pixel and percentage values,
     this attribute may take the special form "0*", which means that the
     width of the each column in the group should be the minimum width
     necessary to hold the column's contents. This implies that a column's
     entire contents must be known before its width may be correctly set. If
     visual user agents render tables incrementally, then specifying "*0"
     will require a repaint when the end of the table is reached.

     The attribute may also have the form "i*", where "i" is an integer.
     This is called a relative width. When allotting space to rows and
     columns, user agents allot absolute widths first, then divide up
     remaining available space among relative width rows or columns. Each
     relative width row or column receives a portion of the space
     proportional to the integer preceding the "*". The value "*" is
     equivalent to "1*".

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information )
   * onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove,
     onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup (intrinsic events )
   * align, char, charoff, valign (cell alignment)

A COL element does not define a column group in the same sense as COLGROUP;
it is simply a way to share attribute values among columns in a column
group. Note that COL elements are empty; they are only affected by
attributes.

The width attribute for COL affects the width of the columns associated with
the element. If a COL element spans several columns then its width attribute
specifies the width of each column in the span, not the width of the span as
a whole.

The table in this example contains two column groups. The first group
contains three columns, the second contains two columns. The available
horizontal space will be alloted as follows: First the user agent will allot
30 pixels to the first column. Then, the minimal space required for the
second column will be alloted to it. The remaining horizontal space will be
divided into six equal portions. Column three will receive two of these
portions, column four will receive one, and column five will receive three.


<TABLE>
<COLGROUP>
   <COL width="30">
   <COL width="0*">
   <COL width="2*">
<COLGROUP align="center">
   <COL width="1*">
   <COL width="3*" align="char" char=":">
<THEAD>
<TR> ...
</TABLE>

We have set the value of the align attribute in the second column group to
"center". All cells in every column in this group will inherit this value,
but may override it. In fact, the final COL does just that, by specifying
that every cell in the column it governs will be aligned along the ":"
character.

12.1.5 Table rows: The TR element

<!ELEMENT TR - O (TH|TD)+ -- table row -->
<!ATTLIST TR                    -- table row --
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  %cellhalign;                     -- horizontal alignment in cells --
  %cellvalign;                     -- vertical alignment in cells --
  bgcolor     %Color;    #IMPLIED  -- background color for row --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: optional

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information )
   * onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove,
     onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup (intrinsic events )
   * align, char, charoff, valign (cell alignment)

The TR elements acts as a container for a row of table cells. The end tag
may be omitted.

This sample table contains three rows, each begun by the TR element:

<TABLE summary="number, type and whether taken with sugar">
<CAPTION>Cups of coffee consumed by each senator</CAPTION>
<TR> ...A header row...
<TR> ...First row of data...
<TR> ...Second row of data...
...the rest of the table...
</TABLE>

12.1.6 Table cells: The TH and TD elements

<!ELEMENT (TH|TD) - O (%block;)+ -- table header cell, table data cell -->
<!ATTLIST (TH|TD)               -- header or data cell --
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  abbr        CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- abbreviation for header cell --
  axis        CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- names groups of related headers--
  axes        IDREFS     #IMPLIED  -- list of id's for header cells --
  nowrap      (nowrap)   #IMPLIED  -- suppress word wrap --
  bgcolor     %Color;    #IMPLIED  -- cell background color --
  rowspan     NUMBER     1         -- number of rows spanned by cell --
  colspan     NUMBER     1         -- number of cols spanned by cell --
  %cellhalign;                     -- horizontal alignment in cells --
  %cellvalign;                     -- vertical alignment in cells --
  width       %Pixels;   #IMPLIED  -- suggested width for cell --
  height      %Pixels;   #IMPLIED  -- suggested height for cell --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: optional

Attribute definitions

abbr = cdata
     This attribute defines an abbreviated name for a header cell. The
     default abbreviation for a cell is its content.
axis = cdata
     This attribute provides a name for a group of related headers. This
     allows the table to be mapped to a hierarchy where the branches
     correspond to choosing a header from a group and the leaf nodes are
     data cells.
axes = id-list
     The value of this attribute is a space-separated list of id values
     referencing header cells that relate to this cell. In the absence of
     this attribute, user agents may make other attempts to identify the
     pertinent header cells using the algorithm described below.
rowspan = integer
     This attribute specifies the number of rows spanned by the current
     cell. The default value of this attribute is one ("1"). The value zero
     ("0") means that the cell spans all rows from the current row to the
     last row of the table.
colspan = integer
     This attribute specifies the number of columns spanned by the current
     cell. The default value of this attribute is one ("1"). The value zero
     ("0") means that the cell spans all columns from the current column to
     the last column of the table.
nowrap
     Deprecated. When present, this boolean attribute tells visual user
     agents to disable automatic text wrapping for this cell. Style sheets
     should be used instead of this attribute (e.g., the "white-space"
     property of [CSS1]. Note: if used carelessly, this attribute may result
     in excessively wide cells.
width = length
     Deprecated. This attribute supplies user agents with a recommended cell
     width. It takes pixel values.
height = length
     Deprecated. This attribute supplies user agents with a recommended cell
     height. It takes pixel values.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information )
   * onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove,
     onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup (intrinsic events )
   * bgcolor (background color)
   * align, char, charoff, valign (cell alignment)

The TH element stores header information, while the TD element stores data.
This distinction enables user agents to render header and data cells
distinctly, even in the absence of style sheets.

Cells may be empty (i.e., contain no data).

The following table contains four columns of data, each headed by a column
description.

<TABLE summary="number, type and whether taken with sugar">
<CAPTION>Cups of coffee consumed by each senator</CAPTION>
<TR>
   <TH>Name</TH>
   <TH>Cups</TH>
   <TH>type</TH>
   <TH>Sugar?</TH>
<TR>
   <TD>T. Sexton</TD>
   <TD>10</TD>
   <TD>Espresso</TD>
   <TD>No</TD>
<TR>
   <TD>J. Dinnen</TD>
   <TD>5</TD>
   <TD>Decaf</TD>
   <TD>Yes</TD>
</TABLE>

Your user agent renders the beginning of this table as follows:

   Cups of coffee consumed by each
               senator

   Name   Cups Type of Coffee Sugar?
 T. Sexton10   Espresso       No
 J. Dinnen5    Decaf          Yes

To help distinguish the cells of this table, we can set the border attribute
of the TABLE element:

<TABLE border="border">
...the rest of the table...
</TABLE>

With a border, your user agent renders the beginning of this table as
follows:

  Cups of coffee consumed by
         each senator

   Name   Cups   type   Sugar?
 T. Sexton10   Espresso No
 J. Dinnen5    Decaf    Yes

Labeling cells for Speech Synthesis

The axis and axes attributes allow tables to be rendered effectively to
non-visual media such as speech and Braille based devices. They may also be
used together with style sheets for controlling the presentation.

In the following example table, the value of the axes attribute is set to
reference the corresponding header cell for that column:

<TABLE border="border" summary="Number, type, and whether taken with sugar">
<CAPTION>Cups of coffee consumed by each senator</CAPTION>
<TR>
   <TH id="t1">Name</TH>
   <TH id="t2">Cups</TH>
   <TH id="t3" abbr="Type">Type of Coffee</TH>
   <TH id="t4">Sugar?</TH>
<TR>
   <TD axes="t1">T. Sexton</TD>
   <TD axes="t2">10</TD>
   <TD axes="t3">Espresso</TD>
   <TD axes="t4">No</TD>
<TR>
   <TD axes="t1">J. Dinnen</TD>
   <TD axes="t2">5</TD>
   <TD axes="t3">Decaf</TD>
   <TD axes="t4">Yes</TD>
</TABLE>

This markup could be rendered to speech as:

Caption: Cups of coffee consumed by each senator
Summary: Number, type, and whether taken with sugar

Name: T. Sexton,   Cups: 10,   Type: Espresso,   Sugar: No
Name: J. Dinnen,   Cups: 5,    Type: Decaf,      Sugar: Yes

Note how the header "Type of Coffee" is abbreviated to "Type" using the abbr
attribute.

In the absence of the axes attribute, user agents may search for pertinent
headers according to the following algorithm. The goal of the algorithm is
to find an ordered list of headers. (In the following description of the
algorithm the table directionality is assumed to be from left to right.)

   * The first step is to search left from the cell's position to find row
     header cells. The next is to search upwards to find column header
     cells. Search in a given direction stops when the edge of the table is
     reached or when a data cell is found after a header cell.
   * Row headers are inserted into the list in the order they appear in the
     table, e.g., the leftmost headers are inserted before the header to
     their right.
   * Column headers are inserted after row headers, in the order they appear
     in the table. The topmost header is inserted before the header below
     it.
   * If a header cell has an axes attribute, then the headers referenced by
     this attribute are inserted into the list and the search stopped in the
     current direction.
   * TD cells with axis attributes are treated as acting as header cells.

For more complex tables, it is preferable to map the table to a hierarchy,
where each branch corresponds to choosing a header from a group. The leaf
nodes correspond to data cells.

The following presents the money spent on meals, hotels and transport in two
locations (San Jose and Seattle) for successive days. The header groups are
location, day, category and subtotal.

</TABLE>

The axis attribute enables user agents to reconstruct the following
hierarchy, which is shown below partially collapsed:

  San Jose
    25-Aug-97
      Meals
        37.74
      Hotels
        112.00
      Transport
        45.00
      Subtotal
    26-Aug-97
      Meals
        27.28
      Hotels
        112.00
      Transport
        45.00
    Subtotal
      Meals
      Hotels
      Transport
      Subtotal
  Seattle
    27-Aug-97
    28-Aug-97
  Totals
      Meals
      Hotels
      Transport
      Subtotal

User agents may offer the means to traverse the hierarchy and collapse and
expand nodes in the hierarchy. The value of the axis attribute should be
chosen meaningfully to describe the nodes in the hierarchy.

When a large enough portion of the hierarchy is expanded and leaf nodes are
being spoken, it may be desirable to preface it by speaking the branches
leading to the leaves. So rather than saying:

  25-Aug-97
   Meals: 37.74
   Hotels: 112.00
   Transport: 45.00
  26-Aug-97:
    Meals: 27.28
    Hotels: 112.00
    Transport: 45.00

a user agent may say instead:

  25-Aug-97, Meals: 37.74
  25-Aug-97, Hotels: 112.00
  25-Aug-97, Transport: 45.00
  26-Aug-97, Meals: 27.28
  26-Aug-97, Hotels: 112.0
  26-Aug-97, Transport: 45.0

The ability to provide effective rendering to speech is valuable for
multi-modal wireless browsers with limited display capabilities (e.g.,
Web-enabled pagers and phones) and for people with visual disabilities.

Cells that span several rows or columns

Cells may span several rows or columns. The number of rows or columns
spanned by a cell is set by the rowspan and colspan attributes for either
the TH or TD elements.

In this table definition, we specify that the cell in row four, column two
should span a total of three columns, including the current row.

<TABLE border="border">
<CAPTION>Cups of coffee consumed by each senator</CAPTION>
<TR><TH>Name<TH>Cups<TH>Type of Coffee<TH>Sugar?
<TR><TD>T. Sexton<TD>10<TD>Espresso<TD>No
<TR><TD>J. Dinnen<TD>5<TD>Decaf<TD>Yes
<TR><TD>A. Soria<TD colspan="3"><em>Not available</em>
</TABLE>

This table might be rendered by a visual user agent as follows:

Cups of coffee consumed by each senator
 --------------------------------------
 |   Name  |Cups|Type of Coffee|Sugar?|
 --------------------------------------
 |T. Sexton|10  |Espresso      |No    |
 --------------------------------------
 |J. Dinnen|5   |Decaf         |Yes   |
 --------------------------------------
 |A. Soria |Not available             |
 --------------------------------------

In your user agent this appears as:

   Cups of coffee consumed by each
               senator

   Name   Cups Type of Coffee Sugar?
 T. Sexton10   Espresso       No
 J. Dinnen5    Decaf          Yes
 A. Soria Not available

The next example illustrates how cell definitions that span more than one
row or column affect the definition of later cells. Consider the following
table definition:

<TABLE border="border">
<TR><TD>1 <TD rowspan="2">2 <TD>3
<TR><TD>4 <TD>6
<TR><TD>7 <TD>8 <TD>9
</TABLE>

This table might be rendered something like this:

-------------
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
----|   |----
| 4 |   | 6 |
----|---|----
| 7 | 8 | 9 |
-------------

In your browser this appears as:

 1    3
   2
 4    6
 7 8  9

Since the cell labeled "2" spans two rows, it affects the positions of the
cells defined in the following rows. Note that if cell "6" had not been
defined in row two, an extra empty cell would have been added by the user
agent to complete the row.

Similarly, in the following table definition:

<TABLE border="border">
<TR><TD>1 <TD>2 <TD>3
<TR><TD colspan="2">4 <TD>6
<TR><TD>7 <TD>8 <TD>9
</TABLE>

cell "4" spans two columns, so cell "6" is placed in column three.

-------------
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
--------|----
| 4     | 6 |
--------|----
| 7 | 8 | 9 |
-------------

In your browser this appears as:

 1 2  3
 4    6
 7 8  9

This example illustrates how one might create overlapping cells. In this
table, cell "5" spans two rows and cell "7" spans two columns, so there is
overlap in the cell between "7" and "9":


<TABLE border="border">
<TR><TD>1 <TD>2 <TD>3
<TR><TD>4 <TD rowspan="2">5 <TD>6
<TR><TD colspan="2">7 <TD>9
</TABLE>

This table might be rendered as follows to convey the overlap:

-------------
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
-------------
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
----|...|----
| 7 :   | 9 |
-------------

In your browser this appears as:

 1 2  3
 4    6
   5
 7    9

The rendering of overlapping cells is undefined. Rendering will vary between
user agents.

12.2 Table formatting by visual user agents

The following description describes the HTML table attributes that tell
visual user agents how to format tables. Style sheets will offer better
control of visual table formatting. At the writing of this specification,
[CSS1] did not offer mechanisms to control all aspects of visual table
formatting.

This version of HTML includes mechanisms to control:

   * horizontal and vertical alignment of cell contents
   * border styles
   * and cell margins

12.2.1 Horizontal and vertical alignment

The following attributes may be set for different table elements (see their
definitions).

<!-- horizontal alignment attributes for cell contents -->
<!ENTITY % cellhalign
  "align (left|center|right|justify|char) #IMPLIED
   char       CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- alignment char, e.g. char=':' --
   charoff    CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- offset for alignment char --"
  >
<!-- vertical alignment attributes for cell contents -->
<!ENTITY % cellvalign
  "valign (top|middle|bottom|baseline) #IMPLIED"
  >

Attribute definitions

align = left|center|right|justify|char
     This attribute specifies the alignment of data and the justification of
     text in a cell. Possible values:
        o left: Left-flush data/Left-justify text. This is the default value
          for table data.
        o center: Center data/Center-justify text. This is the default value
          for table headers.
        o right: Right-flush data/Right-justify text.
        o justify: Double-justify text.
        o char:Align text around a specific character.
valign = top|middle|bottom|baseline
     This attribute specifies the vertical position of data within a cell.
     Possible values:
        o top: Cell data is flush with the top of the cell.
        o middle: Cell data is centered vertically within the cell. This is
          the default value.
        o bottom: Cell data is flush with the bottom of the cell.
        o baseline: All cells in the same row as a cell whose valign
          attribute has this value should have their textual data positioned
          so that the first text line occurs on a baseline common to all
          cells in the row. This constraint does not apply to subsequent
          text lines in these cells.
char = cdata
     This attribute specifies a character within a text fragment which will
     act as an axis for alignment. The default value for this attribute is
     the decimal point character for the current language as set by the lang
     attribute (e.g., the period (".") in English and the comma (",") in
     French). The value of this attribute is case-sensitive.
charoff = length
     When present, this attribute specifies the offset to the first
     occurrence of the alignment character on each line. If a line doesn't
     include the alignment character, it should be horizontally shifted to
     end at the alignment position.

     When charoff is used to set the offset of an alignment character, the
     direction of offset is determined by the current text direction (set by
     the dir attribute). In left-to-right texts (the default), offset is
     from the left margin. In right-to-left texts, offset is from the right
     margin.

The table in this example aligns a row of currency values along a decimal
point. We set the alignment character to "." explicitly.

<TABLE border="border">
<COLGROUP>
<COL><COL align="char" char=".">
<THEAD>
<TR><TH>Vegetable <TH>Cost per kilo
<TBODY>
<TR><TD>Lettuce        <TD>$1
<TR><TD>Silver carrots <TD>$10.50
<TR><TD>Golden turnips <TD>$100.30
</TABLE>

The formatted table should look something like this:

------------------------------
|   Vegetable  |Cost per kilo|
|--------------|-------------|
|Lettuce       |        $1   |
|--------------|-------------|
|Silver carrots|       $10.50|
|--------------|-------------|
|Golden turnips|      $100.30|
------------------------------

Inheritance of alignment specifications

The alignment of cell contents can be specified on a cell by cell basis, or
inherited from enclosing elements, such as the row, column or the table
itself.

The order of precedence (from highest to lowest) for the attributes align,
char, and charoff is the following:

  1. An alignment attribute set on an element within a cell's data (e.g.,
     P).
  2. An alignment attribute set on a cell (TH and TD).
  3. An alignment attribute set on a column or column group (COL and
     COLGROUP). When a cell is part of a multi-column span, the alignment
     property is inherited from the cell definition at the beginning of the
     span.
  4. An alignment attribute set on a row or row group (TR, THEAD, TFOOT, and
     TBODY). When a cell is part of a multi-row span, the alignment property
     is inherited from the cell definition at the beginning of the span.
  5. An alignment attribute set on the table (TABLE).
  6. The default alignment value.

The order of precedence (from highest to lowest) for the attribute valign
(as well as the other inherited attributes lang, dir, and style) is the
following:

  1. An attribute set on an element within a cell's data (e.g., P).
  2. An attribute set on a cell (TH and TD).
  3. An attribute set on a row or row group (TR, THEAD, TFOOT, and TBODY).
     When a cell is part of a multi-row span, the attribute value is
     inherited from the cell definition at the beginning of the span.
  4. An attribute set on a column or column group (COL and COLGROUP). When a
     cell is part of a multi-column span, the attribute value is inherited
     from the cell definition at the beginning of the span.
  5. An attribute set on the table (TABLE).
  6. The default attribute value.

Furthermore, when rendering cells, horizontal alignment is determined by
columns in preference to rows, while for vertical alignment, rows are given
preference over columns.

The default alignment for cells depends on the user agent. However, user
agents should substitute the default attribute for the current
directionality (i.e., not just "left" in all cases).

User agents that do not support the "justify" value of the align attribute
should use the value of the inherited directionality in its place.

12.2.2 Borders and rules

Note.The HTML attributes for specifying borders and rules on tables are
deprecated in favor of style sheets. For example, the "border" property in
[CSS1] may serve this purpose.

The following attributes affect a table's external frame and internal rules.

Attribute definitions

frame = void|above|below|hsides|lhs|rhs|vsides|box|border
     Deprecated. This attribute specifies which sides of the frame that
     surrounds a table will be visible. Possible values:
        o void: No sides. This is the default value.
        o above: The top side only.
        o below: The bottom side only.
        o hsides: The top and bottom sides only.
        o vsides: The right and left sides only.
        o lhs: The left-hand side only.
        o rhs: The right-hand side only.
        o box: All four sides.
        o border: All four sides.
rules = none|groups|rows|cols|all
     Deprecated.This attribute specifies which rules will appear between
     cells within a table. The rendering of rules is user agent dependent.
     Possible values:
        o none: No rules. This is the default value.
        o groups: Rules will appear between row groups (see THEAD, TFOOT,
          and TBODY) and column groups (see COLGROUP and COL) only.
        o rows: Rules will appear between rows only.
        o cols: Rules will appear between columns only.
        o all: Rules will appear between all rows and columns.
border = cdata
     DeprecatedThis attributes specifies the width (in pixels only) of the
     frame around a table (see the Note below for more information about
     this attribute).

In the following table, borders five pixels thick will be rendered on the
left- and right-hand sides of the table and rules should be displayed
between all columns.

<TABLE border="5" frame="vsides" rules="cols">
<TR> <TD>1 <TD>2 <TD>3
<TR> <TD>4 <TD>5 <TD>6
<TR> <TD>7 <TD>8 <TD>9
</TABLE>

The following settings should be observed by user agents for backwards
compatibility.

   * Setting border="0" implies frame="void" and, unless otherwise
     specified, rules="none".
   * Other values of border imply frame="border" and, unless otherwise
     specified, rules="all".
   * The value "border" in the start tag of the TABLE element should be
     interpreted as the value of the frame attribute. It implies rules="all"
     and some default (non-zero) value for the border attribute.

Thus, for example, the following definitions are equivalent:

<TABLE border="2">
<TABLE border="2" frame="border" rules="all">

and the following definitions too:

<TABLE border>
<TABLE frame="border" rules="all">

Note. The border attribute also defines the border behavior for the OBJECT
and IMG elements, but takes different values for those elements.

12.2.3 Cell margins

Two attributes control spacing between and within cells.

Attribute definitions

cellspacing = length
     This attribute specifies how much space should be left between the
     table frame and the first or last cell border for each row or column,
     and between the cells in a table.
cellpadding = length
     This attribute specifies the amount of space between the border of the
     cell and its contents, on all sides of the contents.

In the following table, the cellspacing attribute specifies that cells will
be separated from each other and from the table frame by twenty pixels. The
cellpadding attribute specifies that the top margin of the cell and the
bottom margin of the cell will each be separated from the cell's contents by
10% of the available vertical space (the total being 20%). Similarly, the
left margin of the cell and the right margin of the cell will each be
separated from the cell's contents by 10% of the available horizontal space
(the total being 20%).

<TABLE>
<TR cellspacing="20"> <TD>Data1 <TD cellpadding="20%">Data2 <TD>Data3
</TABLE>

If a table or given column has a fixed width, cellspacing and cellpadding
may demand more space than assigned. We recommend that user agents give
these attributes precedence over the width attribute when a conflict occurs,
but this is not a requirement.

12.3 Some sample tables

The following table samples illustrate the interaction of all the table
elements.

12.3.1 Sample 1

In "ascii art", the following table:

<TABLE border="border">
<CAPTION>A test table with merged cells</CAPTION>
<TR><TH rowspan=2><TH colspan="2">Average
    <TH rowspan="2">other<BR>category<TH>Misc
<TR><TH>height<TH>weight
<TR><TH align="left">males<TD>1.9<TD>0.003
<TR><TH align="left" rowspan="2">females<TD>1.7<TD>0.002
</TABLE>

would be rendered something like this:

              A test table with merged cells
    /--------------------------------------------------\
    |          |      Average      |  other   |  Misc  |
    |          |-------------------| category |--------|
    |          |  height |  weight |          |        |
    |-----------------------------------------|--------|
    | males    | 1.9     | 0.003   |          |        |
    |-----------------------------------------|--------|
    | females  | 1.7     | 0.002   |          |        |
    \--------------------------------------------------/

On your browser, the table looks like this:

    A test table with merged cells

           Average      other   Misc
        height weight  category

 males  1.9    0.003
 females1.7    0.002

12.3.2 Sample 2

This example illustrates how COLGROUP can be used to group columns and set
the default column alignment. Similarly, TBODY is used to group rows. The
frame and rules attributes tell the user agent which borders and rules to
render.

13.1 Introduction to links and anchors

HTML offers many of the conventional publishing idioms for rich text and
structured documents, but what separates it from most other markup languages
is its features for hypertext and interactive documents. This section
introduces the link (or hyperlink, or Web link), the basic hypertext
construct. A link is a connection from one Web resource to another. Although
a simple concept, the link has been one of the primary forces driving the
success of the Web.

A link has two ends --- called anchors --- and a direction. The link starts
at the "source" anchor and points to the "destination" anchor, which may be
any Web resource (e.g., an image, a video clip, a sound bite, a program, an
HTML document, an element within an HTML document, etc.).

13.1.1 Visiting a linked resource

The most common use of a link is to retrieve another resource on the Web.

The following HTML excerpt contains two links, one whose destination anchor
is an HTML document named "chapter2.html" and the other whose destination
anchor is a GIF image in the file "forest.gif":

<BODY>
...some text...
You'll find a lot more in  <A href="./chapter2.html">chapter two</A>.
See also this <A href="../images/forest.gif">map of the enchanted forest.</A>
</BODY>

By activating these links (by clicking with the mouse, through keyboard
input, voice commands, etc.), users may visit these resources. Note that an
attribute in each source anchor specifies the address of the destination
anchor with a URL.

The destination anchor of a link may be an element within an HTML document.
The destination anchor must be given an anchor name and any URL addressing
this anchor must include the name as its fragment identifier.

Destination anchors in HTML documents may be specified either by the A
element (naming it with the id attribute), or by any other element (naming
with the id attribute).

Thus, for example, an author might create a table of contents whose entries
link to header elements H2, H3, etc., in the same document. Using the A
element to create destination anchors, we would write:

<BODY>
<H1>Table of Contents</H1>
<A href="#section1">Introduction</A><BR>
<A href="#section2">Some background</A><BR>
<A href="#section2.1">On a more personal note</A><BR>
...the rest of the table of contents...
...the document body...
<H2><A name="section1">Introduction</A></H2>
...section 1...
<H2><A name="section2">Some background</A></H2>
...section 2...
<H3><A name="section2.1">On a more personal note</A></H2>
...section 2.1...

We may achieve the same effect by making the header elements themselves the
anchors:

<BODY>
<H1>Table of Contents</H1>
<A href="#section1">Introduction</A><BR>
<A href="#section2">Some background</A><BR>
<A href="#section2.1">On a more personal note</A><BR>
...the rest of the table of contents...
...the document body...
<H2 id="section1">Introduction</H2>
...section 1...
<H2 id="section1">Some background</H2>
...section 2...
<H3 id="section1">On a more personal note</H3>
...section 2.1...

13.1.2 Other link relationships

By far the most common use of a link is to retrieve another Web resource, as
illustrated in the previous examples. However, authors may insert links in
their documents that express other relationships between resources than
simply "activate this link to visit that related resource". Links that
express other types of relationships have one or more link type specified in
their source anchor.

For instance, links defined by the LINK element may describe the position of
a document within a series of documents. In the following excerpt, links
within the document entitled "Chapter 5" point to the previous and next
chapters:

<HEAD>
...other head information...
<TITLE>Chapter 5</TITLE>
<LINK rel="prev" href="chapter4.html">
<LINK rel="next" href="chapter6.html">
</HEAD>

The link type of the first link is "next" and that of the second is "prev"
(two of several recognized link types). Links specified by LINK are not
rendered with the document's contents, although user agents may render them
in other ways (e.g., as navigation tools).

Even if they are not used for navigation, these links may be interpreted in
interesting ways. For example, a user agent that prints a series of HTML
documents as a single document may use this link information as the basis of
forming a coherent linear document.

13.1.3 Specifying links and anchors

There are two HTML elements that create links: LINK and A. The LINK element
may only appear in the head of a document. The A element may only appear in
the body.

When the A element's href attribute is set, the element specifies a link
that may be activated by the user to retrieve a Web resource. The source
anchor is the location of the A instance and the destination anchor is the
Web resource.

The retrieved resource may be handled by the user agent in several ways: by
opening a new HTML document in the same user agent window, opening a new
HTML document in a different window, starting a new program to handle the
resource, etc. Since the A element has content (text, images, etc.), user
agents may render this content in such a way as to indicate the presence of
a link (e.g., by underlining the content).

When the name attribute of the A element is set, the element specifies an
anchor that may be the destination of other links.

Authors may set the name and href attributes simultaneously in the same A
instance.

The LINK element defines a relationship between the current document and
another resource. Although LINK has no content, the relationships it defines
may be rendered by some user agents.

13.1.4 Link titles

The title attribute may be set for both A and LINK to add information about
the nature of a link. This information may be spoken by a user agent,
rendered as a tool tip, cause a change in cursor image, etc.

Thus, we may augment a previous example by supplying a title for each link:

<BODY>
...some text...
Go to
<A href="./chapter2.html"
  title="Get chapter two.">chapter two</A>.
See also this <A href="../images/forest.gif"
  title="GIF image of enchanted forest">map of
the enchanted forest.</A>
</BODY>

13.1.5 Internationalization and links

Since links may point to documents written in different languages (possibly
with different script direction) and using different character encodings,
the A and LINK elements support the lang (language), and charset (character
encoding) attributes. These attributes allow authors to advise user agents
about the nature of the data at the other end of the link.

Armed with this additional knowledge, user agents should be able to avoid
presenting "garbage" to the user. Instead, they may either locate resources
necessary for the correct presentation of the document or, if they cannot
locate the resources, they should at least warn the user that the document
will be unreadable and explain the cause.

13.2 Resource retrieval: the A element

<!ELEMENT A - - (%inline;)* -(A) -- anchor -->
<!ATTLIST A
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --

  onfocus     %Script;   #IMPLIED  -- the element got the focus --
  onblur      %Script;   #IMPLIED  -- the element lost the focus --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

Attribute definitions

name = cdata
     This attribute names the current anchor so that it may be the
     destination of another link. The value of this attribute must be a
     unique anchor name. The scope of this name is the current document.
     Note that this attribute shares the same name space as the id
     attribute.
href = url
     This attribute specifies the location of a Web resource, thus defining
     a link between the current element (the source anchor) and the
     destination anchor defined by this attribute.
rel = cdata
     This attribute describes the link from the current document to the
     anchor specified by the href attribute. This value of this attribute is
     one or more link types separated by white space characters.
rev = cdata
     This attribute is used to describe a reverse link from the anchor
     specified by the href attribute to the current document. The value of
     this attribute is one or more link types separated by white space
     characters.
charset = cdata
     This attribute specifies the character encoding of the data designated
     by the link. The value of this attribute must be the name of a
     "charset" as defined in [RFC2045] (e.g., "euc-jp"). There is no default
     value for this attribute. When missing, user agents must follow the
     steps set out in the section on the HTML Document Character Set in
     order to determine the character encoding (if any) of the resource
     designated by the link.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information )
   * onfocus, onblur, onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup,
     onmouseover, onmousemove, onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup
     (intrinsic events )
   * target (target frame information)
   * tabindex (tabbing navigation)
   * accesskey (access keys)

The A element defines either one or two anchors:

  1. The A element's content defines the position of the source anchor.
  2. The href attribute specifies the location of the destination anchor.

If the name attribute is set, it names location of the A element so that it
may also be the destination of other links.

In the example that follows, the A element defines a link. The source anchor
is the text "W3C Web site" and the destination anchor is
"http://www.w3.org/":

For more information about W3C, please consult the
<A href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C Web site</A>

This link designates the home page of the World Wide Web Consortium. When a
user activates this link in a user agent, the user agent will retrieve the
resource, in this case, an HTML document.

User agents generally render links in such a way as to make them obvious to
users (underlining, reverse video, etc.). Rendering depends on the user
agent. Rendering may vary according to whether the user has already visited
the link or not. One possible rendering of the previous link might be:

For more information about W3C, please consult the W3C Web site.
                                                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~

To tell user agents explicitly what the character encoding of the
destination page is, set the charset attribute:

For more information about W3C, please consult the
<A href="http://www.w3.org/" charset="ISO-8859-1">W3C Web site</A>

Suppose we define an anchor named "anchor-one" in the file "one.html".

...text before the anchor...
<A name="anchor-one">This is the location of anchor one.</A>
...text after the anchor...

This creates an anchor around the text "This is the location of anchor one".
Usually, the contents of A are not rendered in any special way when A
defines an anchor only.

Having defined the anchor, we may link to it from the same or another
document. URLs that designate anchors end with "#" followed by the anchor
name. Here are some examples of such URLs:

   * An absolute URL: http://www.mycompany.com/one.html#anchor-one
   * A relative URL: ../one.html#anchor-one
   * When the link is defined in the same document: #anchor-one

Thus, a link defined in the file "two.html" in the same directory as
"one.html" would refer to the anchor as follows:

...text before the link...
For more information, please consult <A href="./one.html#anchor-one"> anchor one</A>.
...text after the link...

The A element in the following example specifies a link (with href) and
creates a named anchor (with name) simultaneously:

I just returned from vacation! Here's a
<A name="anchor-two"
   href="http://www.somecompany.com/People/Ian/vacation/family.png">
photo of my family at the lake.</A>.

This example contains a link to a different type of Web resource (a PNG
image). Activating the link should cause the image resource to be retrieved
from the Web (and possibly displayed if the system has been configured to do
so).

Note: Some user agents fail to find anchors represented by empty A elements.
For example, some user agents may not find the "empty-anchor" in the
following HTML fragment:

<A name="empty-anchor"></A>
<EM>...some HTML...</EM>
<A href="#empty-anchor">Link to empty anchor</A>

13.2.1 Syntax of anchor names

An anchor name is the value of either the name or id attribute when used in
the context of anchors. Anchor names must observe the following rules:

   * Uniqueness Anchor names must be unique within a document. Anchor names
     that differ only in case may not appear in the same document.
   * String matching Comparisons between fragment URL identifiers and anchor
     names must be done by exact match.

Thus, the following example is correct with respect to string matching and
must be considered a match by user agents:

<A href="#xxx">...>/A>
...more document...
<A name="xxx">...>/A>

ILLEGAL EXAMPLE:
The following example is illegal with respect to uniqueness since the two
names are the same except for case:

<A name="xxx">...>/A>
<A name="XXX">...>/A>

Although the following excerpt is considered legal HTML, the behavior of the
user agent is not defined; some user agents may consider this a match and
others may not.

<A href="#xxx">...>/A>
...more document...
<A name="XXX">...>/A>

13.2.2 Mailto links

Authors may create links that do not lead to another document but instead
cause email to be sent to an email address. When the link is activated, user
agents should cause a mail program to open that includes the destination
email address in the "To:" field.

To cause email to be sent when a link is activated, specify a MAILTO URL as
the value of the href attribute.

In this example, when the user activates the link, the user agent should
open a mail program with the address "joe@someplace.com" in the "To:" field.

...this is text...
For all comments, please send email to
<A href="mailto:joe@someplace.com">Joe Cool</A>.

13.2.3 Nested links

Links and anchors defined by the A element may not be nested.

ILLEGAL EXAMPLE:
The following example illustrates nested links. Nested links are not
permitted.

This text contains
<A name="outer-anchor" href="next-outer.html">an outer anchor and
and link and <A name="inner-anchor" href="next-inner.html">an inner
anchor and link.</A></A>

13.2.4 Anchors with the id attribute

The id attribute may be used to create anchor at the start tag of any
element.

This example illustrates the use of the id attribute to position an anchor
in an H2 element. The anchor is linked to via the A element.

You may read more about this in <A href="#section2">Section Two</A>.
...later in the document
<H2 id="section2">Section Two</H2>
...later in the document
Please refer to <A href="#section2">Section Two</A> above
for more details.

The id and name attributes share the same name space. This means that they
cannot both define an anchor with the same name in the same document.

ILLEGAL EXAMPLE:
The following excerpt is illegal HTML since these attributes declare the
same name twice in the same document.

<BODY>
<A href="#a1">...</A>
...
<H1 id="a1">
...pages and pages...
<A name="a1"></A>
</BODY>

Because of its specification in the HTML DTD, the name attribute may contain
entities. Thus, the value D&#xfc;rst is a valid name, as is D&uumlaut;rst .
The id attribute, on the other hand, may not contain entities.

13.3 Document relationships: the LINK element

<!ELEMENT LINK - O EMPTY -- a media-independent link -->
<!ATTLIST LINK
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  charset     CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- char encoding of linked resource --
  href        %URL;      #IMPLIED  -- URL for linked resource --
  rel         CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- forward link types --
  rev         CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- reverse link types --
  type    %ContentType;  #IMPLIED  -- advisory Internet content type --
  media       CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- for rendering on these media --
  target      CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- where to render linked resource --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: forbidden

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information )
   * onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove,
     onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup (intrinsic events )
   * href, rel, rev (links and anchors)
   * target (target frame information)
   * type, media (header style information)
   * charset(character encodings)

This element, which must appear in the HEAD section of a document (any
number of times), defines a media-independent link. Although LINK has no
content, it conveys relationship information that may be rendered by some
user agents in a variety of ways (e.g., a tool-bar with a drop-down menu of
links).

This example illustrates how several LINK definitions may appear in the HEAD
section of a document. The rel and rev attributes specify where the source
and destination are for each link. The values "Index", "Next", and "Prev"
are explained in the section on link types.

<HTML>
<HEAD>
  <LINK rel="Index" href="../index.html">
  <LINK rel="Next"  href="Chapter3.html">
  <LINK rel="Prev"  href="Chapter1.html">
</HEAD>
...the rest of the document...

13.3.1 Reverse Links

The rel and rev attributes play complementary roles. Consider two documents
A and B.

Document A:       <LINK href="docB" rel="foo">

Has exactly the same meaning as:

Document B:       <LINK href="docA" rev="foo">

13.3.2 Link types

A link's types are defined by the values of its rel and rev attributes. Both
attributes may be specified in the same element start tag. White space
characters are not permitted within link types, since these are used as
delimiters between one type and the next.

Authors may use the following recognized link types, listed here with their
conventional interpretations. These are defined as being case insensitive,
i.e., "Alternate" has the same meaning as "alternate".

Authors may wish to define additional link types not described in this
specification. If they do so, they should use a profile to cite the
conventions used to define the link types. Please see the profile attribute
of the HEAD element for more details.

User agents, search engines, etc. may interpret these link types in a
variety of ways. For example, user agents may provide access to linked
documents through a navigation bar.

Alternate
     Designates substitute versions for the document in which the link
     occurs. When used together with the lang attribute, it implies a
     translated version of the document. When used together with the media
     attribute, it implies a version designed for a different medium (or
     media).
Stylesheet
     Refers to an external style sheet. See the section on external style
     sheets for details. This is used together with the link type
     "Alternate" for user-selectable alternative style sheets.
Start
     Refers to the first document in a collection of documents. This link
     type tells search engines which document is considered by the author to
     be the starting point of the collection.
Next
     Refers to the next document in an linear sequence of documents. User
     agents may choose to preload the "next" document, to reduce the
     perceived load time.
Prev or Previous
     Refers to the previous document in an ordered series of documents.
Contents or ToC
     Refers to a document serving as a table of contents.
Index
     Refers to a document providing an index for the current document.
Glossary
     Refers to a document providing a glossary of terms that pertain to the
     current document.
Copyright
     Refers to a copyright statement for the current document.
Chapter
     Refers to a document serving as a chapter in a collection of documents.
Section
     Refers to a document serving as a section in a collection of documents.
Subsection
     Refers to a document serving as a subsection in a collection of
     documents.
Appendix
     Refers to a document serving as an appendix in a collection of
     documents.
Help
     Refers to a document offering help (more information, links to other
     sources information, etc.)
Bookmark
     Refers to a bookmark. A bookmark is a link to a key entry point within
     an extended document. The title attribute may used, for example, to
     label the bookmark. Note that several bookmarks may be defined in each
     document.

13.3.3 Links and external style sheets

When the LINK element links an external style sheet to a document, the type
attribute specifies the style sheet language and the media attribute
specifies the intended rendering medium or media. User agents may save time
by retrieving from the network only those style sheets that apply to the
current device.

Media types are further discussed in the section on style sheets.

13.3.4 Links and search engines

Authors may use the LINK element to provide a variety of information to
search engines, including:

   * Links to alternate versions of a document, written in another language.
   * Links to alternate versions of a document, designed for different
     media, for instance a version especially suited for printing.
   * Links to the starting page of a collection of documents.

The examples below illustrate how language information, media types, and
link types may be combined to improve document handling by search engines.

In the following example, we tell search engines where to find Dutch,
Portuguese, and Arabic versions of a document.

<HEAD>
<LINK lang="nl" title="The manual in Dutch"
      rel="alternate"
      href="http://someplace.com/manual/dutch.html">
<LINK lang="pt" title="The manual in Portuguese"
      rel="alternate"
      href="http://someplace.com/manual/portuguese.html">
<LINK lang="ar" title="The manual in Arabic"
      dir="rtl"
      rel="alternate"
      href="http://someplace.com/manual/arabic.html">
</HEAD>

In the following example, we tell search engines where to find the printed
version of a manual.

<HEAD>
<LINK media="print" title="The manual in postscript"
      rel="alternate"
      href="http://someplace.com/manual/postscript.ps">
</HEAD>

In the following example, we tell search engines where to find the front
page of a collection of documents.

<HEAD>
<LINK rel="Start" title="The first page of the manual"
      href="http://someplace.com/manual/postscript.ps">
</HEAD>

13.4 Path information: the BASE element

<!ELEMENT BASE - O EMPTY -- document base URL -->
<!ATTLIST BASE
  href        %URL;      #REQUIRED
  target      CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- where to render linked resource --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: forbidden

Attribute definitions

href = url
     This attribute specifies an absolute URL that acts as the base URL for
     resolving relative URLs.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * target (target frame information)

It is important to consider the issue of paths when linking to another
document or including an object. In HTML, path information is always
specified by a URL. Relative URLs are resolved according to a base URL,
which may come from a variety of sources (see the section on relative URLs
for information about sources of base URLs). The BASE element allows authors
to specify a document's base URL explicitly.

When present, the BASE element must appear in the HEAD section of an HTML
document. The scope of the BASE element is the current document only.

For example, given the following BASE declaration and A declaration:

<HTML>
 <HEAD>
   <TITLE>Our Products</TITLE>
   <BASE href="http://www.aviary.com/products/intro.html">
 </HEAD>

 <BODY>
   Have you see our <A href="../cages/birds.gif">Bird Cages</A>?
 </BODY>
</HTML>

the relative URL "../cages/birds.gif" would resolve to:

http://www.acme.com/cages/birds.gif

  7. How to specify alternate text

HTML's multimedia features allow authors to include images, applets
(programs that run on the user's machine), video clips, and other HTML
documents in their pages.

Previous versions of HTML allowed authors to include images (via IMG) and
applets (via APPLET). These elements have several limitations:

   * They fail to solve the more general problem of how to include new and
     future media types.
   * The APPLET element is based on proprietary technology and only works
     for java applets. This element is deprecated in favor of OBJECT.
   * They pose accessibility problems.

To address these issues, HTML 4.0 introduces the OBJECT element, which
offers an all-purpose solution to generic object inclusion. The OBJECT
element allows HTML authors to specify everything required by an object for
its presentation by a user agent: source code, initial values, and run-time
data. In this specification, the term "object" is used to describe the
things that people want to place in HTML documents, but other terms for
these things are: components, applets, plug-ins, media handlers, etc.

The new OBJECT element thus subsumes some of the tasks carried out by
existing elements. Consider the following chart of functionalities:

   Type of inclusion     Specific element    Generic element
 Image                 IMG                   OBJECT
 Applet                APPLET (Deprecated.)  OBJECT
 Another HTML document IFRAME                OBJECT

The chart indicates that each type of inclusion has a specific and a general
solution. The generic OBJECT element will serve as the solution for
implementing future media types.

To include images, authors may continue to use the IMG element as well.

To include applets, authors should use the OBJECT element as the APPLET
element is deprecated.

To include one HTML document in another, authors may use either the new
IFRAME element or the OBJECT element. In both cases, the embedded document
remains independent of the main document. Visual user agents may present the
embedded document in a distinct window within the main document.

Images and other included objects may have hyperlinks associated with them,
both through the standard linking mechanisms, but also via image maps. An
image map specifies active geometric regions of an included object and
assigns a link to each region. When activated, these links may cause a
document to be retrieved, may run a program on the server, etc.

In the following sections, we discuss the various mechanisms available to
authors for multimedia inclusions and creating image maps for those
inclusions.

14.1 Including an image: the IMG element

<!-- To avoid problems with text-only UAs you need to provide
     a description with ALT, and avoid server-side image maps -->
<!ELEMENT IMG - O EMPTY            --  Embedded image -->
<!ATTLIST IMG
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  src         %URL;      #REQUIRED -- URL of image to embed --
  alt         CDATA      #REQUIRED -- short description --
  longdesc    %URL;      #IMPLIED  -- link to long description --
  align       %IAlign;   #IMPLIED  -- vertical or horizontal alignment --
  height      %Pixels;   #IMPLIED  -- suggested height in pixels --
  width       %Pixels;   #IMPLIED  -- suggested width in pixels --
  border      %Pixels;   #IMPLIED  -- suggested link border width --
  hspace      %Pixels;   #IMPLIED  -- suggested horizontal gutter --
  vspace      %Pixels;   #IMPLIED  -- suggested vertical gutter --
  usemap      %URL;      #IMPLIED  -- use client-side image map --
  ismap       (ismap)    #IMPLIED  -- use server-side image map --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: forbidden

Attribute definitions

src = url
     This attribute specifies the location of the image resource. Examples
     of widely recognized image formats include GIF, JPEG, and PNG.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * alt (alternate text)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information)
   * onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove,
     onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup (intrinsic events)
   * ismap, usemap (client side image maps)
   * align, height, width, border, hspace, vspace (visual presentation of
     objects, images, and applets)

The IMG element embeds an image in the current document at the location of
the element's definition. The IMG element has no content; it is replaced
inline by the image designated by the src attribute.

In an earlier example, we defined a link to a family photo. Here, we insert
the photo directly into the current document:

<BODY>
I just returned from vacation! Here's a photo of my family at the lake:
<IMG src="http://www.somecompany.com/People/Ian/vacation/family.png"
     alt="A photo of my family at the lake.">
</BODY>

This inclusion also be achieved with the OBJECT element as follows:

<BODY>
I just returned from vacation! Here's a photo of my family at the lake:
<OBJECT data="http://www.somecompany.com/People/Ian/vacation/family.png"
        type="image/png">
A photo of my family at the lake.
</OBJECT>
</BODY>

The alt attribute specifies alternate text that is rendered when the image
cannot be displayed (see below for information on how to specify alternate
text ). User agents must render alternate next when they cannot support
images, they cannot support a certain image type or when they are configured
not to display images.

Please consult the section on the visual presentation of objects, images,
and applets for information about image size, alignment, and borders.

14.2 Generic inclusion: the OBJECT element

<!ELEMENT OBJECT - - (PARAM | %inline; | %blocklevel;)* -- generic embedded object -->

Start tag: required, End tag: required

Attribute definitions

classid = url
     This attribute specifies the location of a object's implementation via
     a URL.
codebase = url
     This attribute specifies the base path used to resolve relative URLs
     specified by classid (i.e., it gives the base URL when the object
     requires code). If this attribute is not specified, its default value
     is the base URL of the current document. Not all objects require this
     attribute.
codetype = cdata
     This attribute specifies the Internet Media Type (see [MIMETYPES]) of
     data expected by the object specified by classid. This attribute is
     optional but recommended when classid is specified since it allows the
     user agent to avoid loading information for unsupported media types. If
     no explicit value is given for this attribute, it defaults to the value
     of the type attribute.
data = url
     This attribute specifies the location of the data to be rendered.
type = cdata
     This attribute specifies the Internet Media Type (see [MIMETYPES]) for
     the data specified by data. This attribute is optional but recommended
     when data is specified since it allows the user agent to avoid loading
     information for unsupported media types. If no explicit value is given
     for this attribute, the user agent should attempt to determine the type
     of the data to be rendered.
declare
     When present, this boolean attribute makes the current OBJECT
     definition a declaration only. The object must be instantiated by a
     subsequent OBJECT definition referring to this declaration.
standby = cdata
     This attribute specifies a message that a user agent may render while
     loading the object's implementation and data.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information)
   * onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove,
     onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup (intrinsic events)
   * tabindex (tabbing navigation)
   * shapes, usemap (client side image maps)
   * name (submitting objects with forms)
   * align, height, width, border, hspace, vspace (visual presentation of
     objects, images, and applets)

Most user agents have built-in mechanisms for rendering common data types
such as text, GIF images, colors, fonts, and a handful of graphic elements.
To render data types they don't support natively, user agents generally run
external applications. The OBJECT element allows authors to control whether
objects should be rendered externally or by some program, specified by the
author, that renders the object within the user agent.

In the most general case, an author may need to specify three types of
information:

   * The implementation of the included object. For instance, if the
     included object is a clock applet, the author must indicate the
     location of the applet's executable code.
   * The data to be rendered. For instance, if the included object is a
     program that renders font data, the author must indicate the location
     of that data.
   * Additional values required by the object at run-time. For example, some
     applets may require initial values for parameters.

The OBJECT element allows authors to specify all three types of data, but
authors may not have to specify all three at once. For example, some objects
may not require data (e.g., a self-contained applet that performs a small
animation). Others may not require run-time initialization. Still others may
not require additional implementation information, i.e., the user agent
itself may already know how to render that type of data (e.g., GIF images).

Authors specify an object's implementation and the location of the data to
be rendered via the OBJECT element. To specify run-time values, however,
authors use the PARAM element, which is discussed in the section on object
initialization.

14.2.1 Rules for rendering objects

A user agent must interpret an OBJECT element according to the following
precedence rules:

  1. The user agent must first try to render the object.
  2. If the user agent is not able to render the object for whatever reason
     (configured not to, lack of resources, wrong architecture, etc.), it
     must try to render its contents.

In the following example, we insert an analog clock applet in a document via
the OBJECT element. The applet, written in the Python language, requires no
additional data or run-time values. The classid attribute specifies the
location of the applet:


<OBJECT classid="http://www.miamachina.it/analogclock.py">
</OBJECT>

Authors should complete this declaration by including alternate text as the
contents of OBJECT in case the user agent cannot render the clock.


<OBJECT classid="http://www.miamachina.it/analogclock.py">
An animated clock.
</OBJECT>

Note that the clock will be rendered as soon as the user agent interprets
this OBJECT declaration. It is possible to delay rendering of an object by
first declaring the object (described below).

One significant consequence of the OBJECT element's design is that it offers
a mechanism for specifying alternate object renderings; each embedded OBJECT
declaration may specify alternate content types. If a user agent cannot
render the outermost OBJECT, it tries to render the contents, which may be
another OBJECT element, etc.

In the following example, we embed several OBJECT declarations to illustrate
how alternate renderings work. A user agent will attempt to render the first
OBJECT element it can, in the following order: (1) an Earth applet written
in the Python language, (2) an MPEG animation of the Earth, (3) a GIF image
of the Earth, (4) alternate text.

                    <!-- First, try the Python applet -->
<OBJECT title="The Earth as seen from space"
        classid="http://www.observer.mars/TheEarth.py">
                    <!-- Else, try the MPEG video -->
  <OBJECT data="TheEarth.mpeg" type="application/mpeg">
                    <!-- Else, try the GIF image -->
    <OBJECT data="TheEarth.gif">
                    <!-- Else render the text -->
     The <STRONG>Earth</STRONG> as seen from space.
    </OBJECT>
  </OBJECT>
</OBJECT>

The outermost declaration specifies an applet that requires no data or
initial values. The second declaration specifies an MPEG animation and,
since it does not define the location of an implementation to handle MPEG,
relies on the user agent to handle the animation. We also set the type
attribute so that a user agent that knows it cannot render MPEG will not
bother to retrieve "TheEarth.mpeg" from the network. The third declaration
specifies the location of a GIF file and furnishes alternate text in case
all other mechanisms fail.

Inline vs. external data. Data to be rendered may be supplied in two ways:
inline and from an external resource. While the former method will generally
lead to faster rendering, it is not convenient when rendering large
quantities of data.

Please consult the section on the visual presentation of objects, images,
and applets for information about object size, alignment, and borders.

14.2.2 Object initialization: the PARAM element

<!ELEMENT PARAM - O EMPTY          -- named property value -->
<!ATTLIST PARAM
  id          ID         #IMPLIED  -- document-wide unique id --
  name        CDATA      #REQUIRED -- property name --
  value       CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- property value --
  valuetype (DATA|REF|OBJECT) DATA -- How to interpret value --
  type        CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- Internet media type --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: forbidden

Attribute definitions

name = cdata
     This attribute defines the name of a run-time parameter name, assumed
     to be known by the inserted object. Whether the property name is
     case-sensitive depends on the object.
value = cdata
     This attribute specifies the value of a run-time parameter specified by
     name. Property values have no meaning to HTML; their meaning is
     determined by the object in question.
valuetype = data|ref|object
     This attribute specifies the type of the value attribute. Possible
     values:
        o data: The value specified by value will be passed directly to the
          object's implementation as a string, after resolving any embedded
          character or numeric character entities. This is the default value
          for this attribute (and may appear alone in the start tag of the
          element).
        o ref: The value specified by value is a URL that designates a
          resource where run-time values are stored. The URL must be passed
          to the object as is, i.e., unresolved.
        o object: The value specified by value is a fragment URL that
          designates an OBJECT declaration in the same document. In this
          case, the OBJECT definition must be identifiable by its id
          attribute.
type = cdata
     This attribute specifies the Internet Media Type (see [MIMETYPES]) of
     the resource designated by the value attribute only in the case where
     valuetype is set to "ref". This attribute thus specifies for the user
     agent, the type of values that will be found at the URL designated by
     value.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id (document-wide identifiers)

The PARAM element specifies a set of values that may be required by an
object at run-time. Any number of of PARAM elements may appear at the
beginning of an OBJECT declaration, in any order. The syntax of names and
values is assumed to be understood by the object's implementation. Names and
values are passed to the object on its standard input. This specification
does not specify how user agents should interpret parameter names that
appear twice.

To illustrate the use of PARAM, we returning to the clock example. suppose
that the applet is able to handle two run-time parameters that define its
initial height and width. We can set the initial dimensions to 40x40 pixels
with two PARAM elements.


<OBJECT classid="http://www.miamachina.it/analogclock.py">
<PARAM name="height" value="40" valuetype="data">
<PARAM name="width" value="40" valuetype="data">
This user agent cannot render Python applications.
</OBJECT>

Since the default valuetype for a PARAM element is "data", we could replace
the above declarations with either:


<PARAM name="height" value="40">
<PARAM name="width"  value="40">

or:


<PARAM name="height" value="40" data>
<PARAM name="width"  value="40" data>

In the following example, run-time data for the object's "Init_values"
parameter is specified as an external resource (a GIF file). The value of
the valuetype attribute is thus set to "ref" and the value is a URL
designating the resource.

<OBJECT classid="http://www.gifstuff.com/gifappli"
       standby="Loading Elvis...">
<PARAM name="Init_values"
       value="./images/elvis.gif">
       valuetype="ref">
</OBJECT>

Note that we have also set the standby attribute so that the user agent may
display a message while the rendering mechanism loads.

14.2.3 URLs other than HTTP URLs

The location of an object's implementation is given by a URL. As we
discussed in the section on URLs, the first segment of an absolute URL
specifies the protocol used to transfer the data designated by the URL. For
HTML documents, this protocol is generally "http". Some applets might employ
other protocols. For instance, when specifying a Java applet, you may use
URLs that begin with "java" and for ActiveX applets, you may use "clsid".

In the following example, we insert a Java applet into an HTML document.

<OBJECT classid="java:program.start">
</OBJECT>

By setting the codetype attribute, a user agent can decide whether to
retrieve the Java application based on its ability to do so.

<OBJECT codetype="application/octet-stream"
        classid="java:program.start">
</OBJECT>

Some rendering schemes require additional information to identify their
implementation and must be told where to find that information. You may give
path information to the object's implementation via the codebase attribute.

<OBJECT codetype="application/octet-stream"
        classid="java:program.start">
        codebase="http://foooo.bar.com/java/myimplementation/"
</OBJECT>

The following example specifies (with the classid attribute) an ActiveX
object via a URL that begins with the protocol information "clsid". The data
attribute locates the data to render (another clock).

<OBJECT classid="clsid:663C8FEF-1EF9-11CF-A3DB-080036F12502"
        data="http://www.acme.com/ole/clock.stm">
This application is not supported.
</OBJECT>

14.2.4 Object declarations and instantiations

The preceding examples have only illustrated isolated object definitions.
When a document is to contain more than one instance of the same object, it
is possible to separate the declaration of the object from its
instantiations. Doing so has several advantages:

   * Data may be retrieved from the network by the user agent one time
     (during the declaration) and reused for each instantiation.
   * It is possible to instantiate an object from a location other than the
     object's declaration, for example, from a link.
   * It is possible to specify objects as run-time data for other objects.

To declare an object so that it is not executed when read by the user agent,
set the boolean declare attribute in the OBJECT element. At the same time,
you must identify the declaration by setting the id attribute in the OBJECT
element to a unique value. Later instantiations of the object will refer to
this identifier.

A declared OBJECT must appear in a document before the first instance of
that OBJECT.

An object defined with the declare attribute is instantiated every time the
OBJECT is referenced thereafter.

In the following example, we declare an OBJECT and cause it so be
instantiated by referring to it from a link. Thus, the object can be
activated by clicking on some highlighted text, for example.

<OBJECT declare
        id="earth_declaration"
        data="TheEarth.mpeg"
        type="application/mpeg">
   The <STRONG>Earth</STRONG> as seen from space.
</OBJECT>
...later in the document...
A neat <A href="#earth_declaration"> animation of The Earth!</A>

The following example illustrates how to specify run-time values that are
other objects. In this example, we send text (a poem, in fact) to a
hypothetical mechanism for viewing poems. The object recognizes a run-time
parameter named "font" (say, for rendering the poem text in a certain font).
The value for this parameter is itself an object that inserts (but does not
render) the font object. The relationship between the font object and the
poem viewer object is achieved by (1) assigning the id "tribune" to the font
object declaration and (2) referring to it from the PARAM element of the
poem viewer object (with valuetype and value).

<OBJECT declare
     id="tribune"
     type="application/x-webfont"
     data="tribune.gif">
</OBJECT>
...view the poem in KublaKhan.txt here...
<OBJECT classid="http://foo.bar.com/poem_viewer"
           data="KublaKhan.txt">
<PARAM name="font" valuetype="object" value="#tribune">
<P>You're missing a really cool poem viewer ...
</OBJECT>

User agents that don't support the declare attribute must render the
contents of the OBJECT declaration.

14.3 Including an applet: the APPLET element

APPLET is deprecated.

<!ELEMENT APPLET - - (PARAM | %inline;)* -- Java applet -->

Attribute definitions

codebase = url
     This attribute specifies the base URL for the applet. If this attribute
     is not specified, then the base URL for the applet is the same as for
     the current document. Values for this attribute may only refer to
     subdirectories of the directory containing the current document.
code = cdata
     This attribute specifies the name of the resource that contains the
     applet's compiled applet subclass. The value must be a relative URL
     with respect to the applet base URL.
name = cdata
     This attribute specifies a name for the applet instance, which makes it
     possible for applets on the same page to find (and communicate with)
     each other.
width = length
     This attribute specifies the initial width of the applet display area
     (not counting any windows or dialogs that the applet brings up).
height = length
     This attribute specifies the initial height of the applet display area
     (not counting any windows or dialogs that the applet brings up).
archive = cdata
     This attribute specifies the names of one or more comma-separated
     archives containing classes and other resources that will be
     "preloaded". The classes are loaded using an instance of an
     AppletClassLoader with the given codebase. Preloading resources can
     significantly improve the performance of applets.
object = cdata
     This attribute gives the name of the resource that contains a
     serialized representation of an applet. The applet will be
     "deserialized". The init() method will not be invoked; but its start()
     method will. Attributes valid when the original object was serialized
     are not restored. Any attributes passed to this applet instance will be
     available to the Applet.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information)
   * alt (alternate text)
   * align, width, height, hspace, vspace (visual presentation of objects,
     images, and applets)

This element, supported by all Java-enabled browsers, allows designers to
embed a Java applet in an HTML document. It has been deprecated in favor of
the OBJECT element.

The content of the APPLET acts as alternate information for user agents that
don't support this element or are currently configured not to support
applets. The content must be ignored otherwise.

In the following example, the APPLET element includes a Java applet in the
document. Since no codebase is supplied, the applet is assumed to be in the
same directory as the current document.

<APPLET code="Bubbles.class" width="500" height="500">
Java applet that draws animated bubbles.
</APPLET>

This example may be rewritten as follows with OBJECT as follows:

<OBJECT codetype="application/octet-stream"
        classid="java:Bubbles.class"
        width="500" height="500">
Java applet that draws animated bubbles.
</OBJECT>

Initial values may be supplied to the applet via the PARAM element.

The following sample Java applet:

<APPLET code="AudioItem" width="15" height="15">
<PARAM name="snd" value="Hello.au|Welcome.au">
Java applet that plays a welcoming sound.
</APPLET>

may be rewritten as follows with OBJECT:

<OBJECT codetype="application/octet-stream"
        classid="AudioItem"
        width="15" height="15">
<PARAM name="snd" value="Hello.au|Welcome.au">
Java applet that plays a welcoming sound.
</OBJECT>

14.4 Including HTML in another HTML document

Sometimes, rather than linking to another HTML document, it is helpful to
include it directly into a primary HTML document. Authors may use either the
IFRAME element or the OBJECT element for this purpose. The IFRAME element
differs from the OBJECT element, however, in that it may be a target frame
(see the section on specifying target frame information for details).

An embedded document is entirely independent of the document in which it is
embedded. For instance, relative URLs within the embedded document resolve
according to the base URL of the embedded document, not that of the main
document. Also, an embedded document does not inherit style information from
the main document. An embedded document is only rendered within another
document (e.g., in a subwindow); it remains otherwise independent.

For instance, the following line includes the contents of embed_me.html at
the location where the OBJECT definition occurs.

...text before...
<OBJECT data="embed_me.html">
Warning: embed_me.html could not be included.
</OBJECT>
...text after...

Recall that the contents of OBJECT must only be rendered if the file
specified by the data attribute cannot be loaded.

The behavior of a user agent in cases where a file includes itself is not
defined.

14.5 Image maps

Image maps allow authors to specify regions of an image or object and assign
a specific action to each region (e.g., retrieve a document, run a program,
etc.) When the region is activated by the user, the action is executed.

An image map is created by associating an object with a specification of
sensitive geometric areas on the object.

There are two types of image maps:

   * Server-side. When a user activates a region of a server-side image map
     with a mouse, the pixel coordinates of the click are sent to the server
     where the document is housed. The server interprets the coordinates and
     performs some action.
   * Client-side. When a user activates a region of a client-side image map
     with a mouse, the pixel coordinates are interpreted by the user agent.
     The user agent selects a link that was specified for the activated
     region and follows it.

Client-side image maps are preferred over server-side image maps.

14.5.1 Client-side image maps

HTML 4.0 has two mechanisms for specifying client-side image maps:

  1. An element employs an image map that is defined outside the element
     itself. In this case, the MAP and AREA elements define the image map.
     This method is available for the IMG, OBJECT, and INPUT elements.
  2. An element's content contains the image map. This method is only
     available for the OBJECT element.

For an OBJECT image map, the two methods are mutually exclusive. The
presence of either the usemap attribute or the shapes attribute for an
OBJECT implies that the object being included is an image.

Furthermore, when the OBJECT element has an associated client-side image
map, user agents may implement user interaction with the OBJECT solely in
terms of the client-side image map. This allows user agents (such as an
audio browser or robot) to interact with the OBJECT without having to
process it; the user agent may even elect not to retrieve (or process) the
object. When an OBJECT has an associated image map, authors should not
expect that the object will be retrieved or processed by every user agent.

Alternate access to image maps

User agents and authors should offer textual alternates to graphical image
maps for cases when graphics are not available or the user cannot access
them.

When MAP and AREA are used, authors are required to provide alternate text
for each active region by way of the alt attribute (see below for
information on how to specify alternate text). User agents may use this
alternate text to create substitute textual links. These links may be
activated in a variety of ways (keyboard, voice activation, etc.).

In the case of an OBJECT with the shapes attribute set, authors are required
to specify links within the content of the OBJECT itself. Each link defines
both the geometry of an active region and the destination program, document,
or other resource. When the OBJECT element can be displayed, its content is
ignored except for the definitions of the regions. When the OBJECT cannot be
displayed, its contents are rendered normally, including the links. Thus,
authors are not required to specify alternate text via an alt attribute.
This technique also allows richer alternate content that what may be
achieved with AREA and its alt attribute.

Client-side image maps with MAP, AREA, and usemap

All elements that may specify a client-side image map that is external to
the element must identify by name the MAP element that defines the image
map. The usemap attribute links an element to its image map.

Attribute definitions

usemap = url
     This attribute specifies the location of a map defined by MAP and AREA.

Here are the DTD fragments for MAP and AREA.

<!ELEMENT MAP - - (AREA)+ -- client-side image map -->
<!ATTLIST MAP
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  name        CDATA      #IMPLIED
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

<!ELEMENT AREA - O EMPTY -- client-side image map area -->
<!ATTLIST AREA
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  shape       %Shape;    rect      -- controls interpretation of coords --
  coords      %Coords;   #IMPLIED  -- comma separated list of values --
  href        %URL;      #IMPLIED  -- this region acts as hypertext link --
  target      CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- where to render linked resource --
  nohref      (nohref)   #IMPLIED  -- this region has no action --
  alt         CDATA      #REQUIRED -- short description --
  tabindex    NUMBER     #IMPLIED  -- position in tabbing order --
  accesskey   CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- accessibility key character --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: forbidden

Attribute definitions

shape = default|rect|circle|poly
     This attribute specifies the shape of a region. Possible values:
        o default: Specifies the entire region.
        o rect: Define a rectangular region.
        o circle: Define a circular region.
        o poly: Define a polygonal region.
coords = length-list
     This attribute specifies the position a shape on the screen. The number
     and order of values depends on the shape being defined. Possible
     combinations:
        o rect: left-x, top-y, right-x, bottom-y.
        o circle: center-x, center-y, radius.
        o poly: x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., xN, yN.

     Coordinates are relative to the top, left corner of the object. All
     values are lengths (they may be pixel values or percentages of the
     image size).
nohref
     When set, this boolean attribute specifies that a region has no
     associated link.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * title (element titles)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information)
   * name (submitting objects with forms)
   * alt (alternate text)
   * href ( anchor reference) target (frame target information)
   * tabindex (tabbing navigation)
   * accesskey (access keys)
   * shape, coords (image maps)

In the following example, we create a client-side image map for the IMG
element with MAP and AREA. We associate the image and the image map by (1)
naming the image map with the name attribute of the MAP element and (2)
designating that map by setting the usemap attribute on the IMG element.

<IMG src="navbar1.gif" usemap="#map1"></IMG>

<MAP name="map1">
 <AREA href="guide.html"
          alt="Access Guide"
          shape="rect"
          coords="0,0,118,28">
 <AREA href="search.html"
          alt="Search"
          shape="rect"
          coords="184,0,276,28">
 <AREA href="shortcut.html"
          alt="Go"
          shape="circ"
          coords="184,200,60">
 <AREA href="top10.html"
          alt="Top Ten"
          shape="poly"
          coords="276,0,373,28,50,50,276,0">
</MAP>

If two or more defined regions overlap, the region defined first takes
precedence (i.e., responds to user input).

Note: MAP is not backwards compatible with HTML 2.0 user agents.

Client-side image maps for OBJECT with shapes

Attribute definitions

shapes
     When set, this boolean attribute specifies that the element has an
     image map and that its contents must contain the geometric descriptions
     of the active regions.

The second way to specify a client-side image map for an OBJECT element is
for the author to set the shapes attribute and then to define the image map
within the element's content. Each region of the image map is specified by a
link (the A element) that has an associated geometric shape (via the shape
attribute). The presence of the shapes attribute implies that user agents
must parse the contents of the element to look for anchors.

In the following example, we create a client-side image map for the OBJECT
element by associating URLs with regions specified by a series of A
elements.

<OBJECT data="navbar.gif" shapes>
 <A href="guide.html" shape="rect" coords="0,0,118,28">Access Guide</a> |
 <A href="shortcut.html" shape="rect" coords="118,0,184,28">Go</A> |
 <A href="search.html" shape="circ" coords="184,200,60">Search</A> |
 <A href="top10.html" shape="poly" coords="276,0,373,28,50,50,276,0">Top Ten</A>
</OBJECT>

14.5.2 Server-side image maps

Server-side image maps may be interesting in cases where the image map is
too complicated for a client-side image map.

It is only possible to define a server-side image map for the IMG and INPUT
elements (using MAP and AREA).

In the case of IMG, the IMG must be enclosed by an A element.

In the case of INPUT, the INPUT must be of type "image".

In both cases, the boolean attribute ismap on the element must be set.

When the user activates the link by clicking on the image, the screen
coordinates are sent directly to the server where the document resides.
Screen coordinates are expressed as screen pixel values relative to the
image. For normative information about the definition of a pixel and how to
scale it, please consult [CSS1].

In the following example, the active region defines a server-side link.
Thus, a click anywhere on the image will cause the click's coordinates to be
sent to the server.

  <A href="http://www.acme.com/cgi-bin/competition">
        <IMG src="game.gif" ismap></A>

The location clicked is passed to the server as follows. The user agent
derives a new URL from the URL specified by the href attribute of the A
element, by appending `?' followed by the x and y coordinates, separated by
a comma. The link is then followed using the new URL. For instance, in the
given example, if the user clicks at at the location x=10, y=27 then the
derived URL is "http://www.acme.com/cgi-bin/competition?10,27".

14.6 Visual presentation of images, objects, and applets

All IMG and OBJECT attributes that concern visual alignment and presentation
have been deprecated in favor of style sheets.

14.6.1 Width and height

When specified, the height and width attributes for the IMG, APPLET, and
OBJECT elements tell user agents to override the natural image size and
scale the image to this width and height.

Both attributes take values of type length. User agents should do their best
to scale an object or image to match the width and height specified by the
author.

At the same time, the height and width attributes give user agents an idea
of the size of an image or object so that they may reserve space for it and
continue rendering the document while waiting for the image data.

14.6.2 White space around images and objects

The vspace and hspace attributes specify the amount of white space to be
inserted to the left and right (hspace) and above and below (vspace) an IMG,
APPLET, OBJECT. The default value for these attributes is not specified, but
is generally a small, non-zero length. Both attributes take values of type
length.

14.6.3 Borders

An image or object may be surrounded by a border (e.g., when a border is
specified by the user or when the image is the content of an A element).

The border attribute specifies the width of this border in pixels. The
default value for this attribute depends on the user agent.

14.6.4 Alignment

The align attribute specifies the position of an IMG, OBJECT, or APPLET with
respect to its context.

The following values for align concern the object's position with respect to
surrounding text:

   * bottom: means that the bottom of the object should be vertically
     aligned with the current baseline. This is the default value.
   * middle: means that the center of the object should be vertically
     aligned with the current baseline.
   * top: means that the top of the object should be vertically aligned with
     the top of the current text line.

Two other values, left and right, cause the image to float to the current
left or right margin. They are discussed in the section on floating objects.

Differing interpretations of align. User agents vary in their interpretation
of the align attribute. Some only take into account what has occurred on the
text line prior to the element, some take into account the text on both
sides of the element.

14.7 How to specify alternate text

Attribute definitions

alt = cdata
     For user agents that cannot display images, forms, or applets, this
     attribute specifies alternate text. The language of the alternate text
     is specified by the lang attribute.

Several non-textual elements (IMG, AREA, APPLET, and INPUT) require authors
to specify alternate text to serve as content when the element cannot be
rendered normally. Specifying alternate text assists users without graphic
display terminals, users whose browsers don't support forms, visually
impaired users, those who use speech synthesizers, those who have configured
their graphical user agents not to display images, etc.

The alt attribute must be specified for the IMG and AREA elements. It is
optional for the INPUT and APPLET elements.

While alternate text may be very helpful, it must be handled with care.
Authors should observe the following guidelines:

   * Do not specify meaningless alternate text when including images
     intended to format a page. In this case, the alternate text should be
     the empty string (""). In any case, authors should not use images to
     format pages; style sheets should be used instead.
   * Do not specify meaningless alternate text (e.g., "dummy text"). Not
     only will this frustrate users, it will slow down user agents that must
     convert text to speech or braille output.

Implementors should consult the section on generating alternate text for
information about how to handle cases of omitted alternate text.

                               15 Style Sheets

Contents

  1. Adding style to HTML
       1. Setting the default style sheet language
       2. Inline style information
       3. Header style information: the STYLE element
       4. Media types
       5. External style sheets
       6. Setting the default named style
       7. Media-dependent cascades
  2. Inheritance and cascading
  3. Hiding the Content of Style Elements from non-conforming User Agents
  4. Specifying style through HTTP headers

Style sheets represent a major breakthrough in how Web page designers work,
by expanding their ability to improve the appearance of their pages. In the
scientific environments in which the Web was conceived, people are more
concerned with the content of their documents than the presentation. As
people from wider walks of life discovered the Web, the limitations of HTML
became a source of continuing frustration. These authors were used to paper
media where they had full control. They learned how to sidestep HTML's
stylistic limitations. While the intentions have been good - to improve the
presentation of Web pages - the techniques for doing so have had unfortunate
side effects. These techniques work for some of the people, some of the
time, but never for all of the people, all of the time, They include:

   * Using proprietary HTML extensions
   * Converting text into images
   * Using images for white space control
   * Use of tables for page layout
   * Writing a program instead of using HTML

These techniques considerably increase the complexity of Web pages, have
limited flexibility as well as suffering from interoperability problems, and
creating hardships for people with disabilities.

Style sheets bring back the ease of control over presentation, and supersede
the limited range of presentation mechanisms added to HTML over the last few
years. Style sheets make it easy to specify the amount of white space
between text lines, the amount lines are indented, the colors used for the
text and the backgrounds, the font size and style, and a host of other
details.

HTML 4.0 provides support for the following features:

Flexible placement of Style Information
     Placing style sheets in separate files makes them easy to reuse.
     Sometimes its useful to include rendering instructions within the
     document to which they apply, either grouped at the start of the
     document, or in attributes of the elements throughout the body of the
     document. To make it easier to manage style on a site basis, this
     specification describes how to use HTTP headers to set the style sheets
     to be applied to a document.
Independence from specific style sheet languages
     This specification doesn't tie HTML to any particular style sheet
     language. This allows for a range of such languages to be used, for
     instance simple ones for the majority of users and much more complex
     ones for the minority of users with highly specialized needs. The
     examples included below all use the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
     language [CSS1], but other style sheet languages would be possible.
Cascading Style Sheets
     This is the capability provided by some style sheet languages such as
     CSS to allow style information from several sources to be blended
     together. For instance, corporate style guidelines, styles common to a
     group of documents, and styles specific to a single document. By
     storing these separately, style sheets can be reused, simplifying
     authoring and making more effective use of network caching. The cascade
     defines an ordered sequence of style sheets where rules in later sheets
     have greater precedence than earlier ones. Not all style sheet
     languages support cascading.
Media Dependencies
     HTML allows authors to specify documents in a media-independent way.
     This allows users to access Web pages using a wide variety of devices
     and media, e.g., graphical displays for computers running Windows,
     Macintosh OS, and X11, set-top boxes for television sets, specially
     adapted phones and PDA based portable devices, speech-based browsers,
     and braille-based tactical devices.

     Style sheets, by contrast, apply to specific media or media groups. A
     style sheet intended for screen use, may be applicable when printing,
     but is of little use for speech-based browsers. This specification
     allows you to define the broad categories of media a given style sheet
     is applicable to. This allows user agents to avoid retrieving
     inappropriate style sheets. Style sheet languages may include features
     for describing media dependencies within the same style sheet.
Alternative Styles
     Authors may wish to offer readers several alternative styles for
     viewing a document. For instance, a compact version with small fonts,
     and one with larger fonts for increased legibility. This specification
     allows you to specify such alternatives, including which one is the
     default. Users should be given the opportunity of selecting between
     these styles or switching off style sheets altogether.
Performance Concerns
     Some people have voiced concerns over performance issues for style
     sheets. For instance, retrieving an external style sheet may delay the
     full presentation for the user. A similar situation arises if the
     document head includes a lengthy set of style rules.

     The current proposal addresses these issues by allowing authors to
     include rendering instructions within each HTML element. The rendering
     information is then always available by the time the user agent wants
     to render each element.

     In many cases, authors will take advantage of a common style sheet for
     a group of documents. In this case, distributing style rules throughout
     the document will actually lead to worse performance than using a
     linked style sheet, since for most documents, the style sheet will
     already be present in the local cache. The public availability of good
     style sheets will encourage this effect.

15.1 Adding style to HTML

HTML documents may contain style sheet rules directly in them or they may
import style sheets. Any style sheet language may be used with HTML. A
simple style sheet language may suffice for the needs of most users, but
languages may be more suited to highly specialized needs. HTML does not
depend on one specific style sheet language. For the purposes of this
document, however, we will present examples that illustrate Cascading Style
Sheets ([CSS1]), abbreviated CSS.

15.1.1 Setting the default style sheet language

The syntax of a style rule is that of the style sheet language, not HTML.
Since user agents that support style sheets must parse these rules, users
must declare which style sheet languages are being employed.

Use the META element to set the default style sheet language for a document.
For example, to set the default to CSS, put the following declaration in the
HEAD of your document:

<META http-equiv="Content-Style-Type" content="text/css">

The default style sheet language can also be set with HTTP headers. The
above META declaration is equivalent to the HTTP header:

Content-Style-Type: text/css

If two or more META declarations or HTTP headers specify the default style
sheet language, the last one takes precedence. HTTP headers are considered
as occurring earlier than the document HEAD for this purpose. In the absence
of an explicit declaration, the default style sheet language is assumed to
be CSS. However, it is recommended that authoring tools provide an explicit
declaration.

Conforming HTML parsers must be able to distinguish HTML from style sheet
rules. HTML elements and attributes define the beginning of style sheet
data. The end of style sheet data is defined as the end tag open delimiter
(</) immediately followed by an SGML name start character ([a-zA-Z]). All
style sheet data must be provided to user agent's appropriate style sheet
handler.

15.1.2 Inline style information

Attribute definitions

style = cdata
     This attribute specifies style information for the current element.

The style attribute specifies style information for a single element. The
style information is specified using the default style sheet language.

This example sets color and font size information for the text in a specific
paragraph.

<P style="font-size: 12pt; color: fuchsia">Aren't style sheets wonderful?

Note the syntax of a CSS declaration: name : value. Property declarations
are separated by a semi-colon.

The style attribute is appropriate when you want to apply a particular style
to an individual HTML element. If the style will be reused for several
elements, you should consider using the STYLE element. For the best
flexibility, place styles in separate style sheets.

15.1.3 Header style information: the STYLE element

<!ELEMENT STYLE - - CDATA      -- style info -->
<!ATTLIST STYLE
  %i18n;                           -- lang, dir, for use with title --
  type        CDATA      #REQUIRED -- Internet content type
                                      for style language --
  media       CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- designed for use with these media --
  title       CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- advisory title --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

Attribute definitions

type = cdata
     This attribute specifies the style sheet language of the element's
     contents, thus overriding the default style sheet language. The style
     sheet language is specified as an Internet Media Type (e.g.,
     "text/css"). Internet Media Types are defined in [MIMETYPES].
media = cdata-list
     This attribute specifies the intended destination medium for style
     information. It may be a single media descriptor or a comma-separated
     list.

     Possible media descriptors:

        o screen: intended primarily for non-paged computer screens, but
          also applicable to printed and projected presentations. This is
          the default value.
        o print: intended for paged, opaque material and for documents
          viewed on screen in print preview mode.
        o projection: intended for projectors.
        o braille: intended for braille tactile feedback devices.
        o aural: intended for speech synthesizers.
        o all: suitable for all devices.

     In the future, there may be more values, and each value may have
     associated with parameters. To enable the smooth introduction of such
     extensions, user agents conforming to this specification must be able
     to parse the media attribute value as follows:

       1. Comma characters (Unicode decimal 44) are used to break the media
          attribute value into a list of entries, e.g.:

          media="screen, 3d-glasses, print and resolution > 90dpi"

          is mapped to:

          "screen"
          "3d-glasses"
          "print and resolution > 90dpi"

       2. Each entry is truncated just before the first character which
          isn't a US ASCII letter [a-zA-Z] (Unicode decimal 65-90, 97-122),
          or hyphen (45) . In the example, this gives:

          "screen"
          "3d-glasses"
          "print"

       3. A case-sensitive match is then made with the set of media types
          defined above. Entries that don't match should be ignored. In the
          example we are left with screen and print.

Note. Style sheets may include media dependent variations within them (e.g.,
the proposed CSS @media construct). In such cases it may be appropriate to
use the default "media=all".

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)

The STYLE element allows authors to put style sheet rules in the header of
the document. HTML permits any number of STYLE elements in the HEAD section
of a document.

User agents that don't support style sheets, or don't support the specific
style sheet language used by a STYLE element must hide the contents of the
STYLE element. It is an error to render the content as part of the
document's text. Some style sheet languages support syntax for hiding the
content from non-conforming user agents.

Some style sheet implementations may allow a wider variety of rules in the
STYLE element than in the style attribute. For example, with CSS, rules may
be declared within a STYLE element for:

   * All instances of a specific HTML element (e.g., all P elements, all H1
     elements, etc.)
   * All instances of an HTML element belonging to a specific class (i.e.,
     whose class attribute is set to some value).
   * Single instances of an HTML element (i.e., whose id attribute is set to
     some value).

Rules for style rule precedences and inheritance depend on the style sheet
language.

The following CSS STYLE declaration puts a border around every H1 element in
the document and centers it on the page.

<HEAD>
 <STYLE type="text/css">
   H1 {border-width: 1; border: solid; text-align: center}
 </STYLE>
</HEAD>

To specify that this style information should only apply to H1 elements of a
specific class, we modify it as follows:

<HEAD>
 <STYLE type="text/css">
   H1.myclass {border-width: 1; border: solid; text-align: center}
 </STYLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
 <H1 class="myclass"> This H1 is affected by our style </H1>
 <H1> This one is not affected by our style </H1>
</BODY>

Finally, to limit the scope of the style information to a single instance of
H1, set the id attribute:

<HEAD>
 <STYLE type="text/css">
   #myid {border-width: 1; border: solid; text-align: center}
 </STYLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
 <H1 class="myclass"> This H1 is not affected </H1>
 <H1 id="myid"> This H1 is affected by style </H1>
 <H1> This H1 is not affected </H1>
</BODY>

Although style information may be set for almost every HTML element, two
elements are particularly useful in that they do not impose any predefined
presentation. Since DIV and SPAN elements define structure only, when
combined with style sheets, they allow users to extend HTML indefinitely.

In the following example, we use the SPAN element to set the font style of
the first few words of a paragraph to small caps.

<HEAD>
 <STYLE type="text/css">
  SPAN.sc-ex { font-variant: small-caps }
 </STYLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
  <P><SPAN class="sc-ex">The first</SPAN> few words of
  this paragraph are in small-caps.
</BODY>

In the following example, we use DIV and the class attribute to set the text
justification for a series of paragraphs that make up the abstract section
of a scientific article. This style information could be reused for other
abstract sections by setting the class attribute elsewhere in the document.

<HEAD>
 <STYLE type="text/css">
   DIV.Abstract { text-align: justify }
 </STYLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
 <DIV class="Abstract">
   <P>The Chieftain product range is our market winner for
     the coming year. This report sets out how to position
     Chieftain against competing products.

   <P>Chieftain replaces the Commander range, which will
     remain on the price list until further notice.
 </DIV>
</BODY>

15.1.4 Media types

HTML enables authors to create documents that can be rendered on a variety
of media. For instance: graphical displays for personal computers and
workstations, set-top boxes for televisions, specially adapted telephones
and handheld wireless devices, speech-based browsers, and braille-based
tactile devices. The media attribute specifies which media the style rules
are appropriate for.

The following sample declarations apply to H1 elements. When projected in a
business meeting, all instances will be blue. When printed, all instances
will be centered.

<HEAD>
 <STYLE type="text/css" media="projection">
    H1 { color: blue}
 </STYLE>

 <STYLE type="text/css" media="print">
   H1 { text-align: center }
 </STYLE>

This example adds sound effects to anchors for use in speech output:

 <STYLE type="text/acss" media="aural">
   A { cue-before: url(bell.aiff); cue-after: url(dong.wav)}
 </STYLE>
</HEAD>

Media control is particularly interesting when applied to external style
sheets since user agents can save time by retrieving from the network only
those style sheets that apply to the current device. For instance,
speech-based browsers can avoid downloading style sheets designed for visual
rendering. See the section on media dependent cascades for more information.

15.1.5 External style sheets

Style sheets may be defined separately from an HTML document. This has the
advantage of offering the ability:

   * to share style sheets across a number of documents (and sites)
   * to change the style sheet without modifications to the document

When style sheets are enabled, users may be offered a choice of styles. Each
style is potentially a cascade of several style sheets. Some style sheets
(known as persistent) are applied independently of the user's choice (as
long as it refers to the correct media type), while others (known as
alternate) only apply to specific choices. A default style sheet is one that
applies when the page is loaded, but which the user can disable in favor of
an alternate style sheet.

Use the LINK element to designate an external style sheet. You must set the
following attributes:

   * Set the value of href to the location of the style sheet file. The
     value of href is a URL.
   * Set the value of the rel attribute to indicate whether the style sheet
     is persistent (rel="stylesheet"), default (rel="stylesheet"), or
     alternate (rel="alternate stylesheet").
   * Set the value of the title attribute when the style sheet is a default
     style sheet, i.e., when it may be activated or deactivated by the user.

In this example, we first specify a persistent external style sheet in the
file mystyle.css.

<LINK href="mystyle.css" rel="stylesheet">

Setting the title attribute changes the style sheet from persistent to
default; user agents should offer users the possibility of applying named
styles, based upon the title attribute.

<LINK href="mystyle.css" title="Compact" rel="stylesheet">

Adding the keyword "alternate" to the rel attribute makes this an alternate
style sheet.

<LINK href="mystyle.css" title="Medium" rel="alternate stylesheet">

All alternate styles sharing the same title will be applied when the user
(through the user agent) activates that style. Style sheets with different
titles will not be applied in this case. However, style sheets that do not
have the title attribute set will always apply (unless the user turns off
style sheets altogether).

User agents should provide a means for users to view and pick from the list
of alternative styles. The value of the title attribute is recommended as
the name of each choice.

Cascading style sheet languages such as CSS allow style information from
several sources to be blended together. However, not all style sheet
languages support cascading. To define a cascade you simply provide a
sequence of LINK and/or STYLE elements. The style information is cascaded in
the order the elements appear in the HEAD.

In the following example, we define two alternate style sheets named
"compact". If the user selects the "compact" style, both external style
sheets will be applied, as well as the "common.css" style sheet, (always
applied since its title attribute is not set). If the user selects the "big
print" style, the files "bigprint.css" and "common.css" will be applied by
the user agent, and the "compact" style sheets will not.

<LINK rel="alternate stylesheet" title="compact" href="small-base.css">
<LINK rel="alternate stylesheet" title="compact" href="small-extras.css">
<LINK rel="alternate stylesheet" title="big print" href="bigprint.css">
<LINK rel=stylesheet href="common.css">

Here is an example with both LINK and STYLE elements.

<LINK rel="stylesheet" href="corporate.css">
<LINK rel="stylesheet" href="techreport.css">
<STYLE type="text/css">
    p.special { color: rgb(230, 100, 180) }
</STYLE>

15.1.6 Setting the default named style

Use the META element to set the default named style for a document. For
example, to set the default named style in a document to "compact" (see the
preceding example), include the following line in the HEAD:

<META http-equiv="Default-Style" content="compact">

The default style can also be set with HTTP headers. The above META
declaration is equivalent to the HTTP header:

Default-Style: "compact"

If two or more META declarations or HTTP headers specify the default style,
the last one takes precedence. HTTP headers are considered as occurring
earlier than the document HEAD for this purpose. In the absence of an
explicit declaration, the default style is defined by the first LINK element
whose title has been set and whose rel attribute has the value "stylesheet".

15.1.7 Media-dependent cascades

A cascade may include style sheets applicable to different media. Both LINK
and STYLE may be used with the media attribute. The user agent is then
responsible to filtering out those style sheets that are inapplicable to the
current situation.

In the following example, the author has defined a cascade where the
"corporate" style sheet is provided in several versions: one suited to
printing, one for screen use and one for speech-based browsers (useful, say,
when reading email in the car). The print version is placed after the screen
version so that its rules will take precedence when printing. The
"techreport" stylesheet and the rules defined by the STYLE element are used
for print and screen but not for aural rendering.

<LINK rel="stylesheet" media="aural" href="corporate-screen.css">
<LINK rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="corporate-screen.css">
<LINK rel="stylesheet" media="print" href="corporate-print.css">
<LINK rel="stylesheet" href="techreport.css">
<STYLE type="text/css">
    p.special { color: rgb(230, 100, 180) }
</STYLE>

15.2 Inheritance and cascading

When the user agent wants to render a document, it needs to find values for
style properties, e.g. the font family, font style, size, line height, text
color and so on. The exact mechanism depends on the style sheet language,
but the following description is generally applicable:

The cascading mechanism is used when a number of style rules all apply
directly to an element. The mechanism allows the user agent to sort the
rules by specificity, to determine which rule to apply. If no rule can be
found, the next step depends on whether the style property can be inherited
or not. Not all properties can be inherited. For these properties the style
sheet language provides default values for use when there are no explicit
rules for a particular element.

If the property can be inherited, the user agent examines the immediately
enclosing element to see if a rule applies to that. This process continues
until an applicable rule is found. This mechanism allows style sheets to be
specified compactly. For instance, you can specify the font family for all
elements within the BODY by a single rule that applies to the BODY element.

15.3 Hiding the Content of Style Elements from non-conforming User Agents

Some style sheet languages support syntax intended to allow authors to hide
the content of STYLE elements from non-conforming user agents.

This example illustrates for CSS how to comment out the content of STYLE
elements to ensure that older non-conforming user agents will not render
them as text.

<STYLE type="text/css">
<!--
   H1 { color: red }
   P  { color: blue}
   -->
</STYLE>

15.4 Specifying style through HTTP headers

Sometimes its convenient to configure a Web server to specify the style
sheet to be applied to a group of pages at a site. The HTTP Link header
described in [RFC2068] has the same effect as a LINK element with the same
attributes and values. Multiple Link headers correspond to multiple LINK
elements occurring in the same order. For instance,

Link: <http://www.acme.com/corporate.css>; REL=stylesheet

corresponds to:

<LINK rel="stylesheet" href="http://www.acme.com/corporate.css">

You can specify several alternative styles, using multiple Link headers, and
then use the rel attribute to determine the default style.

In the following example, "compact" is applied by default since it omits the
"alternate" keyword for the rel attribute.

Link: <compact.css>; rel="stylesheet"; title="compact"
Link: <bigprint.css>; rel="alternate stylesheet"; title="big print"

This should also work when HTML documents are being by transported via
email. Some email agents can alter the ordering of [RFC822] headers. To
protect against this affecting the cascading order for style sheets
specified by Link headers, you can use header concatenation to merge several
instances of the same header field. The quote marks are only needed when the
attribute values include whitespace. Use SGML entities to reference
characters that are otherwise not permitted within HTTP or email headers, or
that are likely to be affected by transit through gateways.

LINK and META elements implied by HTTP headers are defined as occurring
before any explicit LINK and META elements in the document's HEAD.

          elements
       2. Font modifier elements: FONT and BASEFONT
  3. Rules: the HR element

This section of the specification discusses some HTML elements and
attributes that may be used for visual formatting. Generally speaking you
are recommended to use style sheets instead. An exception is when dealing
with user agents that either don't support style sheets or which don't
support the particular style sheet features needed. A number of HTML 4.0
elements and attributes dealing with visual presentation are deprecated and
may become obsolete in future versions of HTML.

16.1 Formatting

16.1.1 Background color

Attribute definitions

bgcolor = color
     Deprecated.This attribute sets the background color for the document
     body or table cells.

This attribute sets the background color of the canvas for the document body
(the BODY element) or for tables (the TABLE, TR, TH, and TD elements).
Additional attributes for specifying text color can be used with the BODY
element.

This attribute has been deprecated in favor of style sheets for specifying
background color information.

16.1.2 Alignment

It is possible to align block elements on the canvas (tables, images,
objects, paragraphs, etc.) with the align element. Although this attribute
may be set for many HTML elements, its range of possible values sometimes
differs from element to element.

Attribute definitions

align = left|center|right|justify
     Deprecated. This attribute specifies the horizontal alignment of its
     element with respect to the surrounding context. Possible values:
        o left: text lines are rendered flush left.
        o center: text lines are centered.
        o right: text lines are rendered flush right.
        o justify: text lines are justified to both margins.

The default depends on the base text direction. For left to right text, the
default is align=left, while for right to left text, the default is
align=right.

DEPRECATED EXAMPLE:
This example centers a heading on the canvas.

<H1 align="center"> How to Carve Wood </H1>

Using cascading style sheets, for example, you could achieve the same effect
as follows:

<HEAD>
 <STYLE>
  H1 { text-align: center}
 </STYLE>
<BODY>
 <H1> How to Carve Wood </H1>

Note that this would center all H1 declarations. You could reduce the scope
of the style by setting the class attribute on the element:

<HEAD>
 <STYLE type="text/css">
  H1.wood {text-align: center}
 </STYLE>
<BODY>
 <H1 class="wood"> How to Carve Wood </H1>

Similarly, to right align a paragraph on the canvas with HTML's align
attribute:

<P align="right">...Lots of paragraph text...

which, in cascading style sheets, would be:

<HEAD>
 <STYLE type="text/css">
  P.mypar {text-align: right}
 </STYLE>
<BODY>
 <P class="mypar">...Lots of paragraph text...

To right align a series of paragraphs, group them with the DIV element:

<DIV align="right">
 <P>...text in first paragraph...
 <P>...text in second paragraph...
 <P>...text in third paragraph...
</DIV>

With CSS, the text-align property is inherited from the parent element, you
can therefore use:

<HEAD>
 <STYLE type="text/css">
  DIV.mypars {text-align: right}
 </STYLE>
<BODY>
 <DIV class="mypars">
  <P>...text in first paragraph...
  <P>...text in second paragraph...
  <P>...text in third paragraph...
 </DIV>

To center the entire document with cascading style sheets:

<HEAD>
 <STYLE type="text/css">
  BODY {text-align: center}
 </STYLE>
<BODY>
 ...the body is centered...
</BODY>

The CENTER element is exactly equivalent to specifying the DIV element with
the align attribute set to "center". The CENTER element is deprecated.

16.1.3 Floating objects

Images and objects may appear directly "in-line" or may be floated to one
side of the page, temporarily altering the margins of text that may flow on
either side of the object.

Float an object

The align attribute for object, images, tables, frames, etc., causes the
object to float to the left or right margin. Floating objects generally
begin a new line. This attribute takes the following values:

   * left: Floats the object to the current left margin. Subsequent text
     flows along the image's right side.
   * right: Floats the object to the current right margin. Subsequent text
     flows along the image's left side.

The following example shows how to float an IMG element to the current left
margin of the canvas.

<IMG align="left" src="http://foo.com/animage.gif">

Some alignment attributes also permit the "center" value, which does not
cause floating, but centers the the object within the current margins.
However, for P and DIV, the value "center" causes the contents of the
element to be centered.

Float text around an object

Another attribute, defined for the BR element, controls text flow around
floating objects.

Attribute definitions

clear = none|left|right|all
     Specifies where the next line should appear in a visual browser after
     the line break caused by this element. This attribute takes into
     account floating objects (images, tables, etc.). Possible values:
        o none: The next line will begin normally. This is the default
          value.
        o left: The next line will begin at nearest line below any floating
          objects on the left-hand margin.
        o right: The next line will begin at nearest line below any floating
          objects on the right-hand margin.
        o all: The next line will begin at nearest line below any floating
          objects on either margin.

Consider the following visual scenario, where text flows to the right of an
image until a line is broken by a BR:

*********  -------
|       |  -------
| image |  --<BR>
|       |
*********

If the clear attribute is set to none, the line following BR will begin
immediately below it at the right margin of the image:

*********  -------
|       |  -------
| image |  --<BR>
|       |  ------
*********

If the clear attribute is set to left or all, next line will appear as
follows:

*********  -------
|       |  -------
| image |  --<BR clear="left">
|       |
*********
-----------------

Using style sheets, you could specify that all line breaks should behave
this way for objects (images, tables, etc.) floating against the left
margin. In cascading style sheets, you could achieve this as follows:

<STYLE type="text/css">
BR {clear: left}
</STYLE>

To specify this behavior for a specific instance of the BR element, you
could combine style information and the id attribute:

<HEAD>
...
<STYLE type="text/css">
BR.mybr {clear: left}
</STYLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
...
*********  -------
|       |  -------
| table |  --<BR id="mybr">
|       |
*********
-----------------
...
</BODY>

16.2 Fonts

The following HTML elements specify font information. Although they are not
all deprecated, their use is discouraged in favor of style sheets.

16.2.1 Font style elements: the TT, I, B, BIG, SMALL, STRIKE, S, and U
elements

<!ENTITY % fontstyle
 "TT | I | B | U | S | STRIKE | BIG | SMALL">
<!ELEMENT (%fontstyle;|%phrase;) - - (%inline;)*>
<!ATTLIST (%fontstyle;|%phrase;)
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information)
   * onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove,
     onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown onkeyup (intrinsic events)

Rendering of font style elements depends on the user agent. The following is
an informative description only.

     TT: Renders as teletype or monospaced text.
     I: Renders as italic text style.
     B: Renders as bold text style.
     BIG: Renders text in a "large" font.
     SMALL: Renders text in a "small" font.
     STRIKE and S: Deprecated. Render strike-through style text.
     U: Deprecated. Renders underlined text.

The following sentence shows several types of text:

<b>bold</b>,
<i>italic</i>, <b><i>bold italic</i></b>, <tt>teletype text</tt>, and
<big>big</big> and <small>small</small> text.

Your browser renders the words as follows:

     bold, italic, bold italic, teletype text, and big and small text.

It is possible to achieve a much richer variety of font effects using style
sheets. To specify blue, italic text in a paragraph with cascading style
sheets:

<HEAD>
<STYLE>
P.mypar {font-style: italic; color: blue}
</STYLE>
</HEAD>
<P id="mypar">...Lots of blue italic text...

Font style elements may be nested and they must be properly nested.
Rendering of nested font style elements depends on the user agent.

16.2.2 Font modifier elements: FONT and BASEFONT

FONT and BASEFONT are deprecated.

<!ELEMENT FONT - - (%inline;)*  -- local change to font -->
<!ATTLIST FONT
  %coreattrs;                      -- id, class, style, title --
  size        CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- [+]nn e.g. size="+1", size=4 --
  color       CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- #RRGGBB in hex, e.g. red: "#FF0000" --
  face        CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- comma separated list of font names --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

<!ELEMENT BASEFONT - O EMPTY -- base font size -->
<!ATTLIST BASEFONT
  id          ID         #IMPLIED  -- document-wide unique id --
  size       CDATA      #REQUIRED -- base font size for FONT elements --
  color       CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- #RRGGBB in hex, e.g. red: "#FF0000" --
  face        CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- comma separated list of font names --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: forbidden

Attribute definitions

size = cdata
     Deprecated. This attribute sets the size of the font. Possible values:
        o An integer between 1 and 7. This sets the font to some fixed size,
          whose rendering depends on the user agent. Not all user agents may
          render all seven sizes.
        o A relative increase in font size. The value "+1" means one size
          larger. The value "-3" means three sizes smaller. All sizes belong
          to the scale of 1 to 7.
color = color
     Deprecated. This attribute sets the text color.
face = cdata-list
     Deprecated. This attribute defines a comma-separated list of font names
     the user agent should search for in order of preference.

The FONT element changes the font size and color for text in its contents.

The BASEFONT element sets the base font size (using the size attribute).
Font size changes achieved with FONT are relative to the base font size set
by BASEFONT. If BASEFONT is not used, the default base font size is 3.

DEPRECATED EXAMPLE:
The following example will show the difference between the seven font sizes
available with FONT:

<P><font size=1>size=1</font>
<font size=2>size=2</font>
<font size=3>size=3</font>
<font size=4>size=4</font>
<font size=5>size=5</font>
<font size=6>size=6</font>
<font size=7>size=7</font>

Your user agent renders this as follows:

size=1 size=2 size=3 size=4 size=5 size=6 size=7

The following shows the effect of relative font sizes using a base font size
of 3:

size=-4 size=-3 size=-2 size=-1 size=+1 size=+2 size=+3 size=+4

The same thing with a base font size of 6:

size=-4 size=-3 size=-2 size=-1 size=+1 size=+2 size=+3 size=+4

The base font size does not apply to headings, except where these are
modified using the FONT element with a relative font size change.

16.3 Rules: the HR element

<!ELEMENT HR - O EMPTY -- horizontal rule -->
<!ATTLIST HR
  %coreattrs;                      -- id, class, style, title --
  %events;
  align (left|right|center) #IMPLIED
  noshade     (noshade)  #IMPLIED
  size        %Pixels;   #IMPLIED
  width       %Length;   #IMPLIED
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: forbidden

Attribute definitions

noshade
     When set, this boolean attribute requests that the user agent render
     the rule in a solid color rather than as the traditional two-color
     "groove".
size = length
     Deprecated. This attribute specifies the height of the rule. The
     default value for this attribute depends on the user agent.
width = length
     Deprecated. This attribute specifies the width of the rule. The default
     width is 100%, i.e., the rule extends across the entire canvas.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * align (alignment)
   * onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove,
     onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup (intrinsic events)

The HR element causes a horizontal rule to be rendered by visual user
agents.

The amount of vertical space inserted between a rule and the content that
surrounds it depends on the user agent.

DEPRECATED EXAMPLE:
This example centers the rules, sizing them to half the available width
between the margins. The top rule has the default thickness while the bottom
two are set to 5 pixels. The bottom rule should be rendered in a solid color
without shading:

<HR width="50%" align="center">
<HR size="5" width="50%" align="center">
<HR noshade size="5" width="50%" align="center">

Your browser renders these rules as follows:
                   --------------------------------------
                   --------------------------------------
                   --------------------------------------

       1. The NOFRAMES element
  4. Inline frames: the IFRAME element

HTML frames allow authors to present documents in multiple views. Views may
be independent windows or subwindows. Multiple views offer designers a way
to keep certain information visible, while other views are scrolled or
replaced. For instance, to use three frames: one for a static banner, one
for a navigation menu, and one for a main view that can be scrolled though
or replaced by clicking on an item in the navigation frame.

17.1 Layout of frames

An HTML document with frames has a different makeup than an HTML document
without frames. A standard document has one HEAD section and one BODY. A
document with frames has a HEAD, and a FRAMESET in place of the BODY.

The FRAMESET section of a document specifies the layout of views in the main
user agent window.

In addition, the FRAMESET section can contain a NOFRAMES element to provide
alternate content for user agents that do not support frames or are
configured not to display frames. We discuss alternate content in more
detail below.

Elements that might normally be placed in the BODY element must not appear
before the first FRAMESET element or the FRAMESET will be ignored.

17.1.1 The FRAMESET element

<![ %HTML.Frameset; [
<!ELEMENT FRAMESET - - ((FRAMESET|FRAME)+ & NOFRAMES?)
  -- window subdivision -->
<!ATTLIST FRAMESET
  id          ID         #IMPLIED  -- document-wide unique id --
  title       CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- advisory title as for anchors --
  -- absolute pixel values, percentages or relative scales. --
  rows        CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- if not given, default is 1 row --
  cols        CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- if not given, default is 1 column --
  onload      %Script;   #IMPLIED  -- all the frames have been loaded  --
  onunload    %Script;   #IMPLIED  -- all the frames have been removed --
  >
]]>

Start tag: required, End tag: required

Attribute definitions

rows = length-list
     This attribute specifies the layout of horizontal frames. It is a
     comma-separated list of lengths. If not specified, the default value is
     100%.
cols = length-list
     This attribute specifies the layout of vertical frames. It is a
     comma-separated list of lengths. If not specified, the default value is
     100%.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * onload, onunload (intrinsic events)

The FRAMESET element specifies the layout of the main user window in terms
of rectangular subspaces.

Rows and columns

Setting the rows attribute defines the number of horizontal subspaces.
Setting the cols attribute defines the number of vertical subspaces. Both
attributes may be set simultaneously to create a grid.

If the rows attribute is not set, each column extends the entire length of
the page. If the cols attribute is not set, each row extends the entire
width of the page. If neither attribute is set, the frame takes up exactly
the size of the page.

These two attributes have values that are comma-separated lists of lengths.
A length may be absolute (given as a number of pixels or a percentage of the
screen) or a relative length, indicated by the form "i*", where "i" is an
integer. When allotting space to rows and columns, user agents allot
absolute lengths first, then divide up remaining space among relative length
rows or columns. The value "*" is equivalent to "1*".

Views are created left-to-right for columns and top-to-bottom for rows. When
both attributes are specified, views are created left-to-right in the top
row, left-to-right in the second row, etc.

The first example divides the screen vertically in two (i.e., creates a top
half and a bottom half).

<FRAMESET rows="50%, 50%">
...the rest of the definition...
</FRAMESET>

The next example creates three columns: the second has a fixed width of 250
pixels (useful, for example, to hold an image with a known size). The first
receives 25% of the remaining space and the third 75% of the remaining
space.

<FRAMESET cols="1*,250,3*">
...the rest of the definition...
</FRAMESET>

The next example creates a 2x3 grid of subspaces.

<FRAMESET rows="30%,70%" cols="33%,34%,33%">
...the rest of the definition...
</FRAMESET>

For the next example, suppose the browser window is currently 1000 pixels
high. The first view is allotted 30% of the total height (300 pixels). The
second view is specified to be exactly 400 pixels high. This leaves 300
pixels to be divided between the other two frames. The fourth frame's height
is specified as "2*", so it is twice as high as the third frame, whose
height is only "*" (1*). Therefore the third frame will be 100 pixels high
and the fourth will be 200 pixels high.

<FRAMESET rows="30%,400,*,2*">
...the rest of the definition...
</FRAMESET>

Absolute lengths that do not sum to 100% of the real available space should
be adjusted by the user agent. When underspecified, remaining space should
be allotted proportionally to each view. When overspecified, each view
should be reduced according to its specified proportion of the total space.

Nested frame sets

Framesets may be nested to any level.

In the following example, the outer FRAMESET divides the available space
into three equal columns. The inner FRAMESET then divides the second area
into two rows of unequal height.

<FRAMESET cols="33%, 33%, 34%">
     ...contents of first frame...
     <FRAMESET rows="40%, 50%">
        ...contents of second frame, first row...
        ...contents of second frame, second row...
     </FRAMESET>
     ...contents of third frame...
</FRAMESET>

17.1.2 The FRAME element

Start tag: required, End tag: forbidden

Attribute definitions

name = cdata
     This attribute assigns a name to the current frame. This name may be
     the target of subsequent links.
src = url
     This attribute specifies the location of the initial document to be
     contained in the frame.
noresize
     When present, this boolean attribute tells the user agent that the
     frame window must not be resizeable.
scrolling = auto|yes|no
     This attribute specifies scroll information for the frame window.
     Possible values
        o auto: This value tells the user agent to provide scrolling devices
          for the frame window when necessary. This is the default value.
        o yes: This value tells the user agent to always provide scrolling
          devices for the frame window.
        o no: This value tells the user agent not to provide scrolling
          devices for the frame window.
frameborder = 1|0
     This attribute provides the user agent with information about the frame
     border. Possible values:
        o 1: This value tells the user agent to draw a separator between
          this frame and every adjoining frame. This is the default value.
        o 0: This value tells the user agent not to draw a separator between
          this frame and every adjoining frame. Note that separators may be
          drawn next to this frame nonetheless if specified by other frames.
marginwidth = length
     This attribute specifies the amount of space to be left between the
     frame's contents in its left and right margins. The value must be
     greater than one pixel. The default value depends on the user agent.
marginheight = length
     This attribute specifies the amount of space to be left between the
     frame's contents in its top and bottom margins. The value must be
     greater than one pixel. The default value depends on the user agent.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * target (target frame information)

The FRAME element defines the contents and appearance of a single view.

Setting the initial document in a frame

The src attribute specifies the initial document the frame will contain. It
is not possible for the contents of a frame to be in the same document as
the frame's definition.

The following example example HTML document:

<HTML>
<FRAMESET cols="33%,33%,33%">
  <FRAMESET rows="*,200">
      <FRAME src="contents_of_frame1.html">
      <FRAME src="contents_of_frame2.gif">
  </FRAMESET>
  <FRAME src="contents_of_frame3.html">
  <FRAME src="contents_of_frame4.html">
</FRAMESET>
</HTML>

will create a frame layout something like this:

--------------------------------------------
|Frame 1     |Frame 3       |Frame 4       |
|            |              |              |
|            |              |              |
|            |              |              |
|            |              |              |
|            |              |              |
|            |              |              |
|            |              |              |
-------------|              |              |
|Frame 2     |              |              |
|            |              |              |
|            |              |              |
--------------------------------------------

and cause the user agent to load each file into a separate view.

ILLEGAL EXAMPLE:
The following frameset definition is not legal HTML since the contents of
the second frame are in the same document as the frameset.

<HTML>
<FRAMESET cols="50%,50%">
  <FRAME src="contents_of_frame1.html">
  <FRAME src="#anchor_in_same_document">
  <NOFRAMES>
  ...some text...
  <H2><A name="anchor_in_same_document">Important section</A></H2>
  ...some text...
  </NOFRAMES>
</FRAMESET>
</HTML>

Decorating a frame

The following example illustrates the usage of the decorative FRAME
attributes. We specify that frame 1 will allow no scroll bars. Frame 2 will
leave white space around its contents (initially, an image file) and the
frame will not be resizeable. No border will be drawn between frames 3 and
4. Borders will be drawn (by default) between frames 1, 2, and 3.

<HTML>
<FRAMESET cols="33%,33%,33%">
  <FRAMESET rows="*,200">
      <FRAME src="contents_of_frame1.html" scrolling="no">
      <FRAME src="contents_of_frame2.gif"
                marginwidth="10" marginheight="15"
                noresize>
  </FRAMESET>
  <FRAME src="contents_of_frame3.html" border="0">
  <FRAME src="contents_of_frame4.html" border="0">
</FRAMESET>
</HTML>

17.2 Specifying target frame information

Attribute definitions

target = cdata
     This attribute specifies the name of a target frame where a document is
     to be opened.

By assigning a name to a frame via the name attribute, authors can refer to
it as the "target" of links defined by other elements. The target attribute
may be set for elements that create links (A, LINK), image maps (AREA), and
forms (FORM).

This example illustrates how targets allow the dynamic modification of a
frame's contents. First we define a frameset in the document frameset.html,
shown here:

<HTML>
<FRAMESET rows="50%,50%">
   <FRAME name="fixed" src="init_fixed.html">
   <FRAME name="dynamic" src="init_dynamic.html">
</FRAMESET>
</HTML>

Then, in init_dynamic.html, we link to the frame named "dynamic".

<HTML>
<BODY>
...beginning of the document...
Now you may advance to
    <A href="slide2.html" target="dynamic">slide 2.</A>
...more document...
You're doing great. Now on to
    <A href="slide3.html" target="dynamic">slide 3.</A>
</BODY>
</HTML>

Activating either link opens a new document in the frame named "dynamic"
while the other frame, "fixed", maintains its initial contents.

Note: Once a frame's content is changed dynamically, the original frameset
definition no longer reflects the true contents of each frame; the frameset
definition does not change.

There is currently no way to encode the entire state of a frameset in a URL.
Therefore, many user agents do not allow users to assign a bookmark to a
frameset.

Framesets may make navigation forward and backward through your user agent's
history more difficult for users.

17.2.1 Setting the default target for links

When many links in the same document designate the same target, it is
possible to specify the target once and dispense with the target attributes
in each element. This is done by setting the target attribute of the BASE
element.

We return to the previous example, this time factorizing the target
information by defining it in the BASE element and removing it from the A
elements.

<HTML>
<HEAD>
<BASE target="dynamic">
</HEAD>
<BODY>
...beginning of the document...
Now you may advance to <A href="slide2.html">slide 2.</A>
...more document...
You're doing great. Now on to
       <A href="slide3.html">slide 3.</A>
</BODY>
</HTML>

17.2.2 Target semantics

There are several methods for making a frame the target of a link. Here we
define their interaction.

  1. If an element has its target attribute set to a known frame, when the
     element is activated, the document designated by the element will be
     loaded into the target frame.
  2. If an element does not have the target attribute set but the BASE
     element does, the BASE element's target determines the frame, and
     loading obeys the same semantics as 1.
  3. If neither the element nor the BASE element refer to a target, the
     document designated by the element will be loaded into the frame
     containing the element.
  4. If any target refers to an unknown frame F, the user agent will create
     a new window and frame, assign the name F to the frame, and load the
     document designated by the element in the new frame.

User agents may provide users with a mechanism to override the target
attribute.

17.2.3 Target names

Except for the reserved names listed below, target names must begin with an
alphabetic character (a-zA-Z). User agents should ignore all other target
names.

The following target names are reserved and have special meanings.

_blank
     The user agent should load the designated document in a new, unnamed
     window.
_self
     The user agent should load the document in the same frame as the
     element that refers to this target.
_parent
     The user agent should load the document into the immediate FRAMESET
     parent of the current frame. This value is equivalent to _self if the
     current frame has no parent.
_top
     The user agent should load the document into the full, original window
     (thus cancelling all other frames). This value is equivalent to _self
     if the current frame has no parent.

17.3 Alternate content

We strongly recommend providing alternate versions of content for those user
agents that do not support frames or are configured not to display frames.

17.3.1 The NOFRAMES element

<![ %HTML.Frameset; [
<!ENTITY % noframes.content "BODY">
]]>

<!ENTITY % noframes.content "%block;">

<!ELEMENT NOFRAMES - - (%noframes.content;)
 -- alternate content container for non frame-based rendering -->
<!ATTLIST NOFRAMES
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

The NOFRAMES element specifies content that should be displayed only when
frames are not being displayed. User agents that support frames must only
display the contents of a NOFRAMES declaration when configured not to
display frames. User agents that do not support frames must display the
contents of NOFRAMES in any case.

NOFRAMES can be used either in the FRAMESET section of a frameset document
or directly in the BODY of a document used within a frameset.

Suppose we have a sample frameset defined in "top.html" that designates a
document ("main.html") and a special table of contents
("table_of_contents.html") related to the main document. Here is "top.html":

<HTML>
<FRAMESET cols="50%, 50%">
   <FRAME src="main.html">
   <FRAME src="table_of_contents.html">
</FRAMESET>
</HTML>

What happens when the user reads "top.html" and the user agent is not
displaying frames? The user won't see anything since we do not have a BODY
in "top.html". If we insert "table_of_contents.html" and "main.html"
directly in a NOFRAMES element in the FRAMESET, we solve the problem of
associating the two documents, but we may cause user agents that support
frames to retrieve the same data twice: one copy associated with the
frameset and one copy inserted in the NOFRAMES.

It is more economical to include the table of contents at the top of
"main.html" within a NOFRAMES element:

<!-- This is main.html -->
<HTML>
<BODY>
<NOFRAMES>
...the table of contents here...
</NOFRAMES>
...the rest of the document...
</BODY>
</HTML>

and to link to "main.html" from "top.html" for the case when frames are not
displayed:

<!-- This is top.html -->
<HTML>
<FRAMESET cols="50%, 50%">
   <FRAME src="main.html">
   <FRAME src="table_of_contents.html">
   <NOFRAMES>
   Here's the <A href="main.html">for a non-frames version.</A>
   </NOFRAMES>
</FRAMESET>
</HTML>

17.4 Inline frames: the IFRAME element

<!ELEMENT IFRAME - - (%block;)+ -- inline subwindow -->
<!ATTLIST IFRAME
  id          ID         #IMPLIED  -- document-wide unique id --
  title       CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- advisory title as for anchors --
  name        CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- name of frame for targetting --
  src         %URL;      #IMPLIED  -- source of frame content --
  frameborder (1|0)      1         -- request frame borders? --
  marginwidth %Pixels;   #IMPLIED  -- margin widths in pixels --
  marginheight %Pixels;  #IMPLIED  -- margin height in pixels --
  scrolling (yes|no|auto) auto     -- scrollbar or none --
  align       %IAlign;   #IMPLIED  -- vertical or horizontal alignment --
  height      %Length;   #IMPLIED  -- suggested height --
  width       %Length;   #IMPLIED  -- suggested width --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

Attribute definitions

width = length
     The width of the inline frame.
height = length
     The height of the inline frame.

   * name, src, frameborder, marginwidth, marginheight, scrolling (frame
     controls and decoration)
   * target (target frame information)
   * align (alignment)

The IFRAME element allows authors to insert a frame within a block of text.
Inserting an inline frame within a section of text is much like inserting an
object via the OBJECT element: they both allow you to insert an HTML
document in the middle of another, they may both be aligned with surrounding
text, etc.

The information to be inserted inline is designated by the src attribute of
this element. The contents of the IFRAME element, on the other hand, should
only be rendered by user agents that do not support frames or are configured
not to display frames.

For user agents that support frames, the following example will place an
inline frame surrounded by a border in the middle of the text.

  <IFRAME src="foo.html" width="400" height="500"
             scrolling="auto" frameborder="1">
  [Your user agent does not support frames or is currently configured
  not to display frames. However, you may visit
  <A href="foo.html">the related document.</A>]
  </IFRAME>

Inline frames may not be resized (and thus, they do not take the noresize
attribute).

Note: HTML documents may also be embedded in other HTML documents with the
OBJECT element. See the section on including files in HTML documents for
details.

  5. Form submission
       1. Processing form data
       2. Which control values are submitted

An HTML form is a section of a document containing normal content, markup,
and special elements called controls. Controls respond to and accept user
input. Users generally "complete" forms by entering text, selecting menu
items, etc., and then submitting the form for processing. Submitted forms
may either be mailed to another user or fed to a program for treatment.

Controls may be check boxes, radio buttons, labels, menus, etc. Each control
may be assigned a name. When the form is submitted, some controls (depending
on their state) have their name and current value submitted along with the
form. The nature of the value submitted depends on the control (e.g., the
value of a text box is the input text).

Note: This specification includes more detailed information about forms in
sections on form display issues. Further information on encoding form
contents is expected to be added in later revisions to this draft.

18.1 The FORM element

<!ELEMENT FORM - - (%block;)+ -(FORM) -- interactive form -->
<!ATTLIST FORM
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  action      %URL;      #REQUIRED -- server-side form handler --
  method      (GET|POST) GET       -- HTTP method used to submit the form --
  enctype     %ContentType; "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
  onsubmit    %Script;   #IMPLIED  -- the form was submitted --

  target      CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- where to render result --
  accept-charset CDATA   #IMPLIED  -- list of supported charsets --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

Attribute definitions

action = url
     This attribute specifies a program for handling the submitted form. It
     may be an HTTP URL (to submit the form to a program) or a MAILTO URL
     (to email the form).
method = get|post
     This attribute specifies which HTTP method will be used to submit
     name/value pairs to the form handler. Possible values (which are
     case-insensitive):
        o post: Use the HTTP POST method. This method includes name/value
          pairs in the body of the form and not in the URL specified by the
          action attribute.
        o get:Deprecated. Use the HTTP GET method. This method appends
          name/value pairs to the URL specified by action and sends this new
          URL to the server. This is the default value for backwards
          compatibility. This method has been deprecated for reasons of
          internationalization.
enctype = cdata
     This attribute specifies the Internet Media Type (see [MIMETYPES]) used
     to submit the form to the server (when the value of method is "post").
     The default value for this attribute is
     "application/x-www-form-urlencoded". The value "multipart/form-data"
     should be used when the returned document includes submitted files.
accept-charset = cdata
     This attribute specifies the list of character encodings for input data
     that must be accepted by the server processing this form. The value is
     a space and/or comma-delimited list of "charsets" as defined in
     [RFC2045]. The server must interpret this list as an exclusive-or list,
     i.e., the server must be able to accept any single character encoding
     per entity received.

     The default value for this attribute is the reserved string "UNKNOWN".
     User agents may interpret this value as the character encoding that was
     used to transmit the document containing this FORM element.
accept = cdata
     This attribute specifies a comma-separated list of MIME types that a
     server processing this form will handle correctly. User agents may use
     this information to filter out non-conforming files when prompting a
     user to select files to be sent to the server (cf. the INPUT element
     when type="file").

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * style (inline style information)
   * title (element titles)
   * target (target frame information)
   * onsubmit, onreset, onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup,
     onmouseover, onmousemove, onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup
     (intrinsic events)

The FORM element acts as a container for controls. It specifies:

   * The layout of the form (given by the contents of the element).
   * The program that will handle the completed and submitted form (the
     action attribute). The receiving program must be able to parse
     name/value pairs in order to make use of them.
   * The method by which user data will be sent to the server (the method
     attribute).
   * A character encoding that must accepted by the server in order to
     handle this form (the accept-charset attribute). User agents may advise
     the user of the value of the accept-charset attribute and/or to
     restrict the user's ability to enter unrecognized characters.

A form can contain text and markup (paragraphs, lists, etc.) as well as the
controls listed below.

The scope of the name attribute for any controls within a FORM element is
the FORM element.

The following example specifies that the submitted form will be processed by
the "adduser" program. The form will be sent to the program using the HTTP
POST method.

 <FORM action="http://somesite.com/prog/adduser" method="post">
 ...form contents...
 </FORM>

The following example shows how to send a submitted form to an email
address.

 <FORM action="mailto:Kligor.T@gee.whiz.com" method="post">
 ...form contents...
 </FORM>

18.2 Controls

The following control elements generally appear within a FORM element
declaration. However, these elements may also appear outside of a FORM
element declaration when they are used to build user interfaces. This is
discussed later in this specification, in the section on intrinsic events.

Control labels
Some form controls automatically have labels associated with them (press
buttons created by INPUT and BUTTON) while most do not (text fields created
by INPUT and TEXTAREA, checkboxes and radio buttons created by INPUT, and
menus created by SELECT).

For those controls that have implicit labels, user agents should take the
value of the value attribute for the label string.

For those controls without implicit labels, authors must provide labels
before or after the control element's definition. This is illustrated in the
examples below.

18.2.1 The INPUT element

<!ENTITY % InputType
  "(TEXT | PASSWORD | CHECKBOX |
    RADIO | SUBMIT | RESET |
    FILE | HIDDEN | IMAGE | BUTTON)"
   >

<!-- attribute name required for all but submit & reset -->
<!ELEMENT INPUT - O EMPTY -- form control -->

Start tag: required, End tag: forbidden

Attribute definitions

type = text|password|checkbox|radio|submit|reset|file|hidden|image|button
     This attribute specifies the type of input control to create. We
     discuss input control types below. The default value for this attribute
     is "text".
name = cdata
     This attribute assigns a name to the control. This name will be paired
     with the current value of the control if the element's value is
     submitted along with the form.
value = cdata
     This attribute specifies the initial value of the control. It is
     optional except when the control type is "radio".
size = cdata
     This attribute tells the user agent the initial width of the control.
     The width is given in pixels, except for control types "text" and
     "password" when it is the (integer) number of characters.
maxlength = integer
     When the control type is "text" or "password", this attribute specifies
     the maximum number of characters that may be entered. This number may
     exceed the specified size, in which case the user agent should offer a
     scrolling mechanism. The default value for this attribute is an
     unlimited number.
checked
     When the control type is "radio" or "checkbox", this boolean attribute
     specifies that the button is on. This attribute must be ignored for
     other control types.
src = url
     When the control type is "image", this attribute specifies the location
     of the image to be used to decorate the graphical submit button.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information)
   * alt (alternate text)
   * align (alignment)
   * accept (legal MIME types for a server)
   * readonly (read-only input controls)
   * disabled (disabled input controls)
   * tabindex (tabbing navigation)
   * accesskey (access keys)
   * usemap (client-side image maps)
   * onfocus, onblur, onselect, onchange, onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown,
     onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove, onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown,
     onkeyup (intrinsic events)

The nature of a control defined by the INPUT element depends on the value of
the type attribute.

Input types

The INPUT element's type attribute determines which control will be created.

text
     This type creates a single-line text box. The value submitted by a text
     control is the input text.
password
     Like "text", but the input text is rendered in such a way as to hide
     the characters (e.g., a series of asterisks). This control is used for
     sensitive input such as passwords. The value submitted by a password
     control is the input text (not the rendering).
checkbox
     A checkbox is an on/off switch. When the switch is on, the value of the
     checkbox is "active". When the switch is off, the value is inactive.
     The checkbox value is only submitted with the form when the switch is
     on.

     Several checkboxes within the same form may bear the same name. Upon
     submission, each "on" checkbox with the same name submits a name/value
     pair with the same name component. This allows users to select more
     than one value for a given property.

radio
     A radio button is an on/off switch. When the switch is on, the value of
     the radio button is "active". When the switch is off, the value is
     inactive. The radio button value is only submitted with the form when
     the switch is on.

     Several radio button within the same form may bear the same name.
     However, only one of these buttons may be "on" at any one time. All
     related buttons are set to "off" as soon as one is set to "on". Thus,
     for related radio buttons, only one name/value pair is ever submitted.

submit
     Creates a submit button. When this button is activated by the user, the
     form is submitted to the location specified by the action attribute of
     the parent FORM element.

     A form may contain more than one submit button. Only the name/value
     pair of the activated submit button is submitted with the form.

image
     Creates a graphical submit button. The value of the src attribute
     specifies the URL of the image that will decorate the button. Some
     users will be unable to see this image. We strongly recommend you
     provide a value for the alt attribute as an textual alternative for the
     image.

     When a pointing device is used to click on the image, the form is
     submitted and the location passed to the server. The x value is
     measured in pixels from the left of the image, and the y value in
     pixels from the top of the image. The submitted data includes
     name.x=x-value and name.y=y-value where "name" is the value of the name
     attribute, and x-value and y-value are the x and y coordinate values
     respectively.

     If the server takes different actions depending on the location
     clicked, users of non-graphical browsers will be disadvantaged. For
     this reason, you are recommended to consider alternative approaches:

        o Use multiple submit buttons (each with their own image) in place
          of a single graphical submit button. You can use style sheets to
          control the positioning of these buttons.
        o Use a client-side image map together with scripting.

     A possible future extension would be to add the usemap attribute to
     INPUT for use as as client-side image map when "type=image". The AREA
     element corresponding to the location clicked would contribute the
     value to be passed to the server. To avoid the need to modify server
     scripts, it may be appropriate to extend AREA to provide x and y values
     for use with the INPUT element.

reset
     Creates a reset button. When this button is activated by the user, all
     of the form's controls have their values reset to the initial values
     specified by their value attributes. The name/value for a reset button
     are not submitted with the form.
button
     Creates a push button that has no default behavior. The behavior of the
     button is defined by associating the button with client-side scripts
     that are triggered when events affecting the button occur (e.g.,
     clicking the button). The value of the value attribute is the label
     used for the button.

     For example, the following declaration causes the function named verify
     to be executed when the button is clicked. The script must be defined
     by a SCRIPT element.

     <INPUT type="button" value="Click Me" onclick="verify()">

     Please consult the section on intrinsic events for more information
     about scripting and events.

hidden
     Creates a element that is not rendered by the user agent. However, the
     element's name and value are submitted with the form.

     This control type is generally used to store information between
     client/server exchanges that would otherwise be loss due to the
     stateless nature of HTTP.

     INPUT controls of type hidden have their values submitted with the
     form. The same holds for controls that are not rendered because of
     style information. The following control, though hidden by the user
     agent, will have its value submitted with the form.

     <INPUT type="password" style="display:none"
               name="invisible-password"
               value="mypassword">

file
     Prompts the user for a file name. When the form is submitted, the
     contents of the file are submitted to the server as well as other user
     input.

     User agents should encapsulate multiple files in a MIME multipart
     document (see [RFC2045]). This mechanism encapsulates each file in a a
     body-part of a multipart MIME body that is sent as the HTTP entity.
     Each each body part can be labeled with an appropriate "Content-Type",
     including if necessary a "charset" parameter that specifies the
     character encoding.

The following sample HTML fragment defines a simple form that allows the
user to enter a first name, last name, email address, and sex. When the
submit button is activated, the form is sent to the program specified by the
action attribute.

 <FORM action="http://somesite.com/prog/adduser" method="post">
    <P>
    First name: <INPUT type="text" name="firstname"><BR>
    Last name: <INPUT type="text" name="lastname"><BR>
    email: <INPUT type="text" name="email"><BR>
    <INPUT type="radio" name="sex" value="Male"> Male<BR>
    <INPUT type="radio" name="sex" value="Female"> Female<BR>
    <INPUT type="submit" value="Send"> <INPUT type="reset">
 </FORM>

This form might be rendered as follows:

[An example form rendering.]

In the section on the LABEL element, we discuss marking up labels such as
"First name".

The following example shows how the contents of a user-specified file may be
submitted with a form. This example is based on an example from [RFC1867].

In this example, the user is prompted to enter a name and a list of names of
files whose contents should be submitted with the form. By specifying the
enctype value of "multipart/form-data", each file's contents are stored in a
separate section of a multipart document.

<FORM action="http://server.dom/cgi/handle"
    enctype="multipart/form-data"
    method="post">
 What is your name? <INPUT type="text" name="name_of_sender">
 What files are you sending? <INPUT type="file" name="name_of_files">
</FORM>

Please consult [RFC1867] for more information about file submissions.

The ISINDEX element

ISINDEX is deprecated. Users should use the INPUT element instead of this
element.

<!ELEMENT ISINDEX - O EMPTY -- single line prompt -->
<!ATTLIST ISINDEX
  %coreattrs;                      -- id, class, style, title --
  %i18n;                           -- lang, dir --
  prompt      CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- prompt message -->

Start tag: required, End tag: forbidden

Attribute definitions

prompt = cdata
     Deprecated. This attribute specifies a prompt string for the input
     field.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information)

The ISINDEX element causes the user agent to prompt the user for a single
line of input (allowing any number of characters). The user agent may use
the value of the prompt attribute as a title for the prompt.

DEPRECATED EXAMPLE:
The following ISINDEX declaration:

<ISINDEX prompt="Enter your search phrase: ">

is equivalent to the following INPUT declaration:

<FORM action="..." method="post">
Enter your search phrase: <INPUT type="text">
</FORM>

Semantics of ISINDEX. Currently, the semantics for ISINDEX are only
well-defined when the base URL for the enclosing document is an HTTP URL. In
practice, the input string is restricted to Latin-1 as there is no mechanism
for the URL to specify a different character set.

18.2.2 The BUTTON element

<!ELEMENT BUTTON - -
     (%inline; | %blocklevel;)+ -(A | %formctrl; | FORM | ISINDEX | FIELDSET)
     -- push button -->
<!ATTLIST BUTTON
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  name        CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- for scripting/forms as submit button --
  value       CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- gets passed to server when submitted --
  type (button|submit|reset) submit -- for use as form submit/reset button --
  disabled   (disabled)  #IMPLIED  -- control is unavailable in this context --
  tabindex    NUMBER     #IMPLIED  -- position in tabbing order --
  accesskey   CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- accessibility key character --
  onfocus     %Script;   #IMPLIED  -- the element got the focus --
  onblur      %Script;   #IMPLIED  -- the element lost the focus --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

Attribute definitions

name = cdata
     This attribute assigns a name to the button.
value = cdata
     This attribute assigns a value to the button.
type = submit|button|reset
     This attribute declares the type of the button. Possible values:
        o submit: Creates a button that submits the form that contains it.
          This is the default value.
        o button: Creates a simple push button intended to trigger a script.
        o reset: Creates a button that resets the form that contains it.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * disabled (disabled input controls)
   * accesskey (access keys)
   * usemap (client-side image maps)
   * onfocus, onblur, onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup,
     onmouseover, onmousemove, onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup
     (intrinsic events)

A BUTTON element whose type is "submit" is very similar to an INPUT element
whose type is "submit". They both cause a form to be submitted, but the
BUTTON element allows richer presentational possibilities.

A BUTTON element whose type is "submit" and whose content is an image (e.g.,
the IMG element) is very similar to an INPUT element whose type is "image".
They both cause a form to be submitted, but their presentation is different.
In this context, a graphical user agent may render an INPUT element as a
"flat" image, and render a BUTTON as a button (e.g., with relief and an
up/down motion when clicked).

The following example expands a previous example by substituting the INPUT
elements that create submit and reset buttons with BUTTON instances. The
buttons contain images by way of the IMG element.

 <FORM action="http://somesite.com/prog/adduser" method="post">
    <P>
    First name: <INPUT type="text" name="firstname"><BR>
    Last name: <INPUT type="text" name="lastname"><BR>
    email: <INPUT type="text" name="email"><BR>
    <INPUT type="radio" name="sex" value="Male"> Male<BR>
    <INPUT type="radio" name="sex" value="Female"> Female<BR>
    <BUTTON name="submit" value="submit" type="submit">
    Send<IMG src="/icons/wow.gif" alt="wow"></BUTTON>
    <BUTTON name="reset" type="reset">
    Reset<IMG src="/icons/oops.gif" alt="oops"></BUTTON>
 </FORM>

If a BUTTON is used with an IMG element, you are recommended to exploit the
IMG element's alt attribute to provide a description for users unable to see
the image.

It is illegal to associate an image map with an IMG that appears as the
contents of a BUTTON element.

ILLEGAL EXAMPLE:
The following is not considered legal HTML.

<BUTTON>
<IMG src="foo.gif" usemap="...">
</BUTTON>

A BUTTON element whose type is "reset" is very similar to an INPUT element
whose type is "reset". They both cause controls to regain their initial
values, but the BUTTON element allows richer presentation.

The BUTTON element may also be used together with scripts, in which case
it's type should be "button". When such a button is activated, a client-side
script is executed. We discuss this use of BUTTON later in the specification
in the section on intrinsic events.

18.2.3 The SELECT and OPTION elements

<!ELEMENT SELECT - - (OPTION)+ -- option selector -->
<!ATTLIST SELECT
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  name        CDATA      #IMPLIED -- field name --
  size        NUMBER     #IMPLIED  -- rows visible --
  multiple  (multiple)   #IMPLIED  -- default is single selection --
  disabled  (disabled)   #IMPLIED  -- control is unavailable in this context --
  tabindex    NUMBER     #IMPLIED  -- position in tabbing order --
  onfocus     %Script;   #IMPLIED  -- the element got the focus --
  onblur      %Script;   #IMPLIED  -- the element lost the focus --
  onchange    %Script;   #IMPLIED  -- the element value was changed --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

SELECT Attribute definitions

name = cdata
     This attribute assigns a name to the element. This name will be paired
     with any selected values when the form is submitted.
size = integer
     This attribute specifies the number of rows to be rendered by the user
     agent. The number of rows may be smaller than the number of possible
     choices. In this case, the user agent should provide a scrolling
     mechanism for accessing all possible choices.
multiple
     When set, this boolean attribute allows multiple selections. When not
     set, the SELECT element only permits single selections. Traditionally,
     visual user agents render multiple-selection elements as list boxes,
     while single-selection elements are rendered as drop-down menus.

The SELECT element creates a list of choices that may be selected by the
user. Each SELECT element must contain at least one choice. Each choice is
specified by an instance of the OPTION element.

<!ELEMENT OPTION - O (#PCDATA) -- selectable choice -->
<!ATTLIST OPTION
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  selected  (selected)   #IMPLIED
  disabled  (disabled)   #IMPLIED  -- control is unavailable in this context --
  value       CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- defaults to element content --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: optional

OPTION Attribute definitions

selected
     When set, this boolean attribute specifies that this option is selected
     (initially or by the user).
value = cdata
     This attribute specifies the value to be submitted for this choice if
     the choice is selected when the form is submitted. The value is paired
     with the name assigned to the SELECT element. If this attribute is not
     set, the submitted value defaults to the content of the OPTION element.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information)
   * disabled (disabled input controls)
   * tabindex (tabbing navigation)
   * onfocus, onblur, onchange, onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup,
     onmouseover, onmousemove, onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup
     (intrinsic events)

User agents should use the content of the OPTION element as the displayed
choice.

In this example, we create a menu that allows the user to select which of
seven software components to install. The first and second components are
initially selected but may be deselected by the user. The remaining
components are not initially selected. The size attribute states that the
menu should only have 4 rows even though the user may select from among 7
options. The other options must be made available through a scrolling
mechanism.

The SELECT is followed by submit and reset buttons.

<FORM action="http://somesite.com/prog/component-select" method="post">
   <SELECT multiple size="4" name="component-select">
      <OPTION selected value="Component_1_a">Component_1</OPTION>
      <OPTION selected value="Component_1_b">Component_2</OPTION>
      <OPTION>Component_3</OPTION>
      <OPTION>Component_4</OPTION>
      <OPTION>Component_5</OPTION>
      <OPTION>Component_6</OPTION>
      <OPTION>Component_7</OPTION>
   </SELECT>
   <INPUT type="submit" value="Send"><INPUT type="reset">
</FORM>

When the form is submitted, each selected choice will be paired with the
name "component-select" and submitted. The submitted value of each OPTION
will be its contents, except where overridden by the value attribute (here,
in the first two components).

18.2.4 The TEXTAREA element

<!ELEMENT TEXTAREA - - (#PCDATA) -- multi-line text field -->
<!ATTLIST TEXTAREA
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  name        CDATA      #IMPLIED
  rows        NUMBER     #REQUIRED
  cols        NUMBER     #REQUIRED
  disabled  (disabled)   #IMPLIED  -- control is unavailable in this context --
  readonly  (readonly)   #IMPLIED
  tabindex    NUMBER     #IMPLIED  -- position in tabbing order --
  onfocus     %Script;   #IMPLIED  -- the element got the focus --
  onblur      %Script;   #IMPLIED  -- the element lost the focus --
  onselect    %Script;   #IMPLIED  -- some text was selected --
  onchange    %Script;   #IMPLIED  -- the element value was changed --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

Attribute definitions

name = cdata
     This attribute assigns a name to the element. This name will be paired
     with the content of the element when submitted to the server.
rows = integer
     Specifies the number of visible text lines. Users should be able to
     enter more lines than this, so user agents should provide some means to
     scroll through the contents of the textarea field when the contents
     extend beyond the visible area.
cols = integer
     Specifies the visible width in average character widths. Users should
     be able to enter longer lines than this, so user agents should provide
     some means to scroll through the contents of the textarea field when
     the contents extend beyond the visible area. User agents may wrap
     visible text lines to keep long lines visible without the need for
     scrolling.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information)
   * readonly (read-only input controls)
   * disabled (disabled input controls)
   * tabindex (tabbing navigation)
   * onfocus, onblur, onselect, onchange, onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown,
     onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove, onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown,
     onkeyup (intrinsic events)

The TEXTAREA element creates a multi-line text input control (as opposed to
a single-line INPUT control). The content of this element provides the
initial text presented by the control.

This example creates a TEXTAREA control that is 20 rows by 80 columns and
contains two lines of text initially. The TEXTAREA is followed by submit and
reset buttons.

<FORM action="http://somesite.com/prog/text-read" method="post">
   <TEXTAREA name="thetext" rows="20" cols="80">
   First line of initial text.
   Second line of initial text.
   </TEXTAREA>
   <INPUT type="submit" value="Send"><INPUT type="reset">
</FORM>

Setting the readonly attribute allows authors to display unmodifiable text
in a TEXTAREA. This differs from using standard marked-up text in a document
because the value of TEXTAREA is submitted with the form.

User agents should canonicalize line endings to CR, LF (ASCII decimal 13,
10) when submitting the field's contents. The character set for submitted
data should be ISO Latin-1, unless the server has previously indicated that
it can support alternative character sets.

18.2.5 The LABEL element

<!ELEMENT LABEL - - (%inline;)* -(LABEL) -- form field label text -->
<!ATTLIST LABEL
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  for         IDREF      #IMPLIED  -- matches field ID value --
  disabled    (disabled) #IMPLIED  -- control is unavailable in this context --
  accesskey   CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- accessibility key character --
  onfocus     %Script;   #IMPLIED  -- the element got the focus --
  onblur      %Script;   #IMPLIED  -- the element lost the focus --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

Attribute definitions

for = control-name
     This attribute explicitly associates the label being defined with
     another control. The value of this attribute must be the value of the
     id attribute of some other control in the same document. In the absence
     of this attribute, the label being defined is associated with its
     contents.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information)
   * disabled (disabled input controls)
   * accesskey (access keys)
   * tabindex (tabbing navigation)
   * onclick,
   * onfocus, onblur, onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup,
     onmouseover, onmousemove, onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup
     (intrinsic events)

The LABEL element may be used to attach information to other control
elements (excluding other LABEL elements). Labels may be rendered by user
agents in a number of ways (e.g., visually, read by speech synthesizers,
etc.)

When a LABEL element receives focus, it passes the focus on to its
associated control. See the section below on access keys for examples.

To associate a label with another control explicitly, set the for attribute
of the LABEL.

This example creates a table that is used to align two INPUT controls and
their associated labels. Each label is associated explicitly with one of the
INPUT elements.

<FORM action="..." method="post">
<TABLE>
  <TR>
    <TD><LABEL for="fname">First Name</LABEL>
    <TD><INPUT type="text" name="firstname" id="fname">
  <TR>
    <TD><LABEL for="lname">Last Name</LABEL>
    <TD><INPUT type="text" name="lastname" id="lname">
</TABLE>
<FORM>

This example extends a previous example form to include LABEL elements. Note
that the LABEL elements are associated to the INPUT elements through the id
attribute.

 <FORM action="http://somesite.com/prog/adduser" method="post">
    <P>
    <LABEL for="firstname">First name: </LABEL><INPUT
              type="text" id="firstname"><BR>
    <LABEL for="lastname">Last name: </LABEL><INPUT
              type="text" id="lastname"><BR>
    <LABEL for="email"email: </LABEL><INPUT
              type="text" id="email"><BR>
    <INPUT type="radio" name="sex" value="Male"> Male<BR>
    <INPUT type="radio" name="sex" value="Female"> Female<BR>
    <INPUT type="submit" value="Send"> <INPUT type="reset">
 </FORM>

More than one LABEL may be associated with the same control by creating
multiple references via the for attribute.

To associate a label with another control implicitly, make the control the
contents of the LABEL. In this case, the LABEL may only contain one other
control element. The label itself may be positioned before or after the
associated control.

In this example, we implicitly associate two labels and two INPUT elements.
Notice that the implicit association prevents us from being able to layout
the label and its associated control in a table (see the previous example).

<FORM action="..." method="post">
<LABEL>
   First Name
   <INPUT type="text" name="firstname">
</LABEL>
<LABEL>
   <INPUT type="text" name="lastname">
   Last Name
</LABEL>
</FORM>

18.2.6 The FIELDSET and LEGEND elements

<!--
  #PCDATA is to solve the mixed content problem,
  per specification only whitespace is allowed there!
 -->
<!ELEMENT FIELDSET - - (#PCDATA,LEGEND,(%block;)+) -- form control group -->
<!ATTLIST FIELDSET
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  >

<!ELEMENT LEGEND - - (%inline;)* -- fieldset legend -->
<!ENTITY % LAlign "(top|bottom|left|right)">

<!ATTLIST LEGEND
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  align       %LAlign;   #IMPLIED  -- relative to fieldset --
  accesskey   CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- accessibility key character --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

LEGEND Attribute definitions

align = top|bottom|left|right
     This attribute specifies the position of the legend with respect to the
     fieldset. Possible values:
        o top: The legend is above the fieldset. This is the default value.
        o bottom: The legend is below the fieldset.
        o left: The legend is to the left of the fieldset.
        o right: The legend is to the right of the fieldset.

Attributes defined elsewhere

   * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
   * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
   * title (element titles)
   * style (inline style information)
   * accesskey (access keys)
   * align (alignment)
   * onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove,
     onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup (intrinsic events)

The FIELDSET element allows form designers to group thematically related
controls together. Grouping controls makes it easier for users to understand
their purpose while simultaneously facilitating tabbing navigation for
visual user agents and speech navigation for speech-oriented user agents.
The proper use of this element makes documents more accessible to people
with disabilities.

The LEGEND element allows designers to assign a caption to a FIELDSET. The
legend improves accessibility when the FIELDSET is rendered non-visually.
When rendered visually, setting the align attribute on the LEGEND element
aligns it with respect to the FIELDSET.

In this example, we create a form that one might fill out at the doctor's
office. It is divided into three sections: personal information, medical
history, and current medication. Each section contains controls for
inputting the appropriate information.

<FORM action="..." method="post">
<FIELDSET>
<LEGEND align="top">Personal Information</LEGEND>
Last Name: <INPUT name="personal_lastname" type="text" tabindex="1">
First Name: <INPUT name="personal_firstname" type="text" tabindex="2">
Address: <INPUT name="personal_address" type="text" tabindex="3">
...more personal information...
</FIELDSET>
<FIELDSET>
<LEGEND align="top">Medical History</LEGEND>
<INPUT name="history_illness"
       type="checkbox"
       value="Smallpox" tabindex="20"> Smallpox</INPUT>
<INPUT name="history_illness"
       type="checkbox"
       value="Mumps" tabindex="21"> Mumps</INPUT>
<INPUT name="history_illness"
       type="checkbox"
       value="Dizziness" tabindex="22"> Dizziness</INPUT>
<INPUT name="history_illness"
       type="checkbox"
       value="Sneezing" tabindex="23"> Sneezing</INPUT>
...more medical history...
</FIELDSET>
<FIELDSET>
<LEGEND align="top">Current Medication</LEGEND>
Are you currently taking any medication?
<INPUT name="medication_now"
       type="radio"
       value="Yes" tabindex="35">Yes</INPUT>
<INPUT name="medication_now"
       type="radio"
       value="No" tabindex="35">No</INPUT>

If you are currently taking medication, please indicate
it in the space below:
<TEXTAREA name="current_medication"
          rows="20" cols="50"
          tabindex="40">
</TEXTAREA>
</FIELDSET>
</FORM>

Note that in this example, we might improve the presentation of the form by
aligning elements within each FIELDSET (with style sheets), adding color and
font information (with style sheets), adding scripting (say, to only open
the "current medication" text area if the user indicates he or she is
currently on medication), etc.

18.3 Giving focus to an element

Active elements in HTML documents must receive focus from the user in order
to perform their tasks. For example, users must activate a link specified by
the A element in order to follow the specified link. Similarly, users must
give a TEXTAREA focus in order to enter text into it.

There are several ways to give focus to an element:

   * Designate the element with a pointing device.
   * Navigate from one element to the next with the keyboard. The document's
     author may define a tabbing order that specifies the order in which
     elements will receive focus if the user navigates the document with the
     keyboard (tabbing navigation). Once selected, an element may be
     activated by some other key sequence.
   * Select an element by a series of keyboard actions known as an access
     key (sometimes called "keyboard shortcut" or "keyboard accelerator").

18.3.1 Tabbing navigation

Attribute definitions

tabindex = integer
     This attribute specifies the position of the current element in the
     tabbing order for the current document. This value may be a positive or
     negative integer.

The tabbing order defines the order in which elements will receive focus
when navigated by the user via the keyboard. The tabbing order may include
elements nested within other elements.

Elements that may receive focus should be navigated by user agents according
to the following rules:

  1. Those elements that support the tabindex attribute and assign a costive
     value to it are navigated first. Navigation proceeds from the element
     with the lowest tabindex value to the element with the highest value.
     Values need not be sequential nor must they begin with any particular
     value. Elements that have identical tabindex should be navigated in the
     order they appear in the document.
  2. Those elements that do not define the tabindex attribute or do not
     support it are navigated next. These elements are navigated in the
     order they appear in the document.
  3. Those elements that support the tabindex attribute and assign a
     negative value to it do not participate in the tabbing order.
  4. Elements that are disabled do not participate in the tabbing order.

The following elements support the tabindex attribute: A, AREA, OBJECT,
INPUT, SELECT, TEXTAREA, and BUTTON.

In this example, the tabbing order will be the BUTTON, the INPUT elements in
order (note that "field1" and the button share the same tabindex, but
"field1" appears later in the document), and finally the link created by the
A element.

<HTML>
<BODY>
...some text...
Go to the
<A tabindex="10" href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C Web site.</A>
...some more...
<BUTTON type="button" name="get-database"
           tabindex="1" onclick="get-database">
Get the current database.
</BUTTON>
...some more...
<FORM action="..." method="post">
<INPUT tabindex="1" type="text" name="field1">
<INPUT tabindex="2" type="text" name="field2">
<INPUT tabindex="3" type="submit" name="submit">
</FORM>
</BODY>
</HTML>

Tabbing keys. The actual key sequence that causes tabbing navigation or
element activation depends on the configuration of the user agent (e.g., the
"tab" key is used for navigation and the "enter" key is used to activate a
selected element).

User agents may also define key sequences to navigate the tabbing order in
reverse. When the end (or beginning) of the tabbing order is reached, user
agents may circle back to the beginning (or end).

18.3.2 Access keys

Attribute definitions

accesskey = cdata
     This attribute assigns an access key to an element. An access key is a
     single character from the document character set.Note. Authors should
     consider the input method of the expected reader when specifying an
     accesskey.

Pressing an access key assigned to an element gives focus to the element.
The action that is executed when an element receives focus depends on the
element. Links defined by A are generally followed by the user agent,
activated radio buttons change values, text fields with focus allow user
input, etc.

The following elements support the accesskey attribute: LABEL, A, CAPTION,
and LEGEND.

This example assigns the access key "U" to a label associated with an INPUT
control. Typing the access key gives focus to the label which in turn gives
it to the associated control. The user may then enter text into the INPUT
area.

<FORM action="..." method="post">
<LABEL for="fuser" accesskey="U">
User Name
</LABEL>
<INPUT type="text" name="user" id="fuser">
</FORM>

In this example, we assign an access key to a link defined by the A element.
Typing this access key takes the user to another document, in this case, a
table of contents.

<A accesskey="C"
      href="http://someplace.com/specification/contents.html">
    Table of Contents</A>

The invocation of access keys depends on the underlying system. For
instance, on machines running MS Windows, one generally has to press the
"alt" key in addition to the access key. On Apple systems, one generally has
to press the "cmd" key in addition to the access key.

The rendering of access keys depends on the user agent. We recommend that
authors include the access key in label text or wherever the access key is
to apply. User agents should render the value of an access key in such a way
as to emphasize its role and to distinguish it from other characters (e.g.,
by underlining it).

18.4 Disabled and read-only elements

In contexts where user input is either undesirable or irrelevant, it is
important to be able to disable an element or render it read-only. For
example, one may want to disable a form's submit button until the user has
entered some required data. Similarly, an author may want to include a piece
of read-only text that must be submitted as a value along with the form. The
following sections describe disabled and read-only elements.

18.4.1 Disabled elements

Attribute definitions

disabled
     When set for a form control, this boolean attribute disables the
     control for user input.

When set, the disabled attribute has the following effects on an element:

   * Disabled elements do not receive focus.
   * Disabled elements are skipped in tabbing navigation.
   * Values of disabled controls are not submitted with a form.

The following elements support the disabled attribute: INPUT, TEXTAREA,
SELECT, OPTION, OBJECT, LABEL, and BUTTON.

How disabled elements are rendered depends on the user agent. For example,
some user agents "gray out" disabled menu items, button labels, etc.

In this example, the disabled INPUT element cannot receive user input nor
will its value be submitted with the form.

<INPUT disabled name="fred" value="stone">

Note: The only way to modify dynamically the value of the disabled attribute
is through a script.

18.4.2 Read-only elements

Attribute definitions

readonly
     When set for a form control, this boolean attribute prohibits changes
     to control.

The readonly attribute specifies whether the element may be modified by the
user.

When set, the readonly attribute has the following effects on an element:

   * Read-only elements receive focus but cannot be modified by the user.
   * Read-only elements are included in tabbing navigation.
   * Values of read-only controls are submitted with a form.

The following elements support the readonly attribute: INPUT, TEXT,
PASSWORD, and TEXTAREA.

How read-only elements are rendered depends on the user agent.

Note: The only way to modify dynamically the value of the readonly attribute
is through a script.

18.5 Form submission

18.5.1 Processing form data

A form may contain named form controls that may have initial values. The
user may interact with some of the controls, possibly changing their values
(e.g., entering text, toggling radio buttons, etc.). When the user submits
the form (e.g., by activating a submit button), the user agent processes it
as follows.

Step one: Build a form data set

First, the user agent builds a form data set, based on the values of the
form controls at submission time. For form data set is a sequence of
name/value pairs.

The names are values of the name attribute specified by each form control.

The type of each form control determines how its name is paired with values.
For instance, when three INPUT elements whose type is "checkbox" share the
same name, each checkbox value is paired with one instance of the name in
the form data set. On the other hand, when three INPUT elements whose type
is "radio" share the same name, the value of the active button is paired
with the name one time only. Please consult the definition of each form
control for information about which value or values are paired with the
control's name.

Not all form controls have their values submitted with the form. See the
section on which control values are submitted for details.

Each value is a character string. Please consult the definition of each form
control for information about constraints on values imposed by the control.

Step two: Encode the form data set

The names and values of the form data set are then encoded according to the
method specified by the enctype attribute of the FORM element. The default
encoding is "application/x-www-form-urlencoded", which is defined as
follows:

  1. Form field names and values are escaped. Space characters are replaced
     by `+', and then reserved characters are escaped as described in
     [RFC1738]: Non-alphanumeric characters are replaced by `%HH', a percent
     sign and two hexadecimal digits representing the ASCII code of the
     character. Line breaks, as in multi-line text field values, are
     represented as "CR LF" pairs, i.e., `%0D%0A'.
  2. The fields are listed in the order they appear in the document with the
     name separated from the value by `=' and the pairs separated from each
     other by `&'. Fields with null values may be omitted. In particular,
     unselected radio buttons and checkboxes should not appear in the
     encoded data, but hidden fields with value attributes present should.

Step three: Submit the encoded form data set

Finally, the encoded data is sent to the handler addressed by the action
attribute using the protocol specified by the method attribute.

This specification does not specify all valid data set encodings and
submission methods. However, HTML 4.0 user agents must support the
established conventions in the following cases:

   * If the method is "get":
        o If action is an HTTP URL, the user agent takes the value of
          action, appends a `?' to it, then appends the form data set,
          encoded using the default encoding. The user agent then traverses
          the link to this URL.In this scenario, form data are restricted to
          ASCII codes.
        o For any other type of action, behavior is unspecified.
   * Else if the method is "post":
        o If action is an HTTP URL:
             + If the value of enctype is "multipart/form-data", see
               [RFC1867], section 7.
             + Else, if the value of enctype is the default value or
               "application/x-www-urlencoded", the user agent conducts an
               HTTP POST transaction using the value of action and a message
               body of type "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".
             + Else, for other values of enctype, behavior is unspecified.
        o For any other value of action, behavior is unspecified.
   * For any other value of method, behavior is unspecified.

The user agent should display the response from either the HTTP GET or POST
transactions.

18.5.2 Which control values are submitted

Not all elements have their values submitted with a form.

For INPUT elements with type="radio" or type="checkbox", and SELECT
elements, only the selected values should be submitted.

Conforming user agents should not submit:

   * Disabled form controls.
   * Form controls without values for the name attribute.
   * OBJECT elements without the name attribute.
   * OBJECT elements with the declare attribute.

  2. Designing documents for user agents that don't support scripting
       1. The NOSCRIPT element
       2. Commenting out scripts

A client-side script is a program that may accompany an HTML document or be
embedded directly in it. The program executes on the client's machine when
the document loads, or at some other time such as when a link is activated.
HTML's support for scripts is independent of the scripting language.

Scripts offer authors a means to extend HTML document in highly active and
interactive ways. For example:

   * Scripts may be evaluated as a document loads to modify the contents of
     the document dynamically.
   * Scripts may accompany a form to process input as it is entered.
     Designers may dynamically fill out parts of a form based on the values
     of other fields. They may also ensure that input data conforms to
     predetermined ranges of values, that fields are mutually consistent,
     etc.
   * Scripts may be triggered by events that affect the document, such as
     loading, unloading, element focus, mouse movement, etc.
   * Scripts may be linked to form controls (e.g., buttons) to produce
     graphical user interface elements.

There are two types of scripts authors may attach to an HTML document:

   * Those that are executed one time when the document is loaded by the
     user agent. Scripts that appear within a SCRIPT element are executed
     when the document is loaded. For user agents that cannot or will not
     handle scripts, authors may include alternate content via the NOSCRIPT
     element.
   * Those that are executed every time a specific event occurs. These
     scripts may be assigned to a number of elements via the intrinsic event
     attributes.

Note: This specification includes more detailed information about scripting
in sections on script macros.

19.1 Designing documents for user agents that support scripting

The following sections discuss issues that concern user agents that support
scripting.

19.1.1 The SCRIPT element

<!ELEMENT SCRIPT - - CDATA      -- script statements -->
<!ATTLIST SCRIPT
  type        CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- Internet content type for
                                      script language --
  language    CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- predefined script language name --
  src         %URL;      #IMPLIED  -- URL for an external script --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

Attribute definitions

type = cdata
     This attribute specifies the scripting language of the contents of this
     element. The value must be an Internet Media Type. There is no default
     value for this attribute.
language = cdata
     Deprecated.This attribute specifies the scripting language of the
     contents of this element. Its value is an identifier for the language,
     but since these identifiers are not standard, this attribute has been
     deprecated in favor of type.
src = url
     This attribute specifies the location of an external script.

The SCRIPT element places a script within a document. This element may
appear any number of times in the HEAD or BODY of an HTML document.

The script may be defined within the contents of the SCRIPT element or in an
external file. If the src attribute is not set, user agents must interpret
the contents of the element as the script. If the src has a URL value, user
agents must ignore the element's contents and retrieve the script via the
URL.

Scripts are evaluated by script engines that must be known to a user agent.

19.1.2 Specifying the scripting language

As HTML does not rely on a specific scripting language, document authors
must explicitly tell user agents the language of each script. This may be
done either through a default declaration or a local declaration.

Documents that contain neither a default scripting language declaration nor
a local one for a SCRIPT element are incorrect. User agents may still try to
interpret the script but are not required to.

The default scripting language

To specify the default scripting language for all scripts in a document
include the following META declaration in the HEAD of a document:

<META http-equiv="Content-Script-Type" content="type">

where "type" is an Internet Media Type (see [MIMETYPES]) naming the
scripting language. Examples of values include "text/tcl",
"text/javascript", "text/vbscript". See [MIMETYPES] for a complete list of
valid scripting language types.

In the absence of a META declaration, the default can be set by a
"Content-Script-Type" HTTP header.

    Content-Script-Type: type

where "type" is again an Internet Media Type naming the scripting language.

When several HTTP headers and META elements occur, the last one defines the
default scripting language. For our purposes, HTTP headers are considered to
occur earlier than the document HEAD.

Local declaration of a scripting language

It is also possible to specify the scripting language in each SCRIPT element
via the type attribute. In the absence of a default scripting language
specification, this attribute must be set on each SCRIPT element. When a
default scripting language has been specified, the type attribute overrides
it.

In this example, we declare the default scripting language to be "text/tcl".
We include one SCRIPT in the header, whose script is located in an external
file and is in the scripting language "text/vbscript". We also include one
SCRIPT in the body, which contains its own script written in
"text/javascript".

<HTML>
<HEAD>
<META http-equiv="Content-Script-Type" content="text/tcl">
<SCRIPT type="text/vbscript" src="http://someplace.com/progs/vbcalc">
</SCRIPT>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<SCRIPT type="text/javascript">
...some JavaScript...
</SCRIPT>
</BODY>
</HTML>

References to HTML elements from a script

Each scripting language has its own conventions for referring to HTML
objects from within a script. This specification does not define a standard
mechanism for referring to HTML objects.

However, scripts should refer to an element according to its assigned name.
Scripting engines should observe the following precedence rules when
identifying an element: a name attribute takes precedence over a id if both
are set. Otherwise, one or the other may be used.

19.1.3 Syntax of script content

The content of the SCRIPT element is a script, and as such, must not be
evaluated by the user agent as HTML markup. The user agent must pass it on
as data to a script engine.

HTML parsers must be able to recognize script data as beginning immediately
after the start tag and ending as soon as the ETAGO ("</") delimiters are
followed by a name character ([a-zA-Z]). The script data does not
necessarily end with the </SCRIPT> end tag, but is terminated by any "</"
followed by a name character.

Consequently, any HTML markup that is meant to be sent to a script engine
(which may do whatever it wants with the markup) must be "escaped" so as not
to confuse the HTML parser. Designers of each scripting language should
recommend language-specific support for resolving this issue.

ILLEGAL EXAMPLE:
The following code is invalid due the to presence of the "</EM>" characters
found inside of the SCRIPT element:

    <SCRIPT type="text/javascript">
      document.write ("<EM>This won't work</EM>")
    </SCRIPT>

A conforming parser must treat the "</EM>" data as the end of script data,
which is clearly not what the author intended.

In JavaScript, this code can be expressed legally by ensuring that the
apparent ETAGO delimiter does not appear immediately before an SGML name
start character:

    <SCRIPT type="text/javascript">
      document.write ("<EM>This will work<\/EM>")
    </SCRIPT>

In Tcl, one may accomplish this as follows:

    <SCRIPT type="text/tcl">
      document write "<EM>This will work<\/EM>"
    </SCRIPT>

In VBScript, the problem may be avoided with the Chr() function:


    "<EM>This will work<\" & Chr(47) + "EM>"

19.1.4 Intrinsic events

Note. Authors of HTML documents are advised that changes are likely to occur
in realm of intrinsic events (e.g., how scripts are bound to events).
Research in this realm is carried on by members of the W3C Document Object
Model working group (see the W3C Web Site at http://www.w3.org/ for more
information).

Attribute definitions

onload = script
     The onload event occurs when the user agent finishes loading a window
     or all frames within a FRAMESET. This attribute may be used with BODY
     and FRAMESET elements.
onunload = script
     The onunload event occurs when the user agent removes a document from a
     window or frame. This attribute may be used with BODY and FRAMESET
     elements.
onclick = script
     The onclick event occurs when the pointing device button is clicked
     over an element. This attribute may be used with most elements.
ondblclick = script
     The ondblclick event occurs when the pointing device button is double
     clicked over an element. This attribute may be used with most elements.
onmousedown = script
     The onmousedown event occurs when the pointing device button is pressed
     over an element. This attribute may be used with most elements.
onmouseup = script
     The onmouseup event occurs when the pointing device button is released
     over an element. This attribute may be used with most elements.
onmouseover = script
     The onmouseover event occurs when the pointing device is moved onto an
     element. This attribute may be used with most elements.
onmousemove = script
     The onmousemove event occurs when the pointing device is moved while it
     is over an element. This attribute may be used with most elements.
onmouseout = script
     The onmouseout event occurs when the pointing device is moved away from
     an element. This attribute may be used with most elements.
onfocus = script
     The onfocus event occurs when an element receives focus either by the
     pointing device or by tabbing navigation. This attribute may be used
     with the following elements: LABEL, INPUT, SELECT, TEXTAREA, and
     BUTTON.
onblur = script
     The onblur event occurs when an element loses focus either by the
     pointing device or by tabbing navigation. It may be used with the same
     elements as onfocus.
onkeypress = script
     The onkeypress event occurs when a key is pressed and released over an
     element. This attribute may be used with most elements.
onkeydown = script
     The onkeydown event occurs when a key is pressed down over an element.
     This attribute may be used with most elements.
onkeyup = script
     The onkeyup event occurs when a key is released over an element. This
     attribute may be used with most elements.
onsubmit = script
     The onsubmit event occurs when a form is submitted. It only applies to
     the FORM element.
onreset = script
     The onreset event occurs when a form is reset. It only applies to the
     FORM element.
onselect = script
     The onselect event occurs when a user selects some text in a text
     field. This attribute may be used with the INPUT and TEXTAREA elements.
onchange = script
     The onchange event occurs when a control loses the input focus and its
     value has been modified since gaining focus. This attribute applies to
     the following elements: INPUT, SELECT, and TEXTAREA.

It is possible to associate an action with a certain number of events that
occur when a user interacts with a user agent. Each of the "intrinsic
events" listed above takes a value that is a script. The script is executed
whenever the event occurs for that element.

Control elements such as INPUT, SELECT, BUTTON, TEXTAREA, and LABEL all
respond to certain intrinsic events. When these elements do not appear
within a form, they may be used to augment the graphical user interface of
the document.

For instance, designers may want to include press buttons in their documents
that do not submit a form but still communicate with a server when they are
activated.

The following examples show some possible control and user interface
behavior based on intrinsic events.

In the following example, userName is a required text field. When a user
attempts to leave the field, the onblur event calls a JavaScript function to
confirm that userName has an acceptable value.

<INPUT NAME="userName" onblur="validUserName(this.value)">

Here is another JavaScript example:

<INPUT NAME="num"
    onchange="if (!checkNum(this.value, 1, 10))
        {this.focus();this.select();} else {thanks()}"
    VALUE="0">

Here is a VBScript example of an event handler for a text field:

    <INPUT name="edit1" size="50">
    <SCRIPT type="text/vbscript">
      Sub edit1_changed()
        If edit1.value = "abc" Then
          button1.enabled = True
        Else
          button1.enabled = False
        End If
      End Sub
    </SCRIPT>

Here is the same example using Tcl:

    <INPUT name="edit1" size="50">
    <SCRIPT type="text/tcl">
      proc edit1_changed {} {
        if {[edit value] == abc} {
          button1 enable 1
        } else {
          button1 enable 0
        }
      }
      edit1 onChange edit1_changed
    </SCRIPT>

Here is a JavaScript example for event binding within a script. First,
here's a simple click handler:


<BUTTON type="button" name="mybutton" value="10">
<SCRIPT type="text/javascript">
      function my_onclick() {
         . . .
      }
    document.form.mybutton.onclick = my_onclick
 </SCRIPT>
 </BUTTON>

Here's a more interesting window handler:


<SCRIPT type="text/javascript">
      function my_onload() {
         . . .
      }

      var win = window.open("some/other/URL")
      if (win) win.onload = my_onload
</SCRIPT>

In Tcl this looks like:

 <SCRIPT type="text/tcl">
     proc my_onload {} {
       . . .
     }
     set win [window open "some/other/URL"]
     if {$win != ""} {
         $win onload my_onload
     }
 </SCRIPT>

Note that "document.write" or equivalent statements in intrinsic event
handlers create and write to a new document rather than modifying the
current one.

Parsing of intrinsic event scripts

The script attributes for intrinsic events are defined as CDATA. The SGML
processing of CDATA attribute values requires that (1) entity replacement
occur within the attribute value; and (2) that the attribute value be
delimited by matching pairs of double quotes (") or single quotes (').

Given these lexical restrictions, the delimiters ('), ("), "&", and "&#" may
not occur freely in the value of a script attribute. To resolve this issue,
we recommend that script event handler attributes always use (") delimiters
and that occurrences of (") and "&" inside an event handler attribute be
written as follows:

    '"'  should be written as "&quot;" or as "&#34;"
    '&'  should be written as "&amp;"  or as "&#38;"

Thus, for example, one could write:

 <INPUT name="num" value="0"
 onchange="if (compare(this.value, &quot;help&quot;)) {gethelp()}">

SGML permits (') to be included in attribute strings quoted by ("), and vice
versa. The following is therefore correct:

"this is 'fine'" and 'so is "this"'

19.1.5 Dynamic modification of documents

Scripts that are executed when a document is loaded may be able to modify
the document's contents dynamically. The ability to do so depends on the
scripting language itself (e.g., the "document.write" statement in the HTML
object model supported by some vendors).

The dynamic modification of a document may be modeled as follows:

  1. All SCRIPT elements are evaluated in order as the document is loaded.
  2. All script constructs within a given SCRIPT element that generate SGML
     CDATA are evaluated. Their combined generated text is inserted in the
     document in place of the SCRIPT element.
  3. The generated CDATA is re-evaluated.

HTML documents are constrained to conform to the HTML DTD both before and
after processing any SCRIPT elements.

The following example illustrates how scripts may modify a document
dynamically. The following script:

 <TITLE>Test Document</TITLE>
 <SCRIPT type="text/javascript">
     document.write("<p><b>Hello World!<\/b>")
 </SCRIPT>

Has the same effect as this HTML markup:

 <TITLE>Test Document</TITLE>
 <P><B>Hello World!</B>

19.2 Designing documents for user agents that don't support scripting

The following sections discuss issues about lack of support for scripting
that authors should also consider when designing good HTML documents.

19.2.1 The NOSCRIPT element

<!ELEMENT NOSCRIPT - - (%block;)+
  -- alternate content container for non script-based rendering -->
<!ATTLIST NOSCRIPT
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  >

Start tag: required, End tag: required

The NOSCRIPT element allows authors to provide alternate content when a
script is not executed. The content of a NOSCRIPT element should only
rendered by a script-aware user agent in the following cases:

   * The user agent is configured not to evaluate scripts.
   * The user agent doesn't support a scripting language invoked by a SCRIPT
     element earlier in the document.

User agents that do not support client-side scripts must render this
element's contents.

In the following example, a user agent that executes the SCRIPT will include
some dynamically created data in the document. If the user agent doesn't
support scripts, the user may still retrieve the data through a link.

<SCRIPT type="text/tcl">
 ...some Tcl script to insert data...
</SCRIPT>
<NOSCRIPT>
 <P>Access the <A href="http://someplace.com/data">data.</A>
</NOSCRIPT>

19.2.2 Commenting out scripts

User agents that don't recognize the SCRIPT element will likely render that
element's contents as text. Some scripting engines, including those for
languages JavaScript, VBScript, and Tcl allow the script statements to be
enclosed in an SGML comment. User agents that don't recognize the SCRIPT
element will thus ignore the comment while smart scripting engines will
understand that the script in comments should be executed.

Another solution to the problem is to keep scripts in external documents and
refer to them with the src attribute.

Commenting scripts in JavaScript
The JavaScript engine allows the string "<!--" to occur at the start of a
SCRIPT element, and ignores further characters until the end of the line.
JavaScript interprets "//" as starting a comment extending to the end of the
current line. This is needed to hide the string "-->" from the JavaScript
parser.

<SCRIPT type="text/javascript">
<!--  to hide script contents from old browsers
  function square(i) {
    document.write("The call passed ", i ," to the function.","<BR>")
    return i * i
  }
  document.write("The function returned ",square(5),".")
// end hiding contents from old browsers  -->
</SCRIPT>

Commenting scripts in VBScript
In VBScript, a single quote character causes the rest of the current line to
be treated as a comment. It can therefore be used to hide the string "-->"
from VBScript, for instance:

   <SCRIPT type="text/vbscript">
     <!--
       Sub foo()
        ...
       End Sub
     ' -->
    </SCRIPT>

Commenting scripts in TCL
In Tcl, the "#" character comments out the rest of the line:

<SCRIPT type="text/tcl">
<!--  to hide script contents from old browsers
  proc square {i} {
    document write "The call passed $i to the function.<BR>"
    return [expr $i * $i]
  }
  document write "The function returned [square 5]."
# end hiding contents from old browsers  -->
</SCRIPT>

Note: Some browsers close comments on the first ">" character, so to hide
script content from such browsers, you can transpose operands for relational
and shift operators (e.g., use "y < x" rather than "x > y") or use scripting
language-dependent escapes for ">".

                   20 SGML reference information for HTML

Contents

  1. Document Validation
  2. Sample SGML catalog

The following sections contain the formal SGML definition of HTML 4.0,
including the SGML declaration and the Document Type Definition (DTD), as
well as a sample SGML catalog.

20.1 Document Validation

Many authors rely on a limited set of browsers to check on the documents
they produce, assuming that if the browsers can render their documents they
are valid. Unfortunately, this is a very ineffective means of verifying a
document's validity precisely because browsers are designed to cope with
invalid documents by rendering them as well as they can to avoid frustrating
users.

The following sample SGML catalog can be used with an SGML parser, such as
nsgmls (see [SP]), to verify that HTML documents conform to the HTML 4.0
DTD. It assumes that the DTD has been saved as the file "HTML4.dtd" and that
the entities are in the files "HTMLlat1.ent", "HTMLsymbol.ent" and
"HTMLspecial.ent". Make sure your SGML parser is capable of handling
Unicode. See your validation tool documentation for further details.

Beware that such validation, although useful and highly recommended, does
not guarantee that a document fully conforms to the HTML 4.0 specification.
This is because an SGML parser relies solely on the given SGML DTD which
does not express all aspects of a valid HTML 4.0 document. Specifically, an
SGML parser ensures that the syntax, the structure, the list of elements and
their attributes are valid. But for instance, it cannot catch errors such as
setting the width attribute of an IMG element to an invalid value (i.e.,
"foo", "12.5", or "25%"). Although the specification restricts the value for
this attribute to an "integer representing a length in pixels", the DTD only
defines it to be CDATA, which actually allows any value. Only a specialized
program could capture the complete specification of HTML 4.0.

Nevertheless, this type of validation is still highly recommended since it
permits the detection of a large set of errors that make documents invalid.

20.2 Sample SGML catalog

This catalog includes the override directive to ensure that processing
software such as nsgmls uses public identifiers in preference to system
identifiers. This means that users do not have to be connected to the Web
when retrieving URL-based system identifiers.

Contents

  1. The Document Character Set
       1. Data transfer
  2. The SGML Declaration

21.1 The Document Character Set

The HTML 4.0 document character set, in the SGML sense, is the Universal
Character Set (UCS) of [ISO10646]. This is code-by-code identical with the
[UNICODE] standard.

21.1.1 Data transfer

HTML documents can be transmitted in a variety of encodings as described in
the section "HTML Document Character Set" near the beginning of this
specification. Characters outside the range of the encoding need to be
represented as entity references. This is unnecessary with a more direct
encoding of Unicode such as UTF-8 or UTF-16. After compression the resultant
file sizes are close to that for character encodings such as ISO-8859-1 and
EUC-JP.

When HTML text is transmitted directly in UTF-16 (charset="UTF-16"), text
data should be transmitted in big-endian byte order (high order byte first)
in accordance with ISO 10646 Section 6.3 and Unicode 2.0, clause C3, page
3-1 (see [UNICODE]).

Furthermore, to maximize chances of proper interpretation, it is recommended
that documents transmitted as UTF-16 always begin with a ZERO-WIDTH
NON-BREAKING SPACE character (hexadecimal FEFF) which, when byte-reversed
becomes number FFFE, a character guaranteed to be never assigned. Thus, a
user-agent receiving an FFFE as the first octets of a text would know that
bytes have to be reversed for the remainder of the text.

The UTF-1 transformation format of [ISO10646] (registered by IANA as
ISO-10646-UTF-1), should not be used.

Note that ISO Registration Number 177 strictly speaking refers to the
original state of ISO 10646 in 1993, while in this specification, we always
refer to the most up-to-date form of ISO 10646. Changes since 1993 have been
the addition of characters and a one-time operation reallocating a large
number of codepoints for Korean Hangul (Amendment 5).

    This is an EXPERIMENTAL version of the HTML 4.0 DTD which
    excludes presentation attributes and elements that W3C expects
    to phase out as support for style sheets matures. If you need
    these features please use the transitional DTD. HTML 4.0
    includes mechanisms for style sheets, scripting, embedding
    objects, improved support for right to left and mixed direction
    text, and enhancements to forms for improved accessibility for
    people with disabilities.

 The BORDER attribute sets the thickness of the frame around the
 table. The default units are screen pixels.

 The FRAME attribute specifies which parts of the frame around
 the table should be rendered. The values are not the same as
 CALS to avoid a name clash with the VALIGN attribute.

 The value "border" is included for backwards compatibility with
 <TABLE BORDER> which yields frame=border and border=implied
 For <TABLE BORDER=1> you get border=1 and frame=implied. In this
 case, it is appropriate to treat this as frame=border for backwards
 compatibility with deployed browsers.

                  23 Transitional Document Type Definition

<!--
    This is an EXPERIMENTAL version of the HTML 4.0 "transitional"
    DTD which includes presentation attributes and elements that
    W3C expects to phase out as support for style sheets matures.
    HTML 4.0 includes mechanisms for style sheets, scripting,
    embedding objects, improved support for right to left and mixed
    direction text, and enhancements to forms for improved
    accessibility for people with disabilities.

          Draft: $Date$

          Authors:
              Dave Raggett <dsr@w3.org>
              Arnaud Le Hors <lehors@w3.org>

    This is work in progress, subject to change at any time.
    It does not imply endorsement by, or the consensus of,
    either W3C or members of the HTML working group. Further
    information about HTML 4.0 is available at:

          http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html40/.
-->
<!ENTITY % HTML.Version "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"
  -- Typical usage:

    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
    <html>
    <head>
    ...
    </head>
    <body>
    ...
    </body>
    </html>

    The FPI for the strict HTML 4.0 DTD is:

        "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN"

    You are recommended to use the strict DTD unless you need the
    presentation control for user agents that don't (adequately)
    support style sheets.

   If you are writing a frameset document you should use the
   following FPI:

        "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Frameset//EN"

    You can also use a URL as a system identifier for the DTD, as in:

    <!DOCTYPE HTML SYSTEM "http://www.w3.org/DTD/HTML4-strict.dtd">

    or better still together with the public identifier as in:

    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN"
            "http://www.w3.org/DTD/HTML4-strict.dtd">

    The user agent can then download the DTD and entity sets as needed.
    The following URLs are supported in relation to HTML 4.0

    "http://www.w3.org/DTD/HTML4-strict.dtd" (strict DTD)
    "http://www.w3.org/DTD/HTML4-loose.dtd" (loose DTD)
    "http://www.w3.org/DTD/HTML4-frameset.dtd" (frameset documents)

 The BORDER attribute sets the thickness of the frame around the
 table. The default units are screen pixels.

 The FRAME attribute specifies which parts of the frame around
 the table should be rendered. The values are not the same as
 CALS to avoid a name clash with the VALIGN attribute.

 The value "border" is included for backwards compatibility with
 <TABLE BORDER> which yields frame=border and border=implied
 For <TABLE BORDER=1> you get border=1 and frame=implied. In this
 case, it is appropriate to treat this as frame=border for backwards
 compatibility with deployed browsers.

       1. The list of characters
  3. Named entities for markup-significant and internationalization
     characters
       1. The list of characters

A character entity is an SGML construct that references a character of the
document character set. The document character set for HTML is the Universal
Character Set (UCS) of [ISO10646]. This set is character-by-character
equivalent to Unicode 2.0 ([UNICODE]).

This version of HTML supports several sets of named character entities:

   * ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) characters In accordance with section 14 of
     [RFC1866], the set of Latin-1 entities has been extended by this
     specification to cover the whole right part of ISO-8859-1 (all code
     positions with the high-order bit set), including the already commonly
     used &nbsp;, &copy; and &reg;. The names of the entities are taken from
     the appendices of SGML ([ISO8879]).
   * symbols, mathematical symbols, and Greek letters. These characters may
     be represented by glyphs in the Adobe font "Symbol".
   * markup-significant and internationalization characters (e.g., for
     bidirectional text).

The following sections present the complete lists of named character
entities. Although by convention, [ISO10646] names are written with upper
case letters, we have converted them to lower case in this specification for
reasons of readability.

25.1 Named entities for ISO 8859-1 characters

The named character entities in this section produce characters whose
numeric equivalents should already be supported by conforming HTML 2.0 user
agents. Thus, the named character entity &divide; is a more convenient form
than &#247; for obtaining the division sign (÷).

To support these named entities, user agents need only recognize the entity
names and convert them to characters that lie within the repertoire of
[ISO88591].

Character 65533 (FFFD hexadecimal) is the last valid character in UCS-2.
65534 (FFFE hexadecimal) is unassigned and reserved as the byte-swapped
version of ZERO WIDTH NON-BREAKING SPACE for byte-order detection purposes.
65535 (FFFF hexadecimal) is unassigned.

25.2 Named entities for symbols, mathematical symbols, and Greek letters

The named character entities in this section produce characters that may be
represented by glyphs in the widely available Adobe Symbol font, including
Greek characters, various bracketing symbols, and a selection of
mathematical operators such as gradient, product, and summation symbols.

To support these entities, user agents may support full [ISO10646] or use
other means. Display of glyphs for these characters may be obtained by being
able to display the relevant [ISO10646] characters or by other means, such
as internally mapping the listed entities, numeric character references, and
characters to the appropriate position in some font that contains the
requisite glyphs.

When to use Greek entities. This entity set contains all the letters used in
modern Greek. However, it does not include Greek punctuation, precomposed
accented characters nor the non-spacing accents (tonos, dialytika) required
to compose them. There are no archaic letters, Coptic-unique letters, or
precomposed letters for Polytonic Greek. The entities defined here are not
intended for the representation of modern Greek text and would not be an
efficient representation; rather, they are intended for occasional Greek
letters used in technical and mathematical works.

25.3 Named entities for markup-significant and internationalization
characters

The named character entities in this section are for escaping
markup-significant characters (these are the same as those in HTML 2.0 and
3.2), for denoting spaces and dashes. Other characters in this section apply
to internationalization issues such as the disambiguation of bidirectional
text (see the section on bidirectional text for details).

Entities have also been added for the remaining characters occuring in
CP-1252 which do not occur in the HTMLlat1 or HTMLsymbol entity sets. These
all occur in the 128 to 159 range within the cp-1252 charset. These entities
permit the characters to be denoted in a platform-independent manner.

To support these entities, user agents may support full [ISO10646] or use
other means. Display of glyphs for these characters may be obtained by being
able to display the relevant [ISO10646] characters or by other means, such
as internally mapping the listed entities, numeric character references, and
characters to the appropriate position in some font that contains the
requisite glyphs.

              Appendix A. Changes between HTML 3.2 and HTML 4.0

Contents

  1. Changes to elements
       1. New elements
       2. Deprecated elements
       3. Obsolete elements
  2. Changes to Tables
  3. Changes to Forms

A.1 Changes to elements

A.1.1 New elements

The new elements in this version of HTML are Q, INS, DEL, ACRONYM, LEGEND,
COLGROUP, BUTTON, and FIELDSET.

A.1.2 Deprecated elements

The following elements are now deprecated: ISINDEX, APPLET, CENTER, FONT,
BASEFONT, STRIKE, S, U, DIR, and MENU.

A.1.3 Obsolete elements

The following elements are now obsolete: XMP, PLAINTEXT, and LISTING. For
all of them, you should use the PRE element instead.

A.2 Changes to Tables

The HTML 4.0 table model has grown out of early work on HTML+ and the
initial draft of HTML3.0. The earlier model has been extended in response to
requests from information providers for improved control over the
presentation of tabular information:

   * The ability to align on designated characters such as "." and":"
     (e.g., aligning a column of numbers on the decimal point).
   * The need for more flexibility in specifying table frames and rules.
   * The need for incremental display of large tables as data is received.
   * The ability to support scrollable tables with fixed headers plus better
     support for breaking tables across pages for printing.
   * The need for optional column based defaults for alignment properties

In addition, a major goal has been to provide backwards compatibility with
the widely deployed Netscape implementation of tables. Another goal has been
to simplify importing tables conforming to the SGML CALS model. The latest
draft makes the align attribute compatible with the latest versions of the
most popular browsers. Some clarifications have been made to the role of the
dir attribute attribute and recommended behavior when absolute and relative
column widths are mixed.

A new element, COLGROUP, has been introduced to allow sets of columns to be
grouped with different width and alignment properties specified by one or
more COL elements. The semantics of COLGROUP have been clarified over
previous drafts, and rules="basic" replaced by rules="groups".

The style attribute is included as a means for extending the properties
associated with edges and interiors of groups of cells. For instance, the
line style: dotted, double, thin/thick etc; the color/pattern fill for the
interior; cell margins and font information. This will be the subject for a
companion specification on style sheets.

The frame and rules attributes have been modified to avoid SGML name clashes
with each other, and to avoid clashes with the align and valign attributes.
These changes were additionally motivated by the desire to avoid future
problems if this specification is extended to allow frame and rules
attributes with other table elements.

A.3 Changes to Forms

The forms specified in HTML 3.2 have the following problems:

   * There is no provision for keyboard shortcuts for particular actions,
     for access keys for driving menus, etc.
   * Although form controls can be made insensitive dynamically, they cannot
     be declared as such at initialization time.
   * Along the same line form controls, such as form fields, cannot be made
     "read only".
   * Labels for radio buttons and checkboxes are not sensitive, i.e.,
     clicking on a label text doesn't effect the button state.
   * There is no way to markup groups of related form fields in a way that
     effectively supports browsing with speech-based user agents.
   * There is no provision for checking values as they are entered into form
     fields. All checking is done at the server when the form's contents are
     submitted.
   * Nothing is provided to specify what type of data file is expected when
     the user is asked to submit files.
   * Forms can only contain the two buttons submit and reset.
   * There is no way to specify what character sets the server issuing a
     form can handle.

To solve these problems this specification introduces several new attributes
and elements.

   * The accesskey attribute provides for specifying direct keyboard access
     to form fields.
   * The disabled attribute allows form providers to make a form control
     initially insensitive.
   * And with the additional attribute readonly, authors can prohibit
     changes to a form field.
   * The LABEL element associates a label with a particular form control.
     The FIELDSET element groups related fields together and, in association
     with the LEGEND element, can be used to name the group. Both of these
     new elements allow better rendering and better interactivity.
     Speech-based browsers can better describe the form and graphic browsers
     can make labels sensitive.
   * A new set of attributes, including onchange-INPUT, in association with
     support for scripting languages, allows form providers to verify
     user-entered data.
   * The INPUT element has a new attribute accept that allows authors to
     specify a list of valid media types or type patterns for the input.
   * The new BUTTON element can be used to make richer forms with more than
     just a submit and a reset button.
   * The FORM element includes the attribute accept-charset, modeled on the
     HTTP "Accept-Charset" header (see [RFC2068]). This attribute (first
     proposed in [RFC1867]) may be used to specify a list of character sets
     acceptable to the server.

B.1 Notes on helping search engines index your Web site

This section provides some simple suggestions that will make your documents
more accessible to search engines.

Define the document language
     In the global context of the Web it is important to know which human
     language a page was written in. This is discussed in the section on
     language information.
Specify language variants of this document
     If you have prepared translations of this document into other
     languages, you should use the LINK element to reference these. This
     allows an indexing engine to offer users search results in the user's
     preferred language, regardless of how the query was written. For
     instance, the following links offer French and German alternatives to a
     search engine:

     <LINK rel="alternate" href="mydoc-fr.html"
              lang="fr" title="La vie souterrainne">
     <LINK rel="alternate" href="mydoc-de.html"
              lang="de" title="Das Leben im Untergrund">

Provide keywords and descriptions
     Some indexing engines look for META elements that define a
     comma-separated list of keywords/phrases, or that give a short
     description. Search engines may present these keywords as the result of
     a search. The value of the name attribute sought by a search attribute
     is not defined by this specification. Consider these examples,

      <META name="keywords" content="vacation,Greece,sunshine">
      <META name="description" content="Idylic European vacations">

Indicate the beginning of a collection
     Collections of word processing documents or presentations are
     frequently translated into collections of HTML documents. It is helpful
     for search results to reference the beginning of the collection in
     addition to the page hit by the search. You may help search engines by
     using the LINK element with rel="begin" along with a TITLE, as in:


     <LINK rel="begin"
              href="page1.html"
              title="General Theory of Relativity">

Provide robots with indexing instructions
     People may be surprised to find that their site has been indexed by an
     indexing robot and that the robot should not have been permitted to
     visit a sensitive part of the site. Many Web robots offer facilities
     for Web site administrators and content providers to limit what the
     robot does. This is achieved through two mechanisms: a "robots.txt"
     file and the META element in HTML documents, described below.

B.1.1 Search robots

The robots.txt file

When a Robot visits a Web site, say http://www.foobar.com/, it firsts checks
for http://www.foobar.com/robots.txt. If it can find this document, it will
analyze its contents to see if it is allowed to retrieve the document. You
can customize the robots.txt file to apply only to specific robots, and to
disallow access to specific directories or files.

Here is a sample robots.txt file that prevents all robots from visiting the
entire site

        User-agent: *    # applies to all robots
        Disallow: /      # disallow indexing of all pages

The Robot will simply look for a "/robots.txt" URL on your site, where a
site is defined as a HTTP server running on a particular host and port
number. Here are some sample locations for robots.txt:

                Site URL                  URL for robots.txt

        http://www.w3.org/        http://www.w3.org/robots.txt

        http://www.w3.org:80/     http://www.w3.org:80/robots.txt

        http://www.w3.org:1234/   http://www.w3.org:1234/robots.txt

        http://w3.org/            http://w3.org/robots.txt

There can only be a single "/robots.txt" on a site. Specifically, you should
not put "robots.txt" files in user directories, because a robot will never
look at them. If you want your users to be able to create their own
"robots.txt", you will need to merge them all into a single "/robots.txt".
If you don't want to do this your users might want to use the Robots META
Tag instead.

Some tips: URL's are case-sensitive, and "/robots.txt" string must be all
lower-case. Blank lines are not permitted.

There must be exactly one "User-agent" field. The robot should be liberal in
interpreting this field. A case insensitive substring match of the name
without version information is recommended.

If the value is "*", the record describes the default access policy for any
robot that has not matched any of the other records. It is not allowed to
have multiple such records in the "/robots.txt" file.

The "Disallow" field specifies a partial URL that is not to be visited. This
can be a full path, or a partial path; any URL that starts with this value
will not be retrieved. For example,

    Disallow: /help disallows both /help.html and /help/index.html, whereas
    Disallow: /help/ would disallow /help/index.html but allow /help.html.

An empty value for "Disallow", indicates that all URLs can be retrieved. At
least one "Disallow" field must be present in the robots.txt file.

Robots and the META element

The META element allows HTML authors to tell visiting robots whether a
document may be indexed, or used to harvest more links. No server
administrator action is required.

In the following example a robot should neither index this document, nor
analyze it for links.

<META name="ROBOTS" content="NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW">

The list of terms in the content is ALL, INDEX, NOFOLLOW, NOINDEX. The name
and the content attribute values are case-insensitive.

Note: In early 1997 only a few robots implement this, but this is expected
to change as more public attention is given to controlling indexing robots.

B.2 Notes on tables

B.2.1 Design rationale

The HTML table model has evolved from studies of existing SGML tables
models, the treatment of tables in common word processing packages, and a
wide range of tabular layout techniques in magazines, books and other
paper-based documents. The model was chosen to allow simple tables to be
expressed simply with extra complexity available when needed. This makes it
practical to create the markup for HTML tables with everyday text editors
and reduces the learning curve for getting started. This feature has been
very important to the success of HTML to date.

Increasingly, people are creating tables by converting from other document
formats or by creating them directly with WYSIWYG editors. It is important
that the HTML table model fit well with these authoring tools. This affects
how the cells that span multiple rows or columns are represented, and how
alignment and other presentation properties are associated with groups of
cells.

Dynamic reformatting

A major consideration for the HTML table model is that the author does not
control how a user will size a table, what fonts he or she will use, etc.
This makes it risky to rely on column widths specified in terms of absolute
pixel units. Instead, tables must be able to change sizes dynamically to
match the current window size and fonts. Authors can provide guidance as to
the relative widths of columns, but user agents should ensure that columns
are wide enough to render the width of the largest element of the cell's
content. If the author's specification must be overridden, relative widths
of individual columns should not be changed drastically.

Incremental display

For large tables or slow network connections, incremental table display is
important to user satisfaction. User agents should be able to begin
displaying a table before all of the data has been received. The default
window width for most user agents shows about 80 characters, and the
graphics for many HTML pages are designed with these defaults in mind. By
specifying the number of columns, and including provision for control of
table width and the widths of different columns, authors can give hints to
user agents that allow the incremental display of table contents.

For incremental display, the browser needs the number of columns and their
widths. The default width of the table is the current window size
(width="100%"). This can be altered by setting the width-TABLE attribute of
the TABLE element. By default, all columns have the same width, but you can
specify column widths with one or more COL elements before the table data
starts.

The remaining issue is the number of columns. Some people have suggested
waiting until the first row of the table has been received, but this could
take a long time if the cells have a lot of content. On the whole it makes
more sense, when incremental display is desired, to get authors to
explicitly specify the number of columns in the TABLE element.

Authors still need a way of telling user agents whether to use incremental
display or to size the table automatically to fit the cell contents. In the
two pass auto-sizing mode, the number of columns is determined by the first
pass. In the incremental mode, the number of columns must be stated up
front. It makes more sense to set the cols attribute to the number of
columns rather than using some "layout" attribute (e.g., layout="fixed" or
layout="auto").

Structure and presentation

HTML distinguishes structural markup such as paragraphs and quotations from
rendering idioms such as margins, fonts, colors, etc. How does this
distinction affect tables? From the purist's point of view, the alignment of
text within table cells and the borders between cells is a rendering issue,
not one of structure. In practice, though, it is useful to group these with
the structural information, as these features are highly portable from one
application to the next. The HTML table model leaves most rendering
information to associated style sheets. The model presented in this
specification is designed to take advantage of such style sheets but not to
require them.

Current desktop publishing packages provide very rich control over the
rendering of tables, and it would be impractical to reproduce this in HTML,
without making HTML into a bulky rich text format like RTF or MIF. This
specification does, however, offer authors the ability to choose from a set
of commonly used classes of border styles. The frame attribute controls the
appearance of the border frame around the table while the rules attribute
determines the choice of rulings within the table. A finer level of control
will be supported via rendering annotations. The style attribute can be used
for specifying rendering information for individual elements. Further
rendering information can be given with the STYLE element in the document
head or via linked style sheets.

During the development of this specification, a number of avenues were
investigated for specifying the ruling patterns for tables. One issue
concerns the kinds of statements that can be made. Including support for
edge subtraction as well as edge addition leads to relatively complex
algorithms. For instance, work on allowing the full set of table elements to
include the frame and rules attributes led to an algorithm involving some 24
steps to determine whether a particular edge of a cell should be ruled or
not. Even this additional complexity doesn't provide enough rendering
control to meet the full range of needs for tables. The current
specification deliberately sticks to a simple intuitive model, sufficient
for most purposes. Further experimental work is needed before a more complex
approach is standardized.

Row and column groups

This specification provides a superset of the simpler model presented in
earlier work on HTML+. Tables are considered as being formed from an
optional caption together with a sequence of rows, which in turn consist of
a sequence of table cells. The model further differentiates header and data
cells, and allows cells to span multiple rows and columns.

Following the CALS table model (see [CALS]), this specification allows table
rows to be grouped into head and body and foot sections. This simplifies the
representation of rendering information and can be used to repeat table head
and foot rows when breaking tables across page boundaries, or to provide
fixed headers above a scrollable body panel. In the markup, the foot section
is placed before the body sections. This is an optimization shared with CALS
for dealing with very long tables. It allows the foot to be rendered without
having to wait for the entire table to be processed.

Accessibility

For the visually impaired, HTML offers the hope of setting to rights the
damage caused by the adoption of windows based graphical user interfaces.
The HTML table model includes attributes for labeling each cell, to support
high quality text to speech conversion. The same attributes can also be used
to support automated import and export of table data to databases or
spreadsheets.

B.2.2 Recommended Layout Algorithms

If the cols attribute on the TABLE element specifies the number of columns,
then the table may be rendered using a fixed layout, otherwise the
autolayout algorithm described below should be used.

If the width attribute is not specified, visual user agents should assume a
default value of 100% for formatting.

It is recommended that user agents increase table widths beyond the value
specified by width in cases when cell contents would otherwise overflow.
User agents that override the specified width should do so within reason.
User agents may elect to split words across lines to avoid the need for
excessive horizontal scrolling or when such scrolling is impractical or
undesired.

For the purposes of layout, user agents should consider that table captions
(specified by the CAPTION element) behave like cells. Each caption is a cell
that spans all of the table's columns if at the top or bottom of the table,
and rows if at the left or right side of the table.

Fixed Layout Algorithm

For this algorithm, it is assumed that the number of columns is known. The
column widths by default should be set to the same size. Authors may
override this by specifying relative or absolute column widths, using the
COLGROUP or COL elements. The default table width is the space between the
current left and right margins, but may be overridden by the width attribute
on the TABLE element, or determined from absolute column widths. To deal
with mixtures of absolute and relative column widths, the first step is to
allocate space from the table width to columns with absolute widths. After
this, the space remaining is divided up between the columns with relative
widths.

The table syntax alone is insufficient to guarantee the consistency of
attribute values. For instance, the number of columns specified by the cols
attribute may be inconsistent with the number of columns implied by the COL
elements. This in turn, may be inconsistent with the number of columns
implied by the table cells. A further problem occurs when the columns are
too narrow to avoid overflow of cell contents. The width of the table as
specified by the TABLE element or COL elements may result in overflow of
cell contents. It is recommended that user agents attempt to recover
gracefully from these situations, e.g., by hyphenating words and resorting
to splitting words if hyphenation points are unknown.

In the event that an indivisible element causes cell overflow, the user
agent may consider adjusting column widths and re-rendering the table. In
the worst case, clipping may be considered if column width adjustments
and/or scrollable cell content are not feasible. In any case, if cell
content is split or clipped this should be indicated to the user in an
appropriate manner.

Autolayout Algorithm

If the COLS attribute is missing from the table start tag, then the user
agent should use the following autolayout algorithm. It uses two passes
through the table data and scales linearly with the size of the table.

In the first pass, line wrapping is disabled, and the user agent keeps track
of the minimum and maximum width of each cell. The maximum width is given by
the widest line. Since line wrap has been disabled, paragraphs are treated
as long lines unless broken by BR elements. The minimum width is given by
the widest text element (word, image, etc.) taking into account leading
indents and list bullets, etc. In other words, it is necessary to determine
the minimum width a cell would require in a window of its own before the
cell begins to overflow. Allowing user agents to split words will minimize
the need for horizontal scrolling or in the worst case, clipping the cell
contents.

This process also applies to any nested tables occurring in cell content.
The minimum and maximum widths for cells in nested tables are used to
determine the minimum and maximum widths for these tables and hence for the
parent table cell itself. The algorithm is linear with aggregate cell
content, and broadly speaking, independent of the depth of nesting.

To cope with character alignment of cell contents, the algorithm keeps three
running min/max totals for each column: Left of align char, right of align
char and unaligned. The minimum width for a column is then: max(min_left +
min_right, min_non-aligned).

The minimum and maximum cell widths are then used to determine the
corresponding minimum and maximum widths for the columns. These in turn, are
used to find the minimum and maximum width for the table. Note that cells
can contain nested tables, but this doesn't complicate the code
significantly. The next step is to assign column widths according to the
available space (i.e., the space between the current left and right
margins).

For cells that span multiple columns, a simple approach (as used by Arena)
consists of apportioning the min/max widths evenly to each of the
constituent columns. A slightly more complex approach is to use the min/max
widths of unspanned cells to weight how spanned widths are apportioned.
Experiments suggest that a blend of the two approaches gives good results
for a wide range of tables.

The table borders and intercell margins need to be included in assigning
column widths. There are three cases:

  1. The minimum table width is equal to or wider than the available space.
     In this case, assign the minimum widths and allow the user to scroll
     horizontally. For conversion to braille, it will be necessary to
     replace the cells by references to notes containing their full content.
     By convention these appear before the table.
  2. The maximum table width fits within the available space. In this case,
     set the columns to their maximum widths.
  3. The maximum width of the table is greater than the available space, but
     the minimum table width is smaller. In this case, find the difference
     between the available space and the minimum table width, lets call it
     W. Lets also call D the difference between maximum and minimum width of
     the table.

     For each column, let d be the difference between maximum and minimum
     width of that column. Now set the column's width to the minimum width
     plus d times W over D. This makes columns with large differences
     between minimum and maximum widths wider than columns with smaller
     differences.

This assignment step is then repeated for nested tables using the minimum
and maximum widths derived for all such tables in the first pass. In this
case, the width of the parent table cell plays the role of the current
window size in the above description. This process is repeated recursively
for all nested tables. The topmost table is then rendered using the assigned
widths. Nested tables are subsequently rendered as part of the parent
table's cell contents.

If the table width is specified with the width attribute, the user agent
attempts to set column widths to match. The width attribute is not binding
if this results in columns having less than their minimum (i.e.,
indivisible) widths.

If relative widths are specified with the COL element, the algorithm is
modified to increase column widths over the minimum width to meet the
relative width constraints. The COL elements should be taken as hints only,
so columns shouldn't be set to less than their minimum width. Similarly,
columns shouldn't be made so wide that the table stretches well beyond the
extent of the window. If a COL element specifies a relative width of zero,
the column should always be set to its minimum width.

When using the two pass layout algorithm, the default alignment position in
the absence of an explicit or inherited charoff attribute can be determined
by choosing the position that would center lines for which the widths before
and after the alignment character are at the maximum values for any of the
lines in the column for which align="char". For incremental table layout the
suggested default is charoff="50%". If several cells in different rows for
the same column use character alignment, then by default, all such cells
should line up, regardless of which character is used for alignment. Rules
for handling objects too large for column apply when the explicit or implied
alignment results in a situation where the data exceeds the assigned width
of the column.

Choice of attribute names. It would have been preferable to choose values
for the frame attribute consistent with the rules attribute and the values
used for alignment. For instance: none, top, bottom, topbot, left, right,
leftright, all. Unfortunately, SGML requires enumerated attribute values to
be unique for each element, independent of the attribute name. This causes
immediate problems for "none", "left", "right" and "all". The values for
theframe attribute have been chosen to avoid clashes with the rules, align
and valign-COLGROUP attributes. This provides a measure of future proofing,
as it is anticipated that the frame and rules attributes will be added to
other table elements in future revisions to this specification. An
alternative would be to make frame a CDATA attribute. The consensus of the
W3C HTML Working Group was that the benefits of being able to use SGML
validation tools to check attributes based on enumerated values outweighs
the need for consistent names.

B.3 Notes on forms

B.3.1 Incremental display

The incremental display of documents being received from the network gives
rise to certain problems with respect to forms. User agents should prevent
forms from being submitted until all of the form's elements have been
received.

The incremental display of documents raises some issues with respect to
tabbing navigation. The heuristic of giving focus to the lowest valued
tabindex in the document seems reasonable enough at first glance. However
this implies having to wait until all of the document's text is received,
since until then, the lowest valued tabindex may still change. If the user
hits the tab key before then, it is reasonable for user agents to move the
focus to the lowest currently available tabindex.

If forms are associated with client-side scripts, there is further potential
for problems. For instance, a script handler for a given field may refer to
a field that doesn't yet exist.

B.3.2 Future projects

This specification defines a set of elements and attributes powerful enough
to fulfill the general need for producing forms. However there is still room
for many possible improvements. For instance the following problems could be
addressed in the future:

   * The range of form field types is too limited in comparison with modern
     user interfaces. For instance there is no provision for tabular data
     entry, sliders or multiple page layouts.
   * Servers cannot update the fields in a submitted form and instead have
     to send a complete HTML document causing screen flicker.
   * These also cause problems for speech based browsers, making it
     difficult for the visually impaired to interact with HTML forms.

B.4 Notes on scripting

B.4.1 Reserved syntax for future script macros

This specification reserves syntax for the future support of script macros
in HTML CDATA attributes. The intention is to allow attributes to be set
depending on the properties of objects that appear earlier on the page. The
syntax is:

   attribute = "... &{ macro body }; ... "

Current Practice for Script Macros

The macro body is made up of one or more statements in the default scripting
language (as per intrinsic event attributes). The semicolon following the
right brace is always needed, as otherwise the right brace character "}" is
treated as being part of the macro body. Its also worth noting that quote
marks are always needed for attributes containing script macros.

The processing of CDATA attributes proceeds as follows:

  1. The SGML parser evaluates any SGML entities (e.g., "&gt;").
  2. Next the script macros are evaluated by the script engine.
  3. Finally the resultant character string is passed to the application for
     subsequent processing.

Macro processing takes place when the document is loaded (or reloaded) but
does not reoccur when the document is resized, repainted, etc.

Here are some examples using JavaScript. The first one randomizes the
document background color:


<BODY bgcolor='&{randomrbg()};'>

Perhaps you want to dim the background for evening viewing:


<BACKGROUND src='&{if(Date.getHours > 18)...};'>

The next example uses JavaScript to set the coordinates for a client-side
image map:


<MAP NAME=foo>
   <AREA shape="rect" coords="&{myrect(imageurl)};" href="&{myurl};">
 </MAP>

This example sets the size of an image based upon document properties:


<IMG src="bar.gif" width='&{document.banner.width/2};' height='50%'>

You can set the URL for a link or image by script:

 <SCRIPT>
   function manufacturer(widget) {
       ...
   }
   function location(manufacturer) {
       ...
   }
   function logo(manufacturer) {
       ...
   }
 </SCRIPT>
  <A href='&{location(manufacturer("widget"))};'>widget</A>
  <IMG src='&{logo(manufacturer("widget"))};'>

This last example shows how SGML CDATA attributes can be quoted using single
or double quote marks. If you use single quotes around the attribute string
then you can include double quote marks as part of the attribute string.
Another approach is use &quot; for double quote marks:


<IMG src="&{logo(manufacturer(&quot;widget&quot;))};">

B.5 Notes on accessibility

B.5.1 Generating alternate text

When an author does not set the alt attribute for the IMG or APPLET
elements, user agents should supply the alternate text, calculated in the
following order:

  1. If the title has been specified, its value should be used as alternate
     text.
  2. Otherwise, if HTTP headers provide title information when the included
     object is retrieved, this information should be used as alternate text.
  3. Otherwise, if the included object contains text fields (e.g., GIF
     images contain some text fields), information extracted from the text
     fields should be used as alternate text. Since user agents may have to
     retrieve an entire object first in order to extract textual
     information, user agents may adopt more economical approaches (e.g.,
     content negotiation).
  4. Otherwise, in the absence of other information, user agents should use
     the file name (minus the extension) as alternate text.

When an author does not set the alt attribute for the INPUT element, user
agents should supply the alternate text, calculated in the following order:

  1. If the title has been specified, its value should be used as alternate
     text.
  2. Otherwise, if the name has been specified, its value should be used as
     alternate text.
  3. Otherwise (submit and reset buttons), the value of the type attribute
     should be used as alternate text.
