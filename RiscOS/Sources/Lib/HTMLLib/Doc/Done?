Missing out a TR appears fatal to HTMLLib (it generates garbage
structures) even when it is implied, e.g.

<TABLE>
  <TD></TD>
  <!-- and maybe several of... -->
  <TR><TD></TD></TR> <!-- etc. -->
</TABLE>

FRAME tags are not passed to the browser if they have no content, i.e.
you just have <FRAME>. This is crucial to some page layouts though,
so such tags need to be sent with sensible defaults (e.g. the
URL to fetch in the 'src' field of the HStream would be NULL or point
to a null string).
