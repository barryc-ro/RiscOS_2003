Entities split across fetched chunks often fail to work, and reverse entity
scanning is required so &quotThis (for example) can be handled (priority
on this has been raised recently as Dataflex have been complaining...).

Missing out a TR appears fatal to HTMLLib (it generates garbage
structures) even when it is implied, e.g.

<TABLE>
  <TD></TD>
  <!-- and maybe several of... -->
  <TR><TD></TD></TR> <!-- etc. -->
</TABLE>

FRAME tags are not passed to the browser if they have no content, i.e.
you just have <FRAME>. This is crucial to some page layouts though,
so such tags need to be sent with sensible defaults (e.g. the
URL to fetch in the 'src' field of the HStream would be NULL or point
to a null string).

There are various spacing rules for when white space should and should
not be ignored in HTML, dependent upon whether the spaces come before
or after starting or ending tags. However, I believe there should be a
special case for comments where white space is ignored. The effects of
not doing so can be seen for example at

The left hand 'List by...' frame has an 'Aspects' section, where the
'Set name' item is indented by a preceeding space. The HTML source
for this section is:

  <TR>
    <TD ALIGN="CENTER" BGCOLOR="#996633">
      <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva"><B>Aspects</B></FONT>
    </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD ALIGN="LEFT"> <!-- BGCOLOR="#003366" -->
      <FONT SIZE="-1">
      <A TARGET="series" HREF="data/setname.html">Set&nbsp;Name</A><BR>
      <A TARGET="series" HREF="data/setnumber.html">Set&nbsp;Number</A><BR>
      <A TARGET="series" HREF="data/setsize.html">Number&nbsp;of&nbsp;Pieces</A><BR>
      </FONT>
    </TD>
  </TR>

The space between the '<TD ALIGN="LEFT">' and '<!--' comment start is,
I think, the one that's getting through to the browser. I strongly
suggest chatting to Kevin about this one as he wrote the new code that
handles spacing rules more intelligently and should be able to point
you to the section that needs altering.
