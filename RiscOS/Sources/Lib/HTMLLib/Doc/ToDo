Inheritance of table attributes down to cell level - that is, the simplest
table definition follows a heirarchy:

<TABLE>
  <TR>
    <TD></TD>
    <TD></TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>

Most table attributes can be put in TABLE, TR, or TD. TABLE influences all
cells, TR influences those in the row, and TD influences just that cell.
The browser should not have to worry about this - each TD should stand
alone with a correct set of attributes in the table_headdata structure.
This is not fully implemented at present.

Certain table attributes are not implemented yet. RFC 1942's stuff is, I
believe, but other commonly used extensions aren't. For example, the
ability to specify a border which just covers horizontal cell edges.

<CAPTION> is not supported?

<A NAME="a_name">...</A> around a table means that table gets underlined
as a link. Browser or HTMLLib problem...?

<META> - need to come to some implementation of this soon, to support
in particular client pull. This is commonly used to redirect a browser
from one page to another and failing to support it typically results
in lots of grey screens with a 'Ready' message and nothing else
obvious happening...!

JavaScript support specific to DataFlex, as discussed before. More
details available on request (basically, OnClick and OnLoad support in
<A> and <BODY> tags respectively).
