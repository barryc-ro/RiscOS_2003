Remove <SCRIPT> stuff

<BODY> and <HEAD> elements issue - autodetection of when you're in HEAD
and when you're in BODY is no longer working at all. This is frequently
catastrophic to a web page. We need to in the short term get this working,
and in the not-much-longer term review this entire philosophy. I'm
starting to think that the entire HEAD / BODY distinction is not needed,
and perhaps we should just have any tag that can appear in HEAD or BODY
using separate identification bits in the HStream structure so the actual
parsing context becomes irrelevant.

Inheritance of table attributes down to cell level - that is, the simplest
table definition follows a heirarchy:

<TABLE>
  <TR>
    <TD></TD>
    <TD></TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>

Most table attributes can be put in TABLE, TR, or TD. TABLE influences all
cells, TR influences those in the row, and TD influences just that cell.
The browser should not have to worry about this - each TD should stand
alone with a correct set of attributes in the table_headdata structure.
This is not fully implemented at present.

The table system uses sensible defaults for various table attributes, but
these only work if the TABLE tag has at least one attribute already.
E.g. <TABLE WIDTH=50> will also set up, say, BORDER=1. So these defaults
should always happen, even if there are no attributes on TABLE; we also
need to review what those defaults are (e.g. should be BORDER=0, not
BORDER=1).

Vertical white space - needs sorting; find out what tokens can be
coagulated, which are not necessary, and get rid of the type 0x100 tags
which should never be generated at all.

Horizontal spacing:

This seems a valid thing to do as comments 'don't exist' as far as the
parser is supposed to be concerned, so they should certainly not interfere
with the spacing rules code.

Certain table attributes are not implemented yet. RFC 1942's stuff is, I
believe, but other commonly used extensions aren't. For example, the
ability to specify a border which just covers horizontal cell edges.

<CAPTION> is not supported?

<A NAME="a_name">...</A> around a table means that table gets underlined
as a link. Browser or HTMLLib problem...?

<META> - need to come to some implementation of this soon, to support
in particular client pull. This is commonly used to redirect a browser
from one page to another and failing to support it typically results
in lots of grey screens with a 'Ready' message and nothing else
obvious happening...!

JavaScript support specific to DataFlex, as discussed before. More
details available on request (basically, OnClick and OnLoad support in
<A> and <BODY> tags respectively).
