<H2><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction to HTML</A></H2>
HTML is an evolving language which
is used to construct documents which
can be viewed by World Wide Web browsers.
HTML has been standardized by the
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Consortium/">WWW consortium</A>
as the IETF
<A HREF="ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1866.txt">RFC 1866</A>,
commonly referred to as HTML Version 2.
However, the RFC is forming the base for further work in
extending and enhancing the standard, and various user agent
vendors are already shipping products with extensions beyond
this RFC.
RFC 1866 also declares some earlier HTML elements obsolete.
There is active work on-going to standardize specifications
of many enhancements to RFC 1866 on a wide variety of topics.
These topics include (in no special order):
<dl><dt>tables<dd>This is very close to consensus, with only
a few areas of contention.  It includes significant changes/enhancements
from existing implementations of tables, yet does not go as far
in providing table layout and presentation control as
some wanted.  Future enhancements to the area of tables are expected.
<dt>internationalization<dd>This involves HTML elements and attributes
to ease the use of non-english languages in web pages.  Note that
this is trying to address not only the problem of right-to-left languages
but also non-english alphabets/scripts.
This is commonly referred to as the <code>i18n</code> proposal.
<dt>file upload<dd>This is designed to allow a FORM to send a local
file as part of a FORM submission, so long as the user actively
concurs in the action.  This has already reached consensus as
<A HREF="ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1867.txt">RFC 1867</A>,
but needs to be merged with RFC 1866.
<dt>APPLET and EMBED<dd>Much work is on-going to merge these two
mechanisms to invoke/include some non-HTML at a spot on an HTML page.
The desire is to allow/standardize things like JAVA(tm) but to develop a much
more generalized HTML markup mechanism.  I expect the markup of this
whole area to dramatically change in the near future.
<dt>link types<dd>This is to deal with the whole area of REL/REV.
Work in this area seems to be slow to come to a proposal, but
a low level of discussion continues in this area.

<dt>client-side image maps<dd>This is to define areas of an IMG which,
if selected/clicked, will invoke identified hyperlinks.  This capability
already exists by placing an IMG with an ISMAP attribute within the
contents of an A element which points to a program which will accept
the coordinates selected and take action.  This proposal is to define
the elements/attributes that will allow all this to be specified in
the actual HTML document without need for a responding program.
A proposal exists in this area, which is included in this reference
manual, but
little further work is apparent in this area at this time even though
many browsers are implementing enhancements which provide this.
<dt>style sheets<dd>A full conference on this topic was recently held
in France.  While some of the implementation details are still in hot
debate, the basic concept of providing some linkage from an HTML page
to style sheets to specify presentation is completely accepted.
I predict that most vendors will let the standards group get closer to
final agreement before they begin to offer this capability.
<dt>math<dd>There have been preliminary proposals in this area, and
discussion sporadically continues, but I have not observed any significant
progress towards a formal proposal or consensus on HTML markup for
math formulae.  At present users are including these as images.
</dl>
Some of these enhancements were packaged earlier as a single proposal
known as Version 3.  However, the proposals have been split into
separate topics for ease of discussion in the standards group
and the package known as Version 3 has currently been withdrawn.
HTML+ was a preliminary draft of the proposals known as Version 3.
There is now some talk of interim Versions 2.x to
standardize the various separate topics as they reach consensus.
It is unclear when, or if, there will be a sufficient collection
of enhancements to be (again) called Version 3.
<p>
This Reference Manual reflects the official RFC as well as
two kinds of major enhancements/extensions known to the author:
those implemented on user agents currently actively used at
Sandia Labs, and those major proposals in the standards group
which are, in the opinion of the author, nearing stability and consensus.
While this may introduce confusion by describing non-existent features,
or features available only in one vendor's product,
there is value in being aware of the proposed directions in this language.
For further information about HTML and the continuing standards
process, see <a href="#Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a>.
<p>
Not all current browsers (user agents) implement all features of RFC 1866.
In addition, some browsers define and handle their own extensions.
A browser is supposed to ignore any element or attribute
of the HTML language that it is not designed to handle.

<hr>
<H2><A NAME="Conformance">Conformance</A></H2>
RFC 1866 defines two subsets of HTML: recommended and deprecated.
The recommended subset consist of only those features of the language
that are unlikely to compromise the structural integrity of a document.
The deprecated subset includes certain features of the language necessary
for backward compatibility, but are tended to be used and implemented
inconsistently, and their use is discouraged.
As of the IETF HTML BOF of 26 July 1994,
five levels of conformance of the HTML Language elements were defined.
RFC 1866 explicitly refers to level 1 and level 2, and implies level 0.
RFC 1866 does not currently include anything from level 3 or 4.
User agents (browsers) can choose (and declare) what level of
conformance they fulfill.
<dl compact>
<dt>Level 0
<dd>Mandatory.  Heading, lists, anchors, etc.
<br> (A text only browser is expected to have Level 0 conformance.)
<dt>Level 1
<dd>Images, Emphasis, Text highlighting
<dt>Level 2
<dd>Forms, Character Definitions
<dt>Level 3
<dd>Tables, Figures, etc.
<br> (proposed as extensions to RFC 1866)
<dt>Level 4
<dd>Mathematical formulae
<br> (proposed as an extension to RFC 1866, not existing practice,
not yet included in this Reference Manual)

<H2><A NAME="Sandia">Sandia Requirements</A></H2>
The Integrated Information Services Division of Sandia National Laboratories
has established a set of requirements for HTML documents prepared at
Sandia National Laboratores.
These requirements are an attempt to maintain document consistency,
provide some configuration management hooks,
automatically insert links between documents and
identify document ownership within Sandia's Internal Web.
For individuals with access to Sandia's Internal Web, a more complete
<A HREF="http://www-irn.sandia.gov/eve/providers/htmlreq.html">specification</A>
of those requirements is available.
In addition to requirements, that specification also references documents
with style guide suggestions for Sandia HTML authors.
While this Reference Manual attempts to identify the Sandia requirements,
for any conflicts, the specification page on the Internal Web takes precedence.
<P>
In addition to the SGML identification line described in
<a href="#General Syntax">General HTML Syntax</a>,
and the HTML elements and attributes which are required (see
<code><a href="elements.html#ADDRESS">ADDRESS</a></code>, 
<code><a href="elements.html#BODY">BODY</a></code>, 
<code><a href="elements.html#HEAD">HEAD</a></code>, 
<code><a href="elements.html#HTML">HTML</a></code>, 
<code><a href="elements.html#IMG">IMG</a></code>, 
<code><a href="elements.html#META">META</a></code>,
<code><a href="elements.html#LINK">LINK</a></code>,
<code><a href="elements.html#TITLE">TITLE</a></code>),
all documents shall have a &quot;point-of-contact&quot; name
identified in the document as part of the <code>ADDRESS</code>
element that is e-mail enabled by surrounding the name with the
<code><a href="elements.html#A">&lt;A&gt;</a></code> element.
Sandia authors should use Sandia's cgi-bin e-mail program
to generate a mail message submission form
by setting the HREF attribute of the A element to one of the addresses
identified in the Sandia 
<A HREF="http://www-irn.sandia.gov/eve/providers/htmlreq.html">specification</A>
document.
Until all the browsers which the CIO organization of Sandia suppports,
and for which Sandia has a site license, accept the newly emerging
<code>mailto:</code> <a href="#URL">URL</a> access code,
Sandia authors of documents on our Internal web are discouraged
from setting the HREF attribute of the A element to
<code>&quot;mailto:ename@sandia.gov&quot;</code>
This mechanism is acceptable for documents on the external web,
but authors should also display the e-mail address of the
&quot;point-of-contact&quot; name so that manually initiated e-mail
is possible.
<p>
All Sandia documents shall also display a line indicating the
date the document was last modified.  This is usually placed with
the ADDRESS element at either the beginning or end of the document.
Recommended format is: <CODE>Last Modified: 18 Apr 1995</CODE>
<p>
Any Sandia document which is part of
a set of HTML subdocuments which form a sequence or hierarchy should
include two specific <a href="elements.html#LINK">LINK</a> elements
identifying the REL values of <code>next</code> and <code>previous</code>.
In addition, the author should also place icons or text enabled with
the <a HREF="elements.html#A">&lt;A&gt;</a> element
at the beginning and/or end of the BODY section to
make it easy to jump to the document next or previous in the sequence.
Only one <code>next</code> and one <code>previous</code> relationship
may be specified in a document.
<hr>
<H2><A NAME="General Syntax">General HTML Syntax</A></H2>
HTML is an application of
<A HREF="http://www.iso.ch/cate/d16387.html">ISO Standard 8879:1986</A>
-- Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).
SGML is a system for defining structured document types,
and markup languages to represent instances of those document types.
HTML is one such markup language.  Its syntax follows the syntax of SGML.
An HTML file is an file of text whose character set includes [ISO-8859-1]
and agrees with [ISO-10646].
This is often commonly refered to as an ASCII file of text.
This document text also includes instructions
to a user agent (often called a browser) mostly about displaying the text.
To formally identify the file as containing HTML elements,
the beginning of the file should contain a line in SGML syntax
identifying the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/html-spec/catalog">version</a>
of HTML being used.
For RFC 1866 HTML Version 2.0, this line is
<br><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN&quot;&gt;</code><br>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Sandia Requirements</strong>
<dd>
The SGML specification line identifying the file as HTML is required before the
<code>&lt;HTML&gt;</code> element in the file.
It should either specify the version number of HTML to which the file conforms
by using a line like the one above,
or simply specify that the file is HTML by using the line:
<br><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//IETF//DTD HTML//EN&quot;&gt;</code><br>
</dl>

Unless explicitly instructed otherwise, the browser normally
treats all white space that is not a blank
(e.g. tabs, end-of-line characters, etc.) as a single blank,
and collapses multiple white space to a single blank.
Browsers are inconsistent in whether they collapse multiple
line breaks (such as defined by multiple
<code><A HREF="elements#BR">BR</A></code> or
<code><A HREF="elements#P">P</A></code>
elements) into a single line break, but a strict interpretation
of the standard would seem to imply that they should.
<p>
The browser instructions consist of HTML elements
which are HTML element names, optionally followed by HTML attributes,
all surrounded by &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot;
Attributes may be followed by an equals sign and some
&quot;value&quot;.
Some attributes do not define values.
Others take a default if no value is specified.
White space is allowed around the equals sign.
RFC 1866 requires that the &quot;value&quot;
must be surrounded by single or double quotes,
unless the &quot;value&quot; is one of a fixed list of name tokens.
It appears that using quotes is always acceptable, but their
absence is sometimes a problem with some browsers.
The maximum length of &quot;value&quot; (after parsing) is
defined as 1024 characters.
Most HTML elements are designed to surround some content, usually text,
and thus have both a beginning and ending tag.
The ending tag is simply the element name preceded by a &quot;/&quot;
all surrounded by &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot;
HTML names must begin with a letter and are followed by
up to 71 letters, digits, periods, or hyphens.
The standard generally describes the HTML names in upper case,
but (except for <a href="#Special Characters">Special Characters</a>)
browsers are supposed to ignore the case of HTML names.
<p>
Proposals to extend RFC 1866 define a few attributes
to exist on almost every element.
The elements <code>LANG</code> and <code>DIR</code> are
introduced by the internationalization proposal and are designed
to deal with alternative languages.  The syntax and registry of
<code>LANG</code> values is defined by RFC 1766, which is in review
for consideration of changing language codes from two characters
to three characters.  The values of <code>DIR</code> are proposed as
<code>ltr</code> and <code>rtl</code> which would inform the browser
that the language direction of the content is either left-to-right
or right-to-left.
The elements <code>ID</code>, <code>MD</code> and <code>CLASS</code>
are designed for use with style sheets.  The exact details of this
topic are still being discussed and are subject to change.
<hr>
<H2><A NAME="Comments">HTML Comments</A></H2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Description</strong>
<dd>To include comments in an HTML document
that will be ignored by the HTML browser, surround
them with <code>&lt;!--</code> and <code>--&gt;</code>.
After the beginning comment delimiter,
all text up to the next occurrence of <code>--&gt;</code> is ignored.
Hence comments cannot be nested.
However, multiple comments may be included within the 
<code>&lt;!</code> and <code>&gt;</code> delimiters.
Each comment starts with <code>--</code> and
includes all text up to and including the next occurrence of
<code>--</code>.
White space is allowed between the closing <code>--</code>
and <code>&gt;</code>,
but not between the opening <code>&lt;!</code>
and the first <code>--</code>. 

<dt><strong>Minimum Attributes</strong>
<dd><code>&lt;!--characters... --&gt;</code>

<dt><strong>Common Usages</strong>
<dd><code>&lt;!--
<br>characters...
<br>characters...
<br>--&gt;</code>
<dd>or
<br>
<dd><code>&lt;!--characters...--
<br>--characters...--
<br>&gt;</code>

<dt><strong>Variations</strong>
<dd>Not all browsers will properly handle HTML elements
(i.e. an &quot;<code>&lt;</code>&quot) inside of a comment.
Some documents expect any text that
begins with &quot;<code>&lt;!</code>&quot;
to be treated as a comment and do not include the two dashes
at the beginning &quot;<code>&lt;!--</code>&quot;
or the end &quot;<code>--&gt;</code>&quot; of the commented text.
RFC 1866 specifies the double dash at beginning and end as required.
A document using this syntax of missing double dash
is actually coding invalid SGML.
Some browsers will simply ignore these invalid and unrecognized SGML commands,
and thereby give the (misleading) appearance of treating them as comments.
Such browsers will terminate this &quot;comment&quot; upon the first
occurance of a &quot;<code>&gt;</code>&quot;.
Some browsers incorrectly prohibit the double dash &quot;<code>--</code>&quot;
sequence from appearing anywhere within the commented text
except at the end.
<p>
A few early browsers recognized an element
<code>&lt;comment&gt;</code> <code>&lt;/comment&gt;</code>.
RFC 1866 does not include this element, therefore this element should
be considered obsolete.
<p>
There is a proposal to add the SGML comment syntax to HTML elements.
This proposal would begin a comment with a double dash encountered
inside <em>any</em> HTML element (but not inside quotes),
and treat <em>everything</em> as comments
(including any &quot;<code>&gt;</code>&quot;, &quot;<code>&lt;</code>&quot;,
or quote character)
until the next occuring double dash.  Such syntax would not only allow
comments within any HTML element, but HTML elements within a comment.
This proposal is not in RFC 1866.

</dl>
<hr>
<H2><A NAME="Elements">HTML Elements</A></H2>
The complete description of all RFC 1866 HTML elements and all their attributes,
as well as many enhancements, are maintained in a separate Web
<a href="elements.html">document</a> to keep the size of that
document as small as possible.
<dl>
<dt><strong>Sandia Requirements</strong>
<dd>
Sandia HTML developers have specifically
requested that this reference to HTML elements
be formatted as a single document.
This permits them to access the document once while doing document development,
and use the scroll bar to get to all the element descriptions without
need for multiple retrievals.
For browsers which cache files, the internal document hyperlinks
can also be used without need for a further retrievals.
</dl>
<hr>
<H2><A NAME="URL">Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</A></H2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Description</strong>
<dd>Uniform Resource Locators (URL) or Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI)
let you specify how to reach an Internet resource.
They consist of four basic parts:
<code>aaaa://bbb.bbb.bbb/ccc/ccc/ccc?ddd</code>
<dl>
<dt><code>aaaa:</code> The access method.
<dd>This specifies the mechanism to be used by the browser
to communicate with the resource.
Mechanism codes must be registered to be widely recognized.
An X500 mechanism, as well as WHOIS, and Network Database mechanisms
are under study.
Currently recogized mechanisms include:
<dl>
<dt><code>http:</code> HyperText Transfer Protocol
<dd>This is the most commonly used access method.  It requires
a program running on the destination computer that understands
and responds to this protocol.  The file retrieved might be
an HTML file, a graphic file, a sound file, an animation sequence file,
a file to be executed by the server (e.g. cgi-bin files),
or a word processing file.  Whether the file retrieved can be
handled depends on the browser.
<dt><code>https:</code> HyperText Transfer Protocol
<dd>This is a variation on the standard access method designed
to provide some level of security of transmission.
(<i>ed:</i> I am still researching/working on this definition.
Anyone with more details should e-mail me the descriptive URL.)
<dt><code>file:</code> Local File Access
<dd>This method causes the browser to load a file from the
locally accessible disk system.  This is commonly used to
preview Web pages being developed on a computer that has
a browser, but does not have a server.
<dt><code>ftp:</code> File Transport Protocol
<dd>This method uses normal Internet FTP to retrieve
a file.  Most browsers will ask for a location/name on the local
disk system to store the file.
Some browsers will simply display a file that is text.
<dt><code>mailto:</code> E-Mail Form
<dd>The argument following the access code is the destination e-mail address.
If the browser understands this access code, the browser will automatically
generate an input FORM for entering the e-mail message.  It may also
accept additional arguments for default &quot;Subject:&quot; etc.
Most browsers now handle this access code.
Note that any special characters in an e-mail address (e.g. &quot;%&quot;)
must be URL converted (e.g. &quot;%25&quot;)
<dt><code>news:</code> USENET News
<dd>Only argument following the access code is the group or article name.
<dt><code>nntp:</code> Local Network News Transport Protocol
<dd> (<i>ed:</i> I am still researching/working on this definition.)
<dt><code>wais:</code> Wide Area Information Servers
<dd> (<i>ed:</i> I am still researching/working on this definition.)
<dt><code>gopher:</code> GOPHER
<dd> (<i>ed:</i> I am still researching/working on this definition.)
<dt><code>telnet:</code> TELNET
<dd>The arguments following the access code are the login arguments
to the telnet session as <code>user[:password]@host</code>.
<dt><code>cid:</code> Content identifiers for MIME body part
<dd> (<i>ed:</i> I am still researching/working on this definition.)
<dt><code>mid:</code> Message identifiers for electronic mail
<dd> (<i>ed:</i> I am still researching/working on this definition.)
<dt><code>afs:</code> AFS File Access
<dd> (<i>ed:</i> I am still researching/working on this definition.)
<dt><code>prospero:</code> Prospero Link
<dd> (<i>ed:</i> I am still researching/working on this definition.)
<dt><code>x-exec:</code> Executable Program
<dd> (<i>ed:</i> I am still researching/working on this definition.)
</dl>
<dt><code>//bbb.bbb.bbb</code> The Internet node
<dd>This specifies the node on the Internet where the file
is located.
If not included, it defaults to the computer on which the
browser is running, which is appropriate for
access method <code>file:</code>
The node may optionally be followed by a colon and the port number.
Most browsers default to port 80, which is also what most
servers use to reply to the browser.
For access method <code>ftp:</code> the node name may take the form
<code>//user[:password]@host</code>.
Without a user name, the user <code>anonymous</code> is used.
<dt><code>/ccc/ccc/ccc</code> The file path
<dd>This is the pathname of the file to be retrieved, including the
directories, subdirectories, and filename.
A server can specify the &quot;root&quot; of the directory
system recognized by an access type as some subordinate directory.
This restricts access to files subordinate to that directory.
<dt><code>?ddd</code> Arguments
<dd>Depending upon the access method, and the file accessed,
characters can follow the file name, separated by some pre-defined
special character (e.g. &quot;#&quot;, &quot;?&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;, etc.).
This information can then be used by the access method as additional
arguments for the access.  In the case of access method
<code>http:</code> where the file is an executable cgi-bin program
registered with the server, the arguments are passed to the program.
For an HTML document, &quot;#&quot; identifies the fragment name internal
to an HTML document and identified by the <code>A</code> element with
the <code>NAME</code>attribute where presentation will begin.

The ampersand and semicolon delimit an entity name which the user agent
will replace with a special character.
The trailing semicolon is necessary when the character following the

It is never incorrect to include the trailing semicolon.

<dt> <code>&amp;quot;</code>
     <DD> &quot; (quote character)
</dl>

<dt><strong>Variations</strong>
<dd>Some browsers always require the trailing semicolon.
RFC 1866 specifies <code>&amp;quot;</code> as being a double quote,
but some older browsers display it as a single quote.
The remaining special character entity names defined in RFC 1866,
as well as some proposed special character entity names, are listed in
<A HREF="symbols.html"><code>http://www.sandia.gov/sci_compute/symbols.html</code></A>
and can be used to see what they will produce on your browser.
Not all of those special characters are recognized by all browsers.
All entity names are defined as case sensitive.
The entity name of many of the special characters
intentionally includes mixed case which must be entered
exactly as specified.
Since most browsers are insensitive to case for HTML names,
many browsers do not require the entity names of the main four special
characters to be lower case.

<p>
RFC 1866 recommends referencing special characters
with the entity names described above instead of using these numeric
ISO Latin-1 code entity names.

to an image.
The browser may either display them from local code/files, or

<dt><strong>Variations</strong>
<dd>Icon entity names are proposed as an extension to RFC 1866.
Browsers are likely to provide extensions to this set of icon names.

than entity names to access them.
The following document lists the currently proposed icon entity names,
as well as one set of known internal icons:

While there exist a number of <cite>Beginner's Guides</cite>
to writing HTML, verbal descriptions of parts of HTML, and
technical Document Type Definitions (DTD) specifications of the language,
I could not find a concise reference document as a Web page for the language.
This reference document is an attempt to fill that gap.
Judging by the thousands of sites that have accessed this document,
it appears that it is filling a gap for many people.
While I have made every effort to be complete concerning the language,
that is always an unattained goal.
