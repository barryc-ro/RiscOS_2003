 * HtmlParse() is used to initialise the HTML parser for a document

 *                       relative links may be established within the
 *                       document.
 *   (int) length      - The total length of the document (if known).
 *                       This is used oven the chunk size argument for
 *                       hourglass % calculation if it is non-zero.
 *   (int) type        - The type as defined in the return value from
 *                       HtmlIdentify. Typically this is 1 for HTML
 *                       and 2 for plain text (this ensure plain text
 *                       is PRE-formatted)
 *   (int) frames      - If the front end is displaying frames, this
 *                       should equal 1. This will suppress NOFRAMES
 *                       data. Otherwise set to 0.
 *   (int) objects     - If objects should be parsed, 1, else 0.
 *   (int) tables      - If tables should be parsed, 1, else 0.
 *   (int) encoding    - The identifier of the encoding in use.
 *   (enco...)priority - The priority of that encoding choice.

 *                        not supported
 *   (int) size         - size of the chunk added.
 *   (int *) flags      - output destintation for reported flags
 *
 * The HStream returned is either
 *
 *    a) NULL if no new tokens are produced
 *    b) the first new token produced (if we weren't in a table to start with)

 * response codes dont they :)
 *
 * If it is an HTML or text file, an encoding number is returned in
 * *encoding - 0 if the encoding is not specified.
