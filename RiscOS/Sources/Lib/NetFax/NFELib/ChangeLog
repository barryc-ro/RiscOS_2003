Version:	0.48
Date:		1998-05-27
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_NFELib-0_48

Fixed small memory leak on sending email messages with only one entity
(attachment) in them.

Corrected error where message class header presence was not checked for in
a received message before trying to extract the information.  Would therefore
give random NetFax Message Class values on messages with no
X-NetFax-Message-Class header.

CVS tag:	rwarren_NFELib-0_47

C++FLAGS changed in Makefile to remove function names from the object code.
Saves a bit of code space.  Corrected ChangeLog file component description,
etc.

===============================================================================
Version:	0.46
Date:		1998-05-27
Name:		Richard D. Warren
CVS tag:	rwarren_NFELib-0_46

Fixed creation of document number in Message-ID header.  Wasn't treating it
as a unsigned value, so it went negative! - PAN-02052.
