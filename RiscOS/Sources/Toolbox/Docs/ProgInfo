New ProgInfo class version is 1.01.  Module version now 0.10.  (Requires
ResEd 0.42 for editing of ProgInfo objects in Res files).  New resize source
file added for automatic ProgInfo resizing, plus updated resource files to
contain Web site button templates.  (www.internal/~sbrodie/pi-changes.txt)
Auto-resize disabled if component IDs in underlying Window object are wrong.

Fixed memory leak which caused URI buffers to be left around when objects
were deleted at task closedown.

German version of Resource file added to CVS.  This is required for anybody
using the German version of RISC OS to prevent weird errors and aborts when
using the updated ProgInfo modules (>0.09)
