Toolbox memory allocator now uses a dynamic area under RISC OS 3.5 and later.
New SWI (Toolbox_Memory) added for object modules to access the allocator.

Ensured that filename passed to MessageTrans_OpenFile is stored in RMA.
Made the Toolbox look for Res<territory> then Res, rather than Res then
Res<country>. Ditto for Messages.

Service_ToolboxTaskBorn issued once for each task instead of multiple times for
the same task when new object modules register.


SWI dispatcher fixed to dispatch Toolbox_Memory calls - this prevented
version 1.39 from providing the advertised memory services to the other
object modules.

Object ID validation is now performed by the Toolbox module itself
instead of the slow OS_ValidateAddress SWI call.  This is possible for
both the normal RMA usage and dynamic area usage since the Toolbox
knows the dynamic area address range (it reads the RMA details for RISC
OS 3.1 machines with OS_ReadDynamicArea on every access but that can't
be helped).

Event ordering problems fixed (SNB-U002).  Needs Window 1.51's
co-operation for this to work properly.
Version number now maintained by srccommit.

New null pointer check added to make sure that the Toolbox module no
longer data aborts if the application's Messages file cannot be found.
