Notes
=====

The FontMenu_HasBeenHidden event will only be delivered when the complete
menu tree is closed, or just before different submenu in the tree is
shown.

Note that it is possible, if you have multiple shared FontMenu objects
attached to a menu, that FontMenu_HasBeenHidden events will be delivered
with the wrong parent component ID.
