Building ToolboxLib under CVS
=============================

1. Introduction
---------------

Some of the notes in the 'Building' file still apply, in particular the sections
on generating the source files, editing toolboxlib and setting the version
number.


2. Generating the makefile
--------------------------

Makatic3 is used to automatically generate and execute the Makefile for
toolboxlib.  The 'sources' directory is recursively scanned and for each .c file
a corresponding .o file is added to the list of objects used to build
toolboxlib.  This means that you cannot place unused source files anywhere in
the 'sources' directory; I have created an 'unused' which exists alongside the
sources directory to contain any unused source files which I encountered while
creating this build system.


3. Building toolboxlib
----------------------

This is much the same as building any other component in the Renaissance build
environment.  To build a local copy, double-click on the !Mk file.  To include
toolboxlib in a system build include it in the components file as you would any
other library.

Cheers,
