Simple Gadget Support
=====================

when it comes to 'simple' gadgets, ie. ones that consist of one or two icons
and a block of memory describing their attributes, there is a certain amount
of commonality. Eg. when deleting the gadget, the icons should be deleted and 
the block of memory freed. For this purpose the routines simple_XX are used by
all the simple gadgets. They assume only one block of memory (which should be
the case for all gadgets as the maximum amount of memory for strings etc. is
allocated on creation) and that the private data is like:

        {
                int icon1;
                int icon2;
                int icon3;
                .....
        }
