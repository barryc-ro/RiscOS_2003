Fixed bug in toolbox's implementation of Gadget_GetIconList - didn't
fill in the last icon number in the user buffer. Not to worry though,
only took a few hours to find.

Fixed mouse pointer reappearing if turned off when mouse leaves a window -
  fixes a bug on NC/STB devices where the mouse pointer is generally off.
Changed writablefield_set_value to update the icon with Wimp_SetIconState
  rather than Wimp_ForceRedraw. This makes it look nicer, but has the
  unfortunate side-effect of making Java's dialog benchmark go at around 40%.
  Left code in, but #define'd out, so still works the original way.
Fixed labelbox gadget if the label text matches a sprite in the wimp pool -
  it used to display that sprite and the text.

Fixed it so that writable icons "inherit" the Gadget_Faded flag from numeric
  fields, string sets etc. during a Gadget_SetFlags.  The lack of this was
  meaning that linked writables in numeric fields etc. were continuing to
  behave the same way as they were when created, even when gadgets had been
  faded/unfaded - meaning that the caret could be placed in shaded icons,
  for example...
Potentially this should be fixed so that this always takes place during
  fade/unfade operations, not just for writable icons - but I haven't done
  that.
