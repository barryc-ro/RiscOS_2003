Added SWI Window_EnumerateGadgets (0x82880+10)

On entry:
	r0 = flags
	r1 = Wimp window handle
	r2 = -1 to start from first gadget, otherwise value returned from previous call.
	r3 = pointer to buffer or 0 to get required size
	r4 = size of buffer, or unused if r3=0
	
On exit:
	If r3 on entry is 0:
		r4 = required buffersize (-1 if r1 is not a toolbox window).
	If r3 on entry is non-0:
		r2 = value to pass on to next call in r2. 0 if no more.
		r4 = num bytes written to buffer (-1 if r1 is not a toolbox window).
	All other registers preserved.

Added SWI Window_GadgetGetIconList (0x82880+11)

On entry:
	r0 = flags
	r1 = wimp window handle
	r2 = gadget component id
	r3 = pointer to buffer or 0
	r4 = size of buffer
	
On exit:
	r4 = size of buffer required to hold icon list (if r3 was 0)
		 else buffer pointed to by r3 holds list of Wimp icon numbers for this gadget
		 and r4 holds number of bytes written to buffer.
	r4 = -1 if r1 isn't a toolbox window.

This behaviour is the same as that of Gadget_GetIconList (User Interface
Toolbox p 334) except for using different registers and taking in a wimp
window handle instead of a window object id. Also, it can be called by
any task.

Fixed bug in toolbox's implementation of Gadget_GetIconList - didn't
fill in the last icon number in the user buffer. Not to worry though,
only took a few hours to find.
