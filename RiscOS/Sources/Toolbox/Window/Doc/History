-- version 1.39 --

10 Jul 1997	JSmith

Added SWI Window_EnumerateGadgets (0x82880+10)
Added SWI Window_GadgetGetIconList (0x82880+11)


10 Jul 1997	JSmith

Fixed bug in toolbox's implementation of Gadget_GetIconList - didn't
fill in the last icon number in the user buffer. Not to worry though,
only took a few hours to find.


-- version 1.40 --

19 Aug 1997	Piers

Fixed mouse pointer reappearing if turned off when mouse leaves a window -
  fixes a bug on NC/STB devices where the mouse pointer is generally off.
Changed writablefield_set_value to update the icon with Wimp_SetIconState
  rather than Wimp_ForceRedraw. This makes it look nicer, but has the
  unfortunate side-effect of making Java's dialog benchmark go at around 40%.
  Left code in, but #define'd out, so still works the original way.
Fixed labelbox gadget if the label text matches a sprite in the wimp pool -
  it used to display that sprite and the text.

-- version 1.41 --

26 Aug 1997	Piers

Re-implemented StringSet_SetFont - somewhere along the lines the method
  disappeared. I blame the lack of source management a year ago, and I've
  only just noticed :-)

-- version 1.42 --

23 Oct 1997	Piers

Re-compiled with the ROM flags set correctly, so correctly RMEnsures
other modules on startup. Incremented version number since version 1.42
was released to people (on the Acorn World '97 CD ROM)

-- version 1.43 --

22 Oct 1997	BAvison

Fixed it so that writable icons "inherit" the Gadget_Faded flag from numeric
  fields, string sets etc. during a Gadget_SetFlags.  The lack of this was
  meaning that linked writables in numeric fields etc. were continuing to
  behave the same way as they were when created, even when gadgets had been
  faded/unfaded - meaning that the caret could be placed in shaded icons,
  for example...
Potentially this should be fixed so that this always takes place during
  fade/unfade operations, not just for writable icons - but I haven't done
  that.

-- version 1.44 --

15 Jan 1998     SBrodie

Fixed PAN-01317.  If a toolbox task died whilst Window was showing an object
  transiently, the Wimp would die with Illegal window handle errors due to
  the Window module having called SWI Wimp_DeleteWindow whilst the Wimp
  thought that the window was the current menu.

-- version 1.45 --

04 Feb 1998     SBrodie

Uses new Toolbox_Memory SWI (Toolbox 1.40 and later).  Makefile tidied up
and can build RAM versions of this module easily.


-- version 1.46 --

11 Feb 1998     SBrodie

When writable gadgets are passing the caret in to the next writable because
they are faded, they generate NoMoreGadgets errors instead of the rather
cryptic "Invalid component ID (0xffffffff)".


-- version 1.50 --

24 Apr 1998	Piers

Fixed setpointer - setting the pointer back to default incorrectly set the
shape to pointer 2, rather than 1.

-- version 1.51 --

11 Jun 1998	SBrodie

The flushing of pending HasBeenHidden event code which I added in version
1.49 (see CVS logs) was issuing the events in an unfortunate order - just
after the next AboutToBeShown event.  This confused some clients who weren't
counting events.  With the help of Toolbox 1.42 and later, this problem is
fixed.

-- version 1.52 --

11 Jun 1998	SBrodie

Event ordering for transient submenu objects fixed (SNB-U002).
I missed one call to _hide_raise_hidden which resulted in problems with
non-transient windows in 1.51, which strangely decided to hang on until 1.51
was committed before revealing themselves.  These are now fixed.

-- version 1.53 --

16 Jun 1998     SBrodie

Alteration made to handling of SWI Window_PlotGadget so that errors
generated by external gadget modules are detected correctly and the
bounding box of the gadget isn't drawn in addition to the gadget.
Change does not affect gadget modules' API to Window.  Fail-safe
behaviour of drawing the bounding box if Window is not sure whether the
plot call succeeded is retained.


-- version 1.54 --

25 Jun 1998     SBrodie

Radio button gadgets didn't cope with being given empty label field,
hence attempted various pieces of memory copying through null pointers
and memory allocation/deallocation of zero lengths blocks.  Its
handling of its text buffer has been altered to bring it into line with
the way all the other built-in gadgets handle their label buffers -
which works.


-- version 1.55 --

24 Jul 1998     SBrodie

Labelled box gadgets now move/resize correctly - it used to rely on the
default move routine - which isn't sufficient.
