Added SWI Window_EnumerateGadgets (0x82880+10)
Added SWI Window_GadgetGetIconList (0x82880+11)

Fixed bug in toolbox's implementation of Gadget_GetIconList - didn't
fill in the last icon number in the user buffer. Not to worry though,
only took a few hours to find.


-- version 1.40 --

19 Aug 1997	Piers

Fixed mouse pointer reappearing if turned off when mouse leaves a window -
  fixes a bug on NC/STB devices where the mouse pointer is generally off.
Changed writablefield_set_value to update the icon with Wimp_SetIconState
  rather than Wimp_ForceRedraw. This makes it look nicer, but has the
  unfortunate side-effect of making Java's dialog benchmark go at around 40%.
  Left code in, but #define'd out, so still works the original way.
Fixed labelbox gadget if the label text matches a sprite in the wimp pool -
  it used to display that sprite and the text.
