         Readme for password filter auxiliary app for NCFresco
         =====================================================


  This little module allows a password typed on a webpage to issue a *
command.  It was originally written to password protect the ISPCapture
screens on an NC product, but it should be possible to use it in other
situations, as the behaviour can be customised by passing options into the
build, via the components file.

Definitions for components file:
PassFilter   -options CONFIG=resources:$.Apps.!Boot.Config

  That's all,
