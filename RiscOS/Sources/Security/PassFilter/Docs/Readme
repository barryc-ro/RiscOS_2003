         Readme for password filter auxiliary app for NCFresco
         =====================================================


  This little module allows a password typed on a webpage to load another
webpage.  It was originally written to password protect the ISPCapture
screens on an NC product, but it should be possible to use it in other
situations, as the behaviour can be customised by passing options into
the build, via the components file.

Definitions for components file:

PASSWORD    - Set this to the password to want to use.
ENABLE_URL  - Set this to the URL of the page you want to be able to type
              the password from.
GOTO_URL    - Set this to the URL you want to visit once the password has
              been typed correctly.

  That's all,
