         Readme for password filter auxiliary app for NCFresco
         =====================================================


  This little module allows a password typed on a webpage to issue a *
command or open a URL.  It was originally written to password protect the
ISPCapture screens on an NC product, but it should be possible to use it in
other situations, as the behaviour can be customised by passing options into
the build, via the components file.

PassFilter

  That's all,
