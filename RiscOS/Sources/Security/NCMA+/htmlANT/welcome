<center><h1>Welcome to the Network Computer</h1><br>
We'd just like to say a big thanks for giving us your money!</center></p>
<hr>
<p>We'd like to get you up and running as quickly as possible to ensure maximum
enjoyment of your NC before the inevitable feelings of vague disappointment
set in. </p>
<p>Before we can do that, we need to ask you a bewildering array of
confusing and byzantine configuration questions, before getting you to sign
up for an internet service contract that's extremely binding, permanent, and
inflexible, and which will end up costing you money on a regular
basis long after you've grown bored with the NC itself. </p>
<p>But hey, that's why
we give 'em away free!</p>
