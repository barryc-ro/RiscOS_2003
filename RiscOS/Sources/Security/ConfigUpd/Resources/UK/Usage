Usage of test harnesses.

This document outlies the use of the test harnesses for the Configuration
Update Module as they presently stand.

Currently a series of files are exported into the ResourceFS:$.Resources.
ConfigUpd directory in the build. These will eventually be placed in a 'Test'
directory on the build machine and *not* exported during the resources build
phase, but it is convenient for the moment to do things this way.

There are two Basic programs in the directory:
	* Passwords. This basic program reads the NCMARegistrationServer-
Password and ISPCAccessPassword NVRAM tags and displays the current vales of
these tags via *memoryi. It also reads the Registration_PSTN_Num, ISP_NAME
and BOOTBLOCK_WRITTEN bootblock atgs and displays those. This program is very
handy to check whether the CU system has written tags.
	* Test. A very simple BASIC program that will call the two CU SWI's
in turn (one to pass a file in, and the other to write te current
configuration out). Only in here so that I can remember the current syntax
for these calls.

There are also four test CU files:
	* infile. A standard Pace dial-in account.
	* infile2. A slightly-altered Pace dial-in account. The Default
bootblock values are very different, and hence, a delete-poweron will cause
the unit to to connect.
	* infileInc. A test for the incremental update bootblock flag. This
file only alters three tag values.
	* Netcomm. A netcomm account.
