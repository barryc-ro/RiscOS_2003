    This document specifies the NDS support library, which supplies the OS framework

    <H2><A NAME="outstanding">2. Outstanding issues</A></H2>

    <P>
    The current taskwindow based model may not be satisfactory because of the implicit
    latencies involved.  This needs investigating in the context of a running STB to see
    whether other applications, most notably the browser, seriously impact upon the
    performance of the verifier to the extent that video descrambling can no longer take
    place.
    <P>
    At present some of the COM port API has been implemented as empty functions as it is
    not clear what they should do.  This should be resolved as dialogue with NDS
    continues.
    </P>

    <!-- ******************************************************************************** -->
    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="technical">3. Technical background</A></H2>

    <P>
    The DSL4000 is required to display MPEG content which has been scrambled using
    the NDS conditional access system. This requires that various software is
    implemented to support the descrambling process.
    </P>

    <P>
    On a DSL4000 system, the MPEG data is usually passed directly from the MPEGControl
    module to the MPEGDriver module. For descrambling, an intermediate step will be
    required for those parts of the stream which have been scrambled.
    </P>

    <P>
    This specification documents the support software library for the NDS verifier code
    which relies upon a multi-threading scheme.
    </P>

    <P>
    RISC OS doesn't have any explicit support for multithreading.  Applications usually
    run with a single thread of execution, and have a single event queue (accessed through
    Wimp_Poll).  To facilitate multiple threads of execution within the C runtime
    environment, a new stack must be created for each thread.  Context switching is then
    accomplished by restoring the register set of the thread to be switched to, which will
    include the stack pointer for that thread.
    </P>

    <P>
    To make the context switching preemptive, and allow threads to block on certain IO
    events, the proposed scheme runs each thread under a TaskWindow.  Certain enhancements
    have been made to the TaskWindow and DeviceFS modules which make them much more
    efficient for this use:  DeviceFS will now issue OS_UpCall 6 when it is blocking,
    this is trapped by a program running in a TaskWindow an allows multitasking to
    continue.  Threads share the same address space due to being resident within a module,
    the C heap having been initialised within a dynamic area so as not to be paged out
    upon task switching.
    </P>

      <P>
      Called to create a process, queue and so on, as required by used OS.
      Stores data in format allows access to process queue using process_handle
      priority_index is an index in priority list so ECM task will have highest
      priority.

      <P>
      This has been implemented by starting a taskwindow with a command which
      enters the module with an argument pointing to a new stack to use, with
      the address of the thread's main function at the top of the stack.

      <P>
      Queues are implemented as buffer manager buffers, and one is allocated
      when the thread starts.

      <P>
      Threads are managed by a Wimp Task which is started when the module's
      entry point is called without any arguments.

      <P>
      OS UpCall 6 is called with the queue_count for the task as a pollword. 
      When data is present it is removed from the buffer.  This means that at
      present data could be inserted into the buffer without waking up the
      task, as it relies upon NDS_OS_Send_Message to increment the

      <P>
      Semaphores are implemented as words in the shared heap.  They are used

      The semaphore handle is made non-zero and OS_UpCall 6 is called with 0

      <P>
      OS_UpCall 6 is called with the semaphore as a pollword, until the
      semaphore is non-zero.  Then the semaphore is zeroed (so that it is

    <H3>5.2. COM port Library calls</H3>
    The COM port library calls are quite simple veneers onto the OS device
    calls, and as such are not outlined here in full.

    The NDS support code consists of a partial module which calls a function     'InitVerifier' and supplies the above mentioned functions.  It is then
    linked against a binary object file compiled with the -zM option and runs
    as a module.

    <P>
    There are two possible extensions to the architecture designed:

    <P>
    Rather than having to place the code in a module and move the C heap into
    a dynamic area, some scheme could be developed which coerced the Wimp to
    allow multiple tasks to be initialised in the same memory domain. This would
    allow the code to be compiled as a normal application, although a new OS call
    would be required to start a new task in the same domain.

    <P>
    Using taskwindows means that the threads are restricted in latency by any
    of the other applications running on the computer.  A more reliable quality
    of service could be achieved by the architecture emplying its own Callback
    handler which paged in the threads according to system events.  Threads could
    then preempt whatever Wimp task was currently active.  This would be
    complicated by the requirement to page the task in as suggested in the first
    extension, but would be relatively simple using the current design which uses
    permanently paged in memory.
