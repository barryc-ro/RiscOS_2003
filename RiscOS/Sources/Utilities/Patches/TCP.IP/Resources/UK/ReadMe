TCP/IP Protocol Suite Release 2 upgrade
=======================================

The Protocol modules supplied with TCP/IP Protocol Suite release 2 will
not function correctly on a StrongARM-equipped computer. This directory
contains files that allow you to upgrade the protocol modules so they
will work correctly.

To upgrade your existing !Protocols:

 * Make a copy of your existing !Protocols application and place it
   somewhere safe.
 * Drag the !Protocols application in this directory onto your original
   !Protocols application.
 * Restart your machine to ensure that the new protocol modules are
   loaded.
