PC Emulator upgrade
===================

Existing PC Emulators will not work in the new screen modes available on
RISC OS 3.5. This directory contains files that allow PC Emulator versions
1.81, 1.82, 1.83 to be updated to PC Emulator version 1.86 which will work
on RISC OS 3.5. Note that there is no advantage in upgrading to PC Emulator
version 1.86 unless you use the PC Emulator on a RISC OS 3.5 machine.

To upgrade your existing PC Emulator:

 * Create a new directory in the root of your hard disc (eg. called PC).
 * Place a *copy* of your existing PC Emulator in this new directory ($.PC)
   on your hard disc.
 * Drag the !PCEm in this Patch directory over the newly created copy of
   your existing !PCEm.

Note
----
Applying this patch will lose the PCEm configuration information in your
existing PCEm (in the new default configuration file the graphics adaptor is
set to VGA). Existing users of the PCEm should therefore make a note of
their configuration before applying this patch. New users of the PCEm should
apply this patch before configuring the PCEm. 

On RISC OS 3.5 machines it is usually possible to configure the PC Emulator
for VGA emulation, and this is almost always the most best choice (as
mentioned above VGA is now selected in the default configuration file).

On Acorn machines with new style keyboards (those with the Ctrl key at the
bottom left) DOS should be configured for a UK enhanced keyboard. The
default is US enhanced keyboard and with this incorrect setting some keys
will be wrongly placed (eg. " and \).

There is a bug in the resulting patched emulator that makes PC screen snap
shots (Save sprite menu entry) taken in 16 and 32 bits per pixel RISC OS
screen modes faulty. The work around is to change to an 8 bit per pixel or
lower RISC OS screen mode before using the Save sprite facitity.
