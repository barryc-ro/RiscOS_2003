Alternative SoundDMA Relocatable Module
=======================================

If you use a Risc PC without VRAM fitted to play movie clips with !ARMovie
or !ARPlayer, you may find that in some screen modes such as 800 x 600 in
256 colours, even the 12.5 fps clips run with occasional lack of smoothness.
The simplest ways to avoid this are to use a smaller screen mode, use
!ARPlayer to play on the whole screen in 'big mode', or upgrade your machine
by fitting VRAM. An alternative is to use the SoundDMA relocatable module
supplied in this directory. This can help movie smoothness, but at the
expense of potential performance problems when using sound at the same time
as such serial or parallel port-intensive tasks as modem use or printing.

A version 1.48 (03 Mar 1995) of the SoundDMA relocatable module is contained
in your RISC OS 3 version 3.60 system ROMs. SoundDMA 1.49 (25 May 1995) is
supplied here. To use SoundDMA 1.49 (see the advantages and disadvantages
above) copy the complete subdirectory entitled 'SoundDMA' in this directory
into the directory $.!Boot.Choices.Boot.PreDesk, which will cause it to be
loaded every time you start your machine.
