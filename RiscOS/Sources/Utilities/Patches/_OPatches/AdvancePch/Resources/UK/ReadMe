Advance WordProcessor upgrade
=============================

Advance Word Processor version 0.77 (17-Feb-93) will not display documents
properly in all the new screen modes available on RISC OS 3.5. It also will
not insert sprites defined in the new screen modes into word processor
documents. This directory contains files that allow you to upgrade AdvanceWP
to version 0.79 (15-Feb-94) which will work on RISC OS 3.5. Note that there
is no advantage in upgrading to AdvanceWP version 0.79 unless you use
Advance on a RISC OS 3.5 machine.

To upgrade your existing AdvanceWP:

 * Create a new directory in the root of your hard disc (eg. called Advance).
 * Place a *copy* of your existing !Advance application in this new directory
   ($.Advance) on your hard disc.
 * With the Shift key pressed, double click on this new copy of !Advance to open
   a directory display showing its contents, including the Advance applications
   !AdvanceDB, !AdvanceGR, !AdvanceSH and !AdvanceWP. 
 * Drag the !AdvanceWP in this Patch directory over the copy of !AdvanceWP
   in $.Advance.!Advance viewer.

If you have a site licence copy of Advance (SKY77 or SKY78) and have
installed it on a network fileserver, logon with system privilege and update
copies of AdvanceWP on your network in a similar way to above.
