This directory contains new installation programs for Desktop C and Desktop
Assembler.  These applications should be used instead of those supplied on
the Desktop C/Assembler discs.

Notes about installation
------------------------

When installing Desktop C an error will be produced at the end of the
installation, informing you that it cannot find the RISC_OSLib messages
file.  This can be found in the C directory and should be copied into
$.RISC_OSLib.

Both the C and Assembler products will install another !Boot application in
'$.DDE'.  To allow automatic running of this boot file you will need to copy
it into your !Boot application in the root directory of your harddisc. 
Running the obey file 'MoveBoot' after installation will do this for you.
This will remove the !boot file from the '$.DDE' directory.
