   Install
   ~~~~~~~

   Purpose: to install Acorn Desktop C

   Version: 2.11

   Description:
                                                  
   Install will install the 'C' system onto your currently selected 
   filing system and drive. To alter this change your currently 
   selected file system and drive before you run Install again.

   Install supports installation onto hard or floppy discs, and 
   onto a network (NETFS).

   Note that Install builds the !Boot application in your DDE
   directory, as well as copying other files, so copying files
   manually does not produce the same result as running Install.

   WARNING: with Force overwrite enabled, the installation process
   overwrites existing files whose names are duplicated by new ones.
   This is intended to ensure that earlier versions of, for example,
   the compiler in your library directory, are consistently updated.

   Click on RUN to start the install process.
