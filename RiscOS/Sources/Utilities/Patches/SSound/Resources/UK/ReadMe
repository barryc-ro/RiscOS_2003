This directory contains version 0.24 of SharedSound

  SharedSound version 0.23 or earlier will not work with
  Acorn's StrongARM processor.
  Version 0.24 replaces earlier versions of the module with
  full StrongARM compliance.
  This version has been supplied by ESP for use and distribution
  with any Acorn and third party applications that require
  SharedSound.

To use this patch, simply ensure that !System contains this
version of SSound in preference to any old one. SSound typically
resides in !Boot.Resources.!System.Modules
