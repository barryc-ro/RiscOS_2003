# Patch to allow RISC iX 1.1 to boot on RISC OS 3.

# The existing code in the boot modules does an OS_Byte 129 to read
# the operating system version number, and refuses to boot if it is not
# one of the versions it knows about. The code concerned is approximately:

#   switch (os_version)
#   {
#   case &A0:                           /* Arthur 1.20 */
#   case &A1:                           /* RISC OS 2.00 */
#       break;
#
#   default:
#       panic("Unknown machine hardware");
#   }

# Since RISC OS 3.00 returns &A3 for the os_version, RISC iX fails to
# boot. (&A2 is returned by RISC OS 2.01, which was only fitted to the
# A540/R260/R225 and anyway the R260 and R225 ship with RISC iX 1.2.)

# This patch modifies the default: statement to allow RISC iX 1.1 to boot
# with any RISC OS version number.

# The machine code changed is:

#       ADRNE   r0, "Unknown machine hardware"
#       BLNE    panic

# to:

#       BNE     continue_booting
#       BLNE    panic

# There may be some other versions of these modules (eg. 1.13 and 1.15?).
# These versions (if they exist) may need different patches. The chances
