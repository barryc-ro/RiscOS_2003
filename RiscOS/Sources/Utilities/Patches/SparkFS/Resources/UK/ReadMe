SparkFS 1.28 upgrade kit   25-Jun-96

The contents of this archive allow you to upgrade a copy of SparkFS 1.27 to
1.28. To do this, simply copy the !SparkFS directory in the archive onto a
copy of SparkFS 1.27.

The sole aim of this upgrade is Strong ARM compatability - 1.28 will work,
1.27 won't.

Note that the !Run file will be overwritten and so if you've made any
changes to that, you may prefer to copy the files across by hand. The only
change I have made to !Run is to increase the wimp slot from 96K to 128K.

The two components which won't work on the SA are the main !RunImage and the
ImageFSFix module. It is worth noting that ArcFS has a module with the same
name and function (but different code). At any rate beware of the
possibility that old versions of this module are loaded in boot files etc.

This upgrade is very much a quick patch. Work on SparkFS does go on, and you
may like to consult the web site below to see what the current version is.

If you have a copy of SparkFS older than 1.27, then you probably should get
a proper upgrade.

The contents of this archive are copyright and only to be used by purchasers
of SparkFS. They must not be modified or used in any way other than to upgrade
a copy of SparkFS 1.27.
