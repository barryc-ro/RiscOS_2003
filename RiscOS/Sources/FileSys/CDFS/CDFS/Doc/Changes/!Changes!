                                       Correction made to file extension facility that allows MSDOS extensions to be

   L1.02       24-8-90   895C          64K Lingenuity SCSI card.
                                       Corrections:  User Root and Library  directories now allowed on each drive, not
                                       just one. *Bye and *shutdown no longer ejects the discs from the drives.  Extra
                                       *command 'PlayMSF' added to allow playing MM:SS:FF. *NoLib, *NoDir, *NoURD added.
                                       If attempt to read an audio disc, then the message 'Cannot read audio discs' is
                                       given.  *CDDevices was improved. The disc icon on the bar was renamed from 'disc'
                                       to 'cddisc' to prevent clashes with applications (!Hyper).  If a disc with no
                                       name was found, then it is now give the name 'NONAME'.
                                       *DIR \ now works ( = *Back )
