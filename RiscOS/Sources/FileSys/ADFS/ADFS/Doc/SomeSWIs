Description of ADFS_ECCSAndRetries

This SWI is for internal use only.

In RISC OS 3.10:
; In:
;  -
; Out:
;  r0 = 0
;  r1 = number of ECCs taken
;  r2 = number of errors taken

In RISC OS 3.31/ADFS 2.90 and later:
; In:
;  r0 = &43434578 ("xECC")
;         Use Engineering mode for verifies
;     = other
;         Don't use engineering mode for verifies
; Out
;  r0 = 0
;  r1 = number of ECCs taken
;  r2 = number of errors taken

Prior to 3.31/2.90 Engineering mode was always used for verifies.
