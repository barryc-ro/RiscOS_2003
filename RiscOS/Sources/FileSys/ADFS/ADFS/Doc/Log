Temporary log of changes to ADFS - see +Log for official list.

Version 2.14

*  Fixes to *Format:
        help on format no longer refers to L/D/E
        Format defaulting to E fixed.
        Aborting the format before it starts no longer dismounts a
                (sometimes random) disc
        Acceptance of number of parameters no matches the number of
                parameters it should accept.
        Y option re-installed
        Escape at the 'Are you sure' prompt now returns an escape error and
                acknowledges the escape.
        The key typed at 'Are you sure' is now reflected on screen.
        Escape during format now gives 'this disc is duff' extended escape
                error message as it did before.
        Number of tracks to be formatted now displayed before format starts.
        If no name is given for the disc one is generated as before.
        Parameters of the format reflected to the user before the 'Are you
                sure' prompt.
        Mapping out defect message now displays on new line after Format track <n> message.

Version 2.16

 *  Tidy up NewLines during *Format:
        NewLine after error from DiscOps not covered by Disc error handling
        NewLine at end of format sequence.

Version 2.17

 *  Fix bug whereby misc_mount assumed it was given a buffer where this
        assumption wasn't necessarily so.
 *  Enhance description of derivation of formats.

Version 2.18

 *  Multi-floppy fixes
 *  5 1/4-floppy fixes

Version 2.19

 *  Fix mounting to assess lowsector properly

Version 2.20

 *  Fix mounting on 1772 to correctly fill in sequence sides on L style
floppies.

Version 2.21

 *  Fix *Format to display track count from 1 upwards, rather than 0 upwards.

Version 2.22

 *  Adjust mounting of floppies to take account of some copy protection
        schemes. The change involves taking the sector size from the
        LowSector sector, and only counting sectors of that size when
        determining SecsPerTrk. This avoids embarasment when a protection
        scheme puts a small extra sector onto a track.

Version 2.23

 *  Merge in ADFS14 as changed by Chris Partington:
        Applied fix suggested by Conner to fix problem with CP3044 (and other
        non-CAM drives?): it is impossible to select a drive that is busy and it
        is impossible to determine whether a drive is busy until is has been
        selected. The combined hardware/software fix, which is especially
        necessary when selecting a slave drive after reset, is to pull up the BUSY
        bit on the bus so that it always reads as 1 when neither drive is driving
        the bus and select drives by repeatedly writing to the drive/head register
        when trying to determine whether the drive is busy (changes to
        WinIDEWaitReady).

Version 2.24

 *  Fix WrtTrkOp to correctly handle the case of clients supplying duff
        lengths. Makes ArcDfs work.
 *  Improve disc track layout evaluation to count only those sectors the
        same size as the lowest numbered one which are numbered sequentially
        from the lowest numbered one. This avoids confusion when
        encountering some copy protections schemes, eg the one addopted by
        Chocks Away, which had the following sectors:
                Sector ID       Size
                0               1K
                1               1K
                2               1K
                3               1K
                4               1K
                5               256
                7               1K
        The last 1K sector (which can't be real as there's not enough room
        on a track) confused the old scheme. The scheme is not 100% proof
        against copy protection schemes, but is an improvement.
 *  Put absent hardware detection into the ST506 hard disc driver. The controller
        absent is detectable 'immediately' and a ST506 drive in 30 seconds.

Version 2.25

 *  Replace FIQ routines to improve FIQ latency, remove bug where scatter
        list extension was ignored and improve scatter list advancement to
        be friendlier/faster to FileCore.
 *  Fix *Format to not lose the error from the layout structure operation.
 *  Set DensityWorks even though no action is takne based upon its value.
 *  Add code to *Format to preserve the error to return to the user across
        the tidy-up procedure at the end of *Format.
 *  Fix bug where on 82C710 poll change sequence number was bumped up even
        if the drv_changed state was only caused by the supplied sequence
        number being out-of-sync.

Version 2.26
 *  Shorten message tags to <= 7 characters.

Version 2.51
 *  Check the disc name in the *Format command.

Version 2.52
 *  Verify a sector during mount even if no transfer was requested so that a
        wrong density doesn't get used.

Version 2.61
 *  Frugalise buffer sizes on <= 1M machines to 2K per 1M rather than 4K per
        1M each.
