Make_2,00. The object produced is called Obj.

Version specific filenames are of the following type.

x indicates an A500 version

Make_v,vv is the make file which produces Obj
Hdr_v,vv sets the options for the assembly
Obj_v,vv is an copy of the object that should be produced. A binary comparison
 of Obj with this file is done except for test versions.
