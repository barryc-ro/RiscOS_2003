Information about 82077 trial board

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jonathan,
             A few things to note about the Intel 82077 podule.

The 28 pin flying plug replaces the 1772 on an A400/1 pcb. 
The 14 pin flying plug replaces IC41 (a 74HC00) on the A400/1 pcb [IC46 on
an old A440].

In this way the 82077 INT line goes to FFIQ, the 82077 DRQ line goes to FFIQ and
S1* gets connected to the podule. The 82077 thus resides at the same base
address as the 1772, and the 82077 interrupts replace those of the 1772.


The addresses of the podule are as follows :-

&3310000  ..... base address of 82077 (Status register A)
&3310004  ..... Status register B
&3310008  ..... Digital output reg
   .
  etc
   .
&331001C  ..... Configuration Control register

i.e. the normal floppy controller registers plus the few extras for this chip.

plus ....

&3310040  ..... DACK* (DMA acknowledge)
&3310060  ..... TC (Terminal count) and DACK* 
&3310020  ..... Media ID register  (D0 and D1 reflect media type inserted in drive)




The 82077 is strapped fpr PC-AT type signal polarities which is the mode I
believe it should be  programmed for.


I have wired up a 'Media ID' register to pins 29 and 33 of the floppy drive
so that the code to detect whether a 4MB drive is connected and what media
is inserted can be tried out. (You can use either a 1MB/2MB drive or a 4MB drive).


I have also added a PAL so that the density select signals from the 82077
generate the correct logic levels on pins 2 and 6 of the Citizen 4MB floppy
for 250/300/500/1Mbps. 

NOTE: The Citizen uses the 'old' select encoding for 4MB drives whereas if
we source a drive with the 'new' select encoding then the PAL will not be
needed - this will cause a complication when selecting 300kbps in the
controller i.e. the drive will select 4MB mode.

Mark,
      A few things regarding floppy that have made themselves apparrent
whilst getting the 82077 podule ready. The chip on the podule is an Intel
82077-1 and we only have one of these. The Chips and Technology datasheet
says that the floppy controller in the '731 is software compatible with the
Intel 82077SL. Could you possibly get hold of a couple of 82077SL samples
and an up to date datasheet (buglist?) - the datasheet I gave Jonanthan is a
bit old.

I now realise that the Citizen OSDF 00A 4MB floppy disc drive uses the 'old
style' desity select encoding if we believe their datasheet. This requires a
PAL to be able to drive the drive's density select input pins. The Sony
drive spec gives no indication as to what encoding it uses. The 'new style'
density select encoding allows a direct connection between the floppy disc
controller and the drive. The only advantage of having a PAL would be that
we could still supoort the 300kbps data rate (1.2MB drives), with a direct
connection this is not possible. So we need more info on the Sony.

To implement 4MB floppy support we need  to be able to read in the "media
ID' signals from the drive. IOMD does not currently have 2 input pins for
this function. We could reduce this to 1 pin by having IOMD generate a chip
select and then add an external latch. Alternatively I note that IOMD has a
general purpose chip delect pin -  could we use this?  Has it already been
spoken for or should we save it for a rainy day.

I tried the 4MB Citizen drive in a Heron just running it at 1MB and 2NB -
there were no surprises, it worked fine.

Jonathan,
          The new addressing of the 82077 podule is as below :-

&3310000  ..... base address of 82077 (Status register A)
&3310004  ..... Status register B
&3310008  ..... Digital output reg
   .
  etc
   .
&331001C  ..... Configuration Control register

&3310020  ..... Media ID register  (D0 and D1 reflect media type inserted in drive)


i.e. as before.

plus ....

&3312000 to 332A000 (24k words) ..... DACK* (DMA acknowledge)
&332A000  ..... TC (Terminal count)
