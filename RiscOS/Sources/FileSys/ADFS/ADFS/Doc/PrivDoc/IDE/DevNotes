Problems if don't store number of IDE drives in CMOS

1. How do we handle podule IDE. Need to know, on initialisation, how
   many drives there are (for call to FileCore).

2. IDE drives are allowed to take up to 31 seconds to come ready
   (according to IBM spec.) although HOPI spec. says it should take
   15-20 normally, 40 under exceptional conditions.

3. Cannot disable a drive (minor inconvenience).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. How do drives other than Conner handle remapping of bad blocks? Do
   they at all?
A. It is either like Conner because CAM 2.1 now requires it or they only
   allow format good/format bad. The exception to this is (I think) Sony
   SRD3040C on which format bad is mapped to format alternate.

Q. Does BSY bit mean whole system is busy?
   Can we change drive reg and look at either drive?
A. IBM BIOS suggests not.

Q. When FileCore asks for a read/write of length not divisible by
   sector size, what does it expect returned as the new disc address?
A. What it gets from ST506 driver in response to read 10 bytes is address +
   10.

Q. Is my data-transfer code legit. or do I really need to check DRQ
   for each 16 bits?
A. It is legit. IBM BIOS uses it. CAM 2.1 requires it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. Why does ADFS service_reset code reclaim vectors?
A. Should really test for soft reset first. Works because claim
   vector can handle multiple entries.

Q. Does the ST506 controller have a sector buffer (code implies yes)?
A. Yes - 2.

Q. PWatkinson is suggesting reusing ST506 IRQ bit for IDE: OK?
A. I can't think of any problems provided that it is guaranteed that
   there will never be both ST506 and IDE controllers on the
   motherboard. If one is added via a podule, it will use a different
   bit in IOC. Only one call will ever be made to ClaimDevice with
   this bit.

Q. How will power-saving features be utilised?
A. Use boot block to store commands for power saving - NO, not necessary as
   basic power commands (IDLE, STANDBY) are standardised.

Q. When the spec. for Conner PANCHO says reset is needed to exit SLEEP
   mode, does this mean soft reset as expected or is a hardware reset
   line needed?
A. HOPI and SIERRA specs indicates that a soft reset is sufficient.
