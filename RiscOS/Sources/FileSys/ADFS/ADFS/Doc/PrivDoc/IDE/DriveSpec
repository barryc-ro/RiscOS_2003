Introduction
============

This document describes the features required of an IDE disc drive for it to
work satisfactorily with the IDE driver which has been added to ADFS. It
does not cover any hardware requirements.



Commands used by the driver
===========================

The smallest possible subset of the commands has been used, at the possible
expense of performance, in order to increase the number of drives that can
be used with the driver.

M/O = CAM mandatory/optional
P/B = X = both, P Perth only

M/O P/B Command   Description
 M   X  %00010000 Recalibrate
 M   X  %00100000 Read Sectors with retry
 M   X  %00110000 Write Sectors with retry
 M   X  %01000001 Verify Sectors without retry
 M   X  %01010000 Format Track
 M   X  %01110000 Seek
 M   X  %10010001 Initialise drive parameters
 O   P  %11100011 Enter idle mode
 O   P  %11100010 Enter standby mode
 O   P  %11100101 Check power mode

In addition, the formatter will probably make use of command %11101100,
Identify drive which is an optional command.


Other requirements
==================

- Sector size fixed at 512 bytes or set to 512 bytes by a write of %101xxxxx
  to the drive/head register.

- Sectors numbered from 1.

- Soft reset pulse minimum width must be <= 50 microseconds.

- Following write command (&30), DRQ must be asserted v.quickly (<100us) to
  keep IRQ latency reasonable.

- Following power on/reset/soft reset, drive must come ready within 15
  seconds (see note 1).

- Drive must handle read/write/verify commands of upto 255 sectors. This may
  be changed so refer to source file ConstIDE for current value.

- Drive registers must be valid after error (they must specify where the
  error occurred).

- Defect mapping strategy has yet to be determined. The formatter program
  will handle this.

- Drive must spinup within 15 seconds after autospindown, when used (see
  note 1).


Notes:
  1. This may be changed so refer to source file ConstIDE for current value.
