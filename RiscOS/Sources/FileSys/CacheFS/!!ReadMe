Plan of sources for CacheFS
===========================

        MakeFile
                rm.CacheFS              ; the final module
                CheckIt                 ; check utility
                
        Resources.<Locale>.Messages     ; to go in Resources:$.Resources.CacheFS.Messages
        
        s.CacheFS                       ; makes rm.CacheFS
                s.Declare
                s.MyMacros
                s.MoveBytes
                s.Test
                
        s.CheckIt                       ; makes CheckIt
                s.Declare
                s.MyMacros
                s.Test

        Header files:
                <standard RISC OS headers>
                Hdr:Trace

        Test
                !!Plan                  ; this file explains the development test scheme

CheckIt is a utility which checks the validity of the cache, by
reading the relevant area number from the CacheFS module's workspace
and checking it in the same way as CacheFS's own internal methods.  It
is useful when CacheFS has been run with trace disabled (eg. for speed
reasons), and you're not sure what is wrong with the cache (if
anything).
