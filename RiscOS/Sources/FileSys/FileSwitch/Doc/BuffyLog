Version 2.42 (MBullock - 10 Mar 1999)

 *  Fixed problem with > 67 character filenames in OS_FSControl 26-28.
    buffer now fixed at 256 characters but lengths are now checked.
 
 *  Paths may now be of any length without crashing fileswitch. On some occasions
    errors will be returned for long filenames (usually buffer overflow), but it will
    never crash. This does not stop other code (usually upcall handlers) from crashing
    the machine.
