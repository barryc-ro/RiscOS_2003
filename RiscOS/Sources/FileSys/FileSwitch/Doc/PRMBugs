FSEntry_Func 11 (page 992)

r6 = 0 (cannot specify a context) is wrong. A context can be specified.

OS_FSControl 1 (page 886)

The default library is typically & (this being the default for FileCore
based filing systems), not $.Library as stated in the PRM.

OS_FSControl 11 (page 897)

r2  0 : old filing system to be selected
should read
r2 > 0 : filing system number specified

The following should be noted about OS_FSControl 11:
