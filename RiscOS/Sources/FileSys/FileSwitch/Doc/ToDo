To Do:
------

make sure disc option appears on cat title

International stuff:
1. 8 bit characters in names on *ALL* filing systems !!!
2. Text direction for names.
3. New interfaces for above.
4. Time and date in * commands (info ex fileinfo)
5. Territory_TextToString
6. Uppercasing for UpperCase macro

JC's unusual app$path corrupting linked strings? Maybe caused by memory shortage.
Add namedisc interface
Add 'access level' interface (public/private)
file left open after *load to memory
5069 - daft error message from filer
5140 *OPT 4,n info not handled - Add boot option interface
5148 Moving files to Econet produces error 'File Y not found'
5158 net:!ArmBoot file not found
5159 Heap Full: Fileswitch get area
5163 *Mount interaction - check this
5164 More URD problems with Econet

Ensure don't OS_File 5 on adfs::0.$
New open flag: 'Enable open on disc image' to get adfs::0.$ to open properly

Pending external reponses:
--------------------------
5179 Fileinfo no longer gives hex for file size.
5196 FileInfo does not work as it did before!
