New service calls specific to or used by FileSwitch:

Service_DiscDismounted

This is used by FileSwitch to Unset directories on eht dismounted disc. For
details of this new service call see FileCore.doc.Services

Service_CloseFile (&68)

Purpose:
To request that any module with a file open which is, or is a child of the
named object, that can also be closed without causing too much hassle should
close it. This would be issued to cause, for example, a DOSFS partition file
to be closed by FileSwitch. This doesn't cause problems as the partition
would be spontaneously reopened when needed later.

To issue this service call:
SWI OS_ServiceCall
Entry
r1 = &68 (Service_CloseFile)
r2 = object needing to be closed
r3 = 0

Exit
r1,r2 preserved
r3 = number of files closed as a result of this service call.

The value in r2 should be a pointer to a nul-terminated string which is a
canonical path of the object to be closed.

To respond to this service call:
Entry
r1 = &68 (Service_CloseFile)
r2 = object needing to be closed
r3 = number of files closed so far this service call
Exit
r1,r2 preserved
r3 incremented by the number of files you closed.
The spec of r2 is as above. This service call should not be claimed. If you,
the receiver of this service call, has any file open which is, or is a child
of the named object which you can close without much bother, then this
should be done. Increment r3 by the number of files you closed before
passing this service on.
