RISCOS Ltd notes on FileSwitch
==============================

Author: Justin Fletcher
Date:   26 Mar 1999

Summary
-------
FileSwitch had a number of bugs in it when dealing with long filenames. These
prevented it from performing some operations on files whose components were
greater than 64 characters, or where the total length exceeded 1024 characters.
Limitations have been more strictly adhered to now.
