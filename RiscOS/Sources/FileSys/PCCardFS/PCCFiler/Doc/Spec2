Spec - Part 2 (must be appened to part 1)

Icons will be allocated each time a new PCCardFS filing system is seen.
A card with more than onefiling systems, will always produce Icons in a
consecutive manner.


When a card is removed its Icon/Card Drive No. is not altered.
Likewise when a drive is dismounted there is no change.
However when a Card is Dismounted with the card removed, then the Icon and
Card Drive value is re-claimed, and may be used by another card being inserted.
