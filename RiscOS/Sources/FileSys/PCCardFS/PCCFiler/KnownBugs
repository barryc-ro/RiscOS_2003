 If both cards have the same name, things go badly wrong.
If a card is inserted when another card has the same name,
then it should cause an 'ambiguous name' error, like with
adfs. The text should be :x, and attempting to open a
directory viewer should have the same effect as adfs.

NOTE: Stork has _ONE_ slot, so this is not disastrous (erm, well)!

 Formatting does not work - the star command issued is not
yet supported by PCCardFS. Also, the menu is not put to
rights afterwards.                                                      SEMI-FIXED

 The Free module has been altered to support PCCardFS as
a 'known' filing system. It has _NOT_ been checked into
the source filer, as it is part of Black II, not Black I.               NOT A BUG

 When selecting the 'Format' command, _ALL_ the menu entries
should be greyed out.                                                   FIXED

 If the icon menu is up when a card is inserted, all entries
remain greyed out. Is this style-guide compliant or not??               NOT BOTHERED

 If a memory card is renamed, existing open viewers on the              FIXED
card are not closed. This is incorrect behaviour.

 An unformatted card should display :0 under the icon & behave like
a similarly challenged floppy.                                          FIXED

 The PCCardFS Filer exits incorrectly, & then (at an non-constant later
time, crashes the machine in some manner)                               FIXED

 DOS formatting appears not to work. *MAKE SURE NEW DOSFS LOADED!*

 When a card is renamed/formatted outside of the desktop, the icon on
the icon bar does not take note of the changes.                         FIXED

 The Format->CurrentFormat menu entry is unimplemented.                 FIXED

 Can't cope if more than one slot changes state outside the             FIXED?
 desktop. Think it's to do with poll_changed not working
 properly.

 Unformatted cards w/out a CIS are regarded as 'empty slot'             FIXED

 'Exit'ing the desktop & then reentering via *Desktop doesn't bring
 the PCCardFS filer back.

Killing the Filer module does not kill the PCCardFS filer.              FIXED
