PCMCIA PCCardFS 'to-do' list
============================

This seems to be pretty much completed, but there are
a few areas which seem prone to faults (formatting is
one particular instance...)                                             FIXED (formatting)

  Disc changing is not correctly implemented. I suspect                 FIXED
  that the problem lies in the disc cycle id's, and PCCardFSs
  incorrect interpretation of them.

  Added support for scatter-list read/write operations                  FIXED (well, done anyway)
