The format scheme does NOT allow for the placing of SYSTEM files onto MS-DOS
discs (other than if a particular version is built into the module). The
DOSFS module as it stands will only set a default BOOT block.
Users should use the *BACKUP command to copy system discs after formatting.
(This assumes that *BACKUP will work for MultiFS disc images)

We will have to provide a special command to copy the BOOT-BLOCK, since this
is MS-DOS system dependant (and is not a file, so will not be copied by
any file-transfer).

                *COPYBOOT <src-drive> <dest-drive>

Will load the BOOT-BLOCK from the source drive given, and apply the
information present to the disc in the given destination drive. We should
only copy the 3byte JMP information and 480bytes of boot code across onto
the destination drive (leaving its shape alone).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Since MS-DOS files have no concept of load and exec addresses, but
      explicit time/date information it is possible to get very funny
      time-stamps on MS-DOS files if the file is created with absolute
      load and exec addresses (ie. NOT of the form FFFtttdd dddddddd, where
      "ttt" is the RISC OS file-type and "dd dddddddd" is a 5byte encoded
      time-stamp).
