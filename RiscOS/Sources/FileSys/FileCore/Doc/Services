Service calls introduced with relevance to FileCore:

Service_DiscDismounted (&7D)

Purpose:
Inform modules that a disc has just been dismounted. A module, such as the
Filer, may wish to take action given this activity such as close its
viewers.

To issue this service call:
SWI OS_ServiceCall
Entry
r1 = &7D (Service_DiscDismounted)
r2 = disc which has been dismounted

Exit
regs preserved

The value in r2 should be a pointer to a nul-terminated string of the
following form:
<FS>::<Disc>
Where <FS> is the name of the filing system and <Disc> is the name of the
disc. If the disc has no name then the drive should be filled in instead.
For example, ADFS would issue the service call with these parameters:
r1 = &7D
r2 = "ADFS::MyFloppy"
or, for an unnamed disc:
r1 = &7D
r2 = "ADFS::0"


To respond to this service call:
Entry
r1 = &7D (Service_DiscDismounted)
r2 = disc which has been discmounted
Exit
regs preserved
The spec of r2 is as above. This service call should not be claimed.
