notes on bigmaps stuff

Need to change a large number of functions to understand that free links
are shorter.

FileCore 33

All the map entry handling functions are
changed.  Where a free space entry is being
modified, the function name is now preceded
by 'Free'

so RdLenLinkBits becomes FreeRdLenLinkBits etc
