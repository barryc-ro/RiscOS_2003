OS_FSControl 56

Returns the defect list for an image.  This call is similar to
OS_FSControl 41 but the defect addresses are represented as
64bit word pairs.

On entry

	R0 = 56
	R1 = pointer to name of image (null terminated)
	R2 = pointer to buffer
	R5 = buffer length

On Exit

	R0 - R5 preserved
	
Use
	This call fills the given buffer with a defect list,
	which gives the byte offset to the start of each
	defect.  Each entry in the list is a pair of words
	(l.s. word first) giving the address as a 64bit
	value.  The defect list is terminated by the value
	&20000000 in the m.s. word of any pair.

On Entry

	R0 = 42
	R1 = pointer to name of image
	R2 = l.s. word of byte offset to start of defect
	R3 = m.s. word of byte offset to start of defect

On Exit
	
	R0 - R2 preserved.
