Image Files
----- -----

Image files cannot be more than 2G bytes in size, as with other
files.  As certain FileCore formatting calls make use of image
files, this limits the size of disc which may be formatted by
such methods to 2G bytes in size.  For larger discs, formatting
code will have to lay out the map directly onto the disc using
disc op calls.
