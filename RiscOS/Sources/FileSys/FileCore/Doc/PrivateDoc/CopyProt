Why Using Unused Disc Sectors is a Poor Copy Protection Scheme.
---------------------------------------------------------------

i) It is incredibly easy to break the copy protection.

This short BASIC program will copy such a disc.

10 DIM B% 819200                                :REM Get some space
20 SYS "ADFS_DiscOp",,1,0,B%,819200             :REM Read the entire disc
30 INPUT "Insert the destination disc";A$       :REM Give a chance to swap discs
40 SYS "ADFS_DsicOp",,2,0,B%,819200             :REM Write the entire disc

All the above calls a legal and documented in the Programmer's Reference
Manual. Anybody who even half-heartedly wants to break a copy protection
scheme may well try the above approach as a first guess.


ii) Such a copy protected disc is likely to be corrupted.

Given the copy protection key is hidden in the free space of the disc then
it is possible, should the customer put more files on that disc, that the
free space with the key in it to be used for these files and thus the disc
will become unusable for the original program.


iii) There are better ways to do copy protection.

Should any ISV wish to consult with Acorn about copy protection schemes,
then we can recommend schemes which will be compatible with current and
future platforms and won't be copied by the current implementation of
desktop backup. These schemes also wouldn't be copied by the above program
or simple addaptions of it.
