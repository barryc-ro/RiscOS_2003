Jonathan,
   Ok, 4.254:$.jthackray.disccheck is now the source directory for the disc
checker. You'll probably want to tidy it up a bit, for instance, it doesn't
check trailers against headers, or check that the directory entries don't
overflow the directory for example. It also doesn't handle old directories.
You might also want ot make it handle defects a little better, at the moment
one just finds an extra map entry occurring at the end corresponding to the
number of defective sectors (I think).
   Jon
