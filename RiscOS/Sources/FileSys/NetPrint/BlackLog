Change Log:
===========

Functionality Changes
---------------------

Version: 5.26     06-Jul-90        Bruce Cockburn

  *  Broadcast for names now tries harder.
  *  Errors during opening don't cause lockup with "This printer does not
     support multiple streams".
  *  *PS <thing> that fails doesn't leave the world in an inconsistent state.
  *  Error messages, especially those from binding are much better.
  *  Added new SWI NetPrint_BindPSName, because it was there.
  *  Made *PS and *SetPS more consistent about their exit conditions.
  *  Used Default values to do initialisation with, needed a large change to
     the organisation to get this to work.
  *  Fixed SWI NetPrint_ReadPSName, now gets R1/R2 right on exit.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.27     07-Jul-90        Bruce Cockburn

  *  Fixed occasional "Bad network number" error.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.28     12-Jul-90        Bruce Cockburn

  *  Fixed random exceptions caused by entering user mode during error
     processing in string copying.
  *  Used single quotes in error messages.
  *  Improved the headings of catalogs and examines.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.29     12-Jul-90        Bruce Cockburn

  *  Fixed random exceptions caused by bad use of a buffer address.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.30     17-Jul-89        Bruce Cockburn
    
  *  No changes at all.  This release is totally gratuitous and was caused
     by a panic rather than any changes to the code.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.31 Wed 24-Oct-90        Ran Mokady                    

  *  FileSwitch function interface now NOPs unknown reason codes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.32 Sat 13-Apr-91        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Version support for OS 1.20 removed.  There are now two versions, one
     for OS 2.00 and one for OS 2.50, the latter uses MessageTrans and
     supports the new version of FileSwitch by not implementing *Cat and
     *Ex.  The functionality of *Cat is now available with *ListPS and *Ex
     by *ListPS -full.  Note that the OS 2.00 version supports both
     interfaces to the same code.  Because of the change to using
     MessageTrans some error messages have improved e.g. "Printer 'Vacant'
     (2.235) is busy with 4.20".

  *  Printer servers that support the new style multi-stream interface are
     now EXPECTED to have a large (&500) buffer for receiving data.  Old
     printers are still only expected to have a small (&4C) buffer.

  *  The interface for OS_File (Save) is improved to transmit the data
     directly from the save address rather than copying every single byte to
     the internal buffer, this should improve the speed.

  *  The filing system now implements the unbuffered PutBytes interface, and
     will transmit the data directly from the buffer address if the size of
     the PutBytes transfer is greater than or equal to the buffer size, this
     should improve the speed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.33 Wed 01-May-91        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Fixed a non X form SWI to an X form.

  *  Changed some of the printing of catalog headers etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.34 Wed 05-Jun-91        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Added two new SWIs; ListServers and ConvertStatusToString.

  *  Re-coded *ListPS and *ListPS -full to use the new SWI interfaces.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.35 Tue 25-Jun-91        Jonathan Roach                

  *  Added fsinfo_alwaysopen to info word in FS declaration block.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.36 Mon 05-Aug-91        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Changed the connect protocol interface so that the new lager buffer
     size introduced in version 5.32 is only used if the server sets bits 2
     and 3 of the control byte of the return from connect packet.  In all
     available implementations these bits have been observed to not both be
     set.  Bug RO-6084.

  *  Added a new error number for the error "Printer server 'thang' not
     found", &00010C04.

  *  Left sufficient buffer space for expanding valid arguments of *SetPS
     i.e. eight bytes not seven and then allowed error returns from the
     expansion routine to be returned correctly.  Bug RO-7283.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.37 Tue 27-Aug-91        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  The local error buffer has now been removed completely in the RISC OS
     3.00 version.  Bug RO-7283.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.38 Thu 29-Aug-91        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Replaced the code in the RISC OS 3.00 version to restore *Cat and *Ex,
     had to add the fsinfo_extra word to the FileSystemInfo block.  Bug
     RO-7326.

  *  Changed the code that abandons receptions used in the ListServers code
     so that it doesn't SWI AbandonReceive handles already abandoned so that
     no unnecessary errors are generated so that the finite number of error
     buffers is not as likely to wrap around causing spurious error
     messages.

  *  Fixed the initialisation of the printer server name from CMOS to read
     the correct number of characters (rather than one too many).

  *  Changed the two busy wait loops (BindName and ListServers) to flip in
     and out of user mode and to call a SWI from user mode so that callbacks
     can occur.  Bug RO-7154.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Released in ROM as RISC OS 3.00

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.39 Thu 20-Feb-92        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Changed *ListPS so that it doesn't print the status of the current
     server.  Bug RO-8379.

  *  Changed *PS<CR> so that it no longer re-binds the current name but
     reports the status of the current server, i.e. it does what was removed
     from *ListPS.  Bug RO-8379.

  *  Fixed the BindName so that the receive block that the successful reply
     comes into is actually abandoned.

  *  Revised help and syntax messages to be accurate and more informative.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.40 Mon 16-Mar-92        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Changed message file handling to only open on demand.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.41 Fri 03-Apr-92        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Fixed a bug in PutBytes that resulted in "Not a heap block" errors and
     machine traps.  The code was not restoring the pointer to the internal
     buffer after it used the buffer in the PutBytes block if there was an
     error.  Bugs RP-1571 and RP-1677.

  *  Put code in to read the packet size from the transport system and to
     use this as the large buffer size.  See 5.32 and 5.36 for more details.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.42 Tue 07-Apr-92        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Fixed a bug in SaveFile introduced by the new record marking scheme
     (where each FCB record is marked with a UID and it is checked for every
     time it is looked up).

  *  Fixed a bug in PutBytes introduced by new faster code.

  *  Internationalised the new error for FCB UID marking.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.43 Fri 24-Apr-92        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Changed service entry to ignore errors and never corrupt registers.  It
     now doesn't accept Service_Reset at all.  Bug RP-2254.

  *  Increased the delay between retries in broadcasts, Count/Delay now 5/5.

  *  Separated out the OS 2.00 and OS 3.00 switches from those to do with
     using MessageTrans and ResourceFS, to help make a 2.00 version that
     does use MessageTrans (for A.U.N.).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Released in ROM as RISC OS 3.10

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.44 Fri 16-Jul-93        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Fixed name validation bug in SetPSName and BindPSName, this caused
     !Printers to give address exceptions.

  *  Moved to new source tree.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.45 Fri 24-Jun-94        Aideen McConville             

  *  No longer Gets EcoMacros.

  *  Needs HdrSrc - 3.52 or later.

  *  Command help/syntax now looked up in Global.Messages file.
  *  Help for *Configure PS now looked up in NetPrint.Messages file.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.47 Fri 28-Oct-94        Steve Cormie                  

  *  Added directed comments to Messages file for message tokenisation.
  *  Moved command help/syntax from Global.Messages to Messages file.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.48 Fri 02-Dec-94        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Replaced call to uppercase macro by explicit code.

  *  Removed R7 from Push in function LookupName.

  *  Folded in changes made by Owen Smith of SJ Research for their new
     extensions to the printing protocols.  The version number in brackets
     at the begining of each change shows the SJ version of NetPrint inwhich
     the changes were made.

  *  (5.45) Modified connect protocol to negotiate a features byte and use
     reply port &D0 if possible. This is necessary to allow an Archimedes
     to run a backgrounded printer server (eg. the SJ Research servers)
     and print to another (or the same) printer server. This was not
     possible previously because the data and the reply packets were
     both sent on port &D1 and so got confused.

  *  (5.45) Changed WaitForReception to check for Escape key.

  *  (5.46) Changed to send a partial packet if it is more than a minute
     since we got the acknowledge for the previous packet from the server.
     This is to alleviate problems with servers timing out if the dot
     matrix printer drivers spend a long time trickling half a page of
     carriage returns into our buffer.

  *  (5.47) Bug fix - set the X bit on Econet_PacketSize. The absence of
     this caused a serious problem on RISC OS 2 hardware Econet where the
     SWI does not exist, so the application's error handler was called
     while the printer drivers were active. Bug believed to have been
     introduced in version 5.41.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.53 Mon 20-Feb-95        Steve Cormie                  

Changes from Owen Smith (SJ-Research):

  * Fixed bug with *Configure PS reporting a syntax error on RISC OS 3.1
    version. It was doing a MessageTrans_Lookup of an explicit string.
    Fix implemented in HelpTexts file.

  * Integrated SJ changes since 5.47 back into Acorn 5.48 source tree.
    SJ code since 5.47 has been based on the SJ 5.47 source tree, which
    was itself based on the RISC OS 3.1 NetPrint 5.44 Acorn source tree.
    NetPrint 5.52 represents the first point at which SJ code is based on
    a RISC OS Black style source tree and thus the Acorn and SJ sources
    are identical. The version number in brackets at the begining of each
    change shows the SJ version of NetPrint in which the changes were made.

  * (5.49) Bug fix - added claiming of port &D0 since NetPrint listens on
    it.

  * (5.49) Bug fix - ignore jobstart reply packets with the wrong mode bits
    on new reply port. This stops print jobs starting using 76 byte packets
    due to picking up a duplicate acknowledge from a previous job on the
    jobstart rxcb. This is not done for the old reply port (as used by
    !Spooler, MDFS etc.) to gaurantee backwards compatibility.

  * (5.49) Enhancement - use a dynamic port for sending the print data if
    the server gives one. This prevents mis-delivery of packets at the
    server end due to gross over-use of port &D1.

  * (5.50) Bug fix for 5.49 - do machine type peek on opening connection
    and don't try for features byte to old hardware (eg. SJ Research MDFS).

  * (5.50) Bug fix - since 5.45 all the new connection negotiation code has
    had error handling which didn't remove the record from the list of
    handles etc. This is now fixed although the errors never happen in
    practice.

  * (5.50) Enhancement - if the new reply port is in use then ignore
    duplicate acknowledge packets and repost. This gets duplicates out of
    the system sooner (which is more efficient) and stops the jobstart
    duplicate code from having to throw away twenty to thirty duplicate
    acks. This is not done for the old reply port (as used by !Spooler,
    MDFS etc.) to gaurantee backwards compatibility.

  * (5.51) Bug fix for 5.50 - don't do machine type peek to local machine
    since hardware Econet does not support local loopback for immediate
    operations.

  * (5.51) Removed InstanceTxBuffer from job record since it is now unused.

  * (5.51) Changed name sorting to regard accents as significant as
    specified in the protocol document.

My changes:

  * Allocated an error number for ErrorNetOldServer (in Hdr:NewErrors) and
    changed code to use it.
