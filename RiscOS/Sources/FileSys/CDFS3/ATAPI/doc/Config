Drive configuration
-------------------

During initialisation, the module looks at the IDE bus to see what drives, if
any, are present. If an ATAPI device is found, configuration information has
to be set; this is the algorithm used:

  1)  Issue the ATAPI Identify Drive command (ATA command &A1) to determine:

        - CMDDRQType
        - Model Id  (40 chars)
        - Firmware Rev (18 chars)

      The CMDDRQType is needed before issuing any ATAPI Packet Command,
      because it determines some aspects of the protocol to be used.

  2)  If there is a configuration file for the device, read further
      configuration data from it, and go to step (4).

      The configuration file is identified by the Model Id returned in step
      (1), and may contain separate sections each identified by the Firmware
      Rev returned at the same time.

  3)  If there is no configuration file for the device, use the MODE SENSE
      command to read the Capabilities Mode Page, and set the "supported"
      flags from appropriate flags in this page.

  4)  Issue the INQUIRY command to determine the true identity of the device:

        - Vendor  (8 chars)
        - Product Id (16 chars)
        - Product Rev (4 chars)

      This information is used to set the 'model' and 'firmware' fields in
      the DriveRec as follows:

         model = Vendor + Product Id
         firmware = Product Rev
