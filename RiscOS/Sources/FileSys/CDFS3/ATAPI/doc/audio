Behaviour of audio operations on the Sony CDU76E
------------------------------------------------

The following behaviour is postulated from experiment!


1) The drive maintains an upper limit MAX for all audio operations.
   After reset, MAX = disc size.
   After issuing a PLAY command, MAX = the end address given in the command.

2) Any SCAN operation must specify a starting address < MAX; if not, the
   SCAN command is deemed to have completed immediately (and so has no effect
   other than to terminate any current audio operation).

3) Once started, a SCAN will terminate when sector MAX is reached (going
   forwards) or when sector 0 is reached (going backwards). [so there is no
   corresponding limit MIN.] 

4) When a PLAY or SCAN operation is PAUSEd, RESUME causes PLAY (*never* SCAN)
   to continue from the current position to MAX.

5) When a PLAY operation is STOPped, the audio operation is terminated.

6) When a SCAN operation is STOPped, the drive resumes audio play from the
   current position.

7) When an attempt is made to scan from a position > MAX while a PLAY
   operation is in progress, the drive becomes confused: the software thinks
   that the drive has stopped playing, but it has not. [This sounds like a
   bug in the drive's firmware].

8) When a PLAY operation is PAUSEd, STOP terminates the audio operation.

9) When a SCAN operation is PAUSEd, STOP sets the drive into a state such
   that the next command issued to it will time out: the drive then has to be
   reset before further commands can be sent. [This sounds like a bug in the
   drive's firmware].


Here's a possible state transition description:


STATE DORMANT:

  Command            Action                           Next state

  PAUSE  )
  RESUME )           Error "Play operation aborted"   DORMANT
  STOP   )
  PLAY TO x          MAX = x; starts audio play       PLAYING
  SCAN from y > MAX                                   DORMANT
  SCAN from y < MAX  Starts audio scan                SCANNING


STATE PLAYING:

  RESUME             None                             PLAYING
  STOP         )     Audio operation terminated       DORMANT
  Reaches MAX  )
  PLAY TO x          MAX = x; starts audio play       PLAYING
  SCAN from y > MAX                                   CONFUSED
  SCAN from y < MAX  Starts audio scan                SCANNING


STATE SCANNING:

  Command            Action                           Next state

  PAUSE              Drive pauses                     SCANPAUSED
  RESUME             None                             SCANNING
  STOP               Starts audio play                PLAYING
  Reaches MAX or 0   Audio operation terminated       DORMANT
  PLAY TO x          MAX = x; starts audio play       PLAYING
  SCAN from y > MAX                                   DORMANT
  SCAN from y < MAX  Starts audio scan                SCANNING


STATE PLAYPAUSED:

  Command            Action                           Next state

  PAUSE              None                             PLAYPAUSED
  RESUME             Restarts audio play              PLAYING
  STOP               Audio operation terminated       DORMANT
  PLAY TO x          MAX = x; starts audio play       PLAYING
  SCAN from y > MAX                                   DORMANT
  SCAN from y < MAX  Starts audio scan                SCANNING


STATE SCANPAUSED:

  Command            Action                           Next state

  PAUSE              None                             SCANPAUSED
  RESUME             Restarts audio play              PLAYING
  STOP               Audio operation terminated       SCREWEDUP
  PLAY TO x          MAX = x; starts audio play       PLAYING
  SCAN from y > MAX                                   DORMANT
  SCAN from y < MAX  Starts audio scan                SCANNING


STATE CONFUSED:

  The drive continues to play, but the audio status returned by READ
  SUB-CHANNEL indicates that no audio operation is in progress: PAUSE,
  RESUME and STOP all give error "Play operation aborted" despite the fact
  that the drive is still playing.


STATE SCREWEDUP:

  Drive will not accept commands: the BSY bit does not clear; a SOFT RESET
  command is necessary before further operations.
