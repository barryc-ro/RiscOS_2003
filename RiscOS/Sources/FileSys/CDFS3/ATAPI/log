Log file of changes to the ATAPI module

30-Jan-96  Coding started.

21-Feb-96  First version saved to source tree for safety, with following
           features implemented:
              - device identification
              - packet commands
              - error translation
              - registration
              - CDMgr test bed
              - two reason codes

27-Feb-96  Version 0.01  
           First release to Tim; includes conditional code for CDU50E, since
           we have only one CDU76E between us.

28-Feb-96  Add CDU50E conditional code to translate error with SK = 0,
            ASC = 0 and ASCQ = 0 to "Drive empty"; it seems that that drive
            returns that error if it is opened whilst a data transfer is in
            progress.

           Code added to defer "Disc changed" errors until the drive is
            ready (see atapi_disc_changed (..)).

           Version 0.02 released.

08-Mar-96  Bug fix: atapi_lock_bus (..) no longer gives up after the first
            attempt.

           Version 0.03 released.

11-Mar-96  Read2048 now uses READ (12) instead of READ (10), so that there is
            no longer a limitation of 65535 sectors for a transfer.

12-Mar-96  Recompiled with version 0.10 of commonlib.
           Bug fix: ReadTOC no longer translates disc type field as if it
            were in BCD.

           Version 0.04 released.

13-Mar-96  Treatment of deferred disc changes altered to allow commands which
            don't care about empty drives to go ahead (eg SET CD SPEED).

14-Mar-96  Issues dummy READ (12) after every "Disc changed" error; this hack
            seems to ensure that the "disc changed" mechanism inside the
            drive is re-triggered!

15-Mar-96  Tidy up disc change treatment, including an initial dummy READ
            during initialisation.

18-Mar-96  Save interim version to SrcFiler tree.

19-Mar-96  Version 0.05 released.
