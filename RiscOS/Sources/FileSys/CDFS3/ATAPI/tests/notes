Notes on testing:

1)  02-Feb-96

The veneer code in CDMgr for calling driver entry points has been tested -
both for a C Driver and an Assembler Driver.

For a C driver:

  - parameters arrived as specified
  - result was returned as specified
  - driver could access statics correctly
  - CDManager could access statics correctly after the call
  - CDManager's locals were unaffected by the call

For an Assembler driver:

  - parameters arrived as specified
  - result was returned as specified
  - CDManager could access statics correctly after the call
  - CDManager's locals were unaffected by the call
  - driver could write over regs R1-R12 and R14 without harm
