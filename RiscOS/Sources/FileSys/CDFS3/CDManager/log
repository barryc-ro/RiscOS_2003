Log file of changes to the CDManager module

22-Feb-96  Coding started, based on the CDManager module developed for
            testing the ATAPI module.

23-Feb-96  Debug tracing for all entry points in place; a few SWIs/reason
            codes implemented. Safety copy put into source tree.

27-Feb-96  Version 0.01
           First release for Tim; supports:
             CDMgr_Supported
             CDMgr_ReadTOC
             CDMgr_DriveOp:
               GetSequenceNumber
               DriveStatus
               BusyTimeOut
               EnumerateDrives
             CDMgr_ReadData
             CDMgr_MiscOp:
               GiveSectorDataMode
               WhichDisc
             CDMgr_CallDeviceDriver

28-Feb-96  Ensure CDMgr_ReadTOC always re-reads TOC from the drive - even to
            get the size/ check the parameters. This is because the Sony
            CDU76E drive does not notice disc changes if only this command
            is given.

           Version 0.02 released.

           Added code for:
             CDMgr_Version
             CDMgr_DriveOp:
               GetPhysicalLocation
07-Mar-96      GetDriveSpeed
               SetDriveSpeed
               GetVolume
               SetVolume
               OpenDrawer
               CloseDrawer
               GetLockedStatus
               LockDrive
               UnlockDrive
             CDMgr_AudioOp:
               PlayFromAddress
               Stop
               Pause
               Resume
               AudioScanForward

           Version 0.04 released.

15-Mar-96  Reenable TOC size cacheing (removed in version 0.02) now that the
            driver notices all disc changes (touch wood!).

18-Mar-96  Save interim version to SrcFiler tree.
           Reorganise header files.

19-Mar-96  CDMgr_Registration now returns correct version number (from module
            header rather than #define).
           Text for command output is now located in the Messages file.

           Version 0.05 released.

20-Mar-96  Renamed functions in c.swicode from atapi_... to swicode_...
           Bug fixes:
            EnumerateDrives now returns the correct maximum logical
             drive number even if there are "gaps".
            WhichDisc frees the TOC buffer.

           Version 0.06 released.
