The code to handle DriveRec's now maintains a list of the registered drives.
I tested this by modifying the ATAPI driver to issue random register and
derregister requests in response to the PollDrives service call, and then
checked that the appropriate devices were registered to the appropriate
logical drive numbers using *cddevices.

This also provided an opportunity to check that *cdunlock worked correctly
when presented with a number of drives some of which returned errors in
response to unlock.
