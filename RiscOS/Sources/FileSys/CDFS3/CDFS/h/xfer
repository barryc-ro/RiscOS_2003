/* This routine fetches blocks of data from the disc.
 *
 * on entry:
 *    disc_info is the usual updatable pointer to a disc information block pointer
 *    disc_addr is the logical block address of the file's start
 *    offset    is the offset into that file
 *    size      is the amount to be copied
 *    address   is the place to put the data
 *
 * on exit:
 *    the data has been copied in or else an error has been returned
 *
 * This routine does not need any of the above values to be sector aligned. It will
 * do an optimal job on those that are, however.
