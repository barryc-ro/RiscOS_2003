FileSwitch Veneers

Timothy Roddis

Because of the relative complexity of the veneer structure, some space ought
to be given to the discussion of how it works.

   s.FSVeneer contains the assembler to handle the actual FileSwitch entry
points.

   s.cdmacros contains a macro that can interface to (pseudo) APCS functions
with one peculiar property: parameters are returned in both r0 (error block or
NULL) and r1 (parameter block pointer or NULL). This is acheived by declaring
the C functions with the __value_in_regs function specifier, which allows
structures to be returned in registers.

   h.cdfs contains the typedef for the 'structure' returned, as well as a
define to stick before each function to indicate that it is an entry point
function.

The parameters are passed back in a static block. Whilst this is not ideal,
it is safe, because the registers are immediately loaded with their values by
the assebmler veneer. This should mean that there isn't a reentrancy problem.
   A better method might be to have the veneer reserve space on its stack
frame for the return parameters.
