The following files contain the following parts of the CDFS system:

debug allow

a  aux       - auxiliary routines
c  cache     - large memory allocation, buffer and cache handling for
              directory sectors, disc information records etc.
d  cdfs      - module and fs entry points
l  cdmgr     - low-level calls to CD Manager, thinish veneers (temporary)
g  command   - command handling entry point
e  direc     - ISO 9660 directory-level filing system specifics
z  disc      - disc access with abnormal status handling
f  filesys   - ISO 9660 disc-level filing system specifics
n  fname     - ISO 9660 -> RISC OS file name conversion routines
   globals.c - where the globals tentatively declared in main.h are finally
              fully declared, and initialised if necessary
s  swi       - swi handling
x  xfer      - data transfer function


NB: I've used numbers immediately after letters sometimes to indicate a further
level of detail (ie. really serious debugging). For example, adding a '1'
after 'e' for instance causes alsorts to be printed out. To add another
number as well the e must be included again, eg. 'e1e2'.

M memory
E msgs (error)
