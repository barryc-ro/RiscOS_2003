  0.03  04-Dec-95       When an ambiguous disc is discovered, the old one
                         is always dismounted automatically.
                        Disc records are created for any new discs
                         encountered during a search.
                        A disc is no longer rejected simply because its
                         discid does not match the one we are searching
                         for, and so read_discid (..) and read_pvd (..)
                         are combined.
                        (The above changes allow common algorithms to be
                         used for find_new_disc (..) and find_old_disc (..),
                         and simplify the algorithms considerably.)
                        New "top-level" function read_data_from_disc (..)
                         added.
  0.04  09-Jan-96       Flow chart for find_old_disc(..) corrected.
  0.05  11-Jan-96  TGR  All changed to reflect the naming and organisation
                         of the actual implementation.
  0.06  18-Jan-96  TGR  Changed filesys_retrieve_disc_info_for_drive
                         and diagram to reflect that it shoudl enumerate
                         drives.

1  Standard errors

The following errors can be returned from a driver:

  NODISC           Medium not present
  NEWDISC          Medium may have changed
  BUSY             Drive becoming ready
  ASLEEP           Drive not responding

In addition, CDManager may return:

  UNKNOWN          Drive not known


2  How GetSequenceNumber works

The CDManager SWI CDMgr_DriveOp GetSequenceNumber behaves as follows:

  seq = get_sequence_number (drivenum)

    The sequence number associated with the current state of the drive is
    returned. Note that NEWDISC is not a possible response, since the caller
    is interested only in the *current* state of the drive.

    Possible errors:

      NODISC
      BUSY
      ASLEEP
      UNKNOWN

    Algorithm:

      If the drive is not registered, return error UNKNOWN.

      Call "TEST UNIT READY" driver entry*; this can return OK, or any one
      of the four driver errors.

      switch (result)
      {
          case NODISC:
          case BUSY:
          case ASLEEP:
              return error;

          case NEWDISC:
              seq++;
          case OK:
              return seq;
      }

          * This is a new driver entry which needs to be added to the
             CDManager specification.


3  Locating a disc

There are three situations where CDFS needs to discover what disc is in a
drive:

      canonicalisation of a drive number
      locating an unknown disc
      locating a known disc

Specifications for these functions follow; flow diagrams for their
implementation are attached.


3.1  Canonicalisation: filesys_retrieve_disc_info_for_drive (..)

This function is called from the "canonicalise" routine to canonicalise a
drive number, and also from *dismount/*mount code when a drive number is
specified instead of a disc name.

  discrec = retrieve_disc_in_drive (drivenum)

    On entry:

    On exit:

      The disc record discrec describes the disc which is on the given drive.

    Possible errors:

      NODISC
      ASLEEP
      UNKNOWN
      No filing system on disc
      Files open on too many discs

    Notes on overall strategy:

      Waits for a while if the drive is BUSY.

      If the drive is not known, then enumerates the drives and tries again
      (if necessary).

      Marks any disc record which refers to this drive but is now out-of-date
      as "not in drive".

      Checks for an "ambiguous disc": if the disc in the drive has the same
      name as a different disc which is already known about, the old disc is
      dismounted.


3.2  Locating a disc: find_disc (..)

This function is called  when CDFS is given a pathname to process (other than
canonicalisation) and when a disc that has been seen before is asked for, but
this disc may no longer be in the drive.

   eg    FSEntry_Open (":Mike1.$.fred", ...)
         CDFS_LocateFile (":Jim.$.birds")
         *mount George

  discrec = filesys_find_disc (discname, ignorethisdrive)

    On entry:

       There may or may not be a disc record describing this disc.
       ignorethisdrive is set to -1 if all drives are to be checked for this
       disc.

    On exit:

      The disc record discrec describes the given disc, which is now
      available on one of the drives. Note that this record may not be
      the same one that was previously associated with this disc.

    Possible errors:

      Disc not found
      Files open on too many discs

    Notes on overall strategy:

      Uses OS_UpCall to encourage the user to insert the disc if it is not
      found on the first scan: scans are repeated at regular intervals to see
      if the disc has arrived.

      Waits for a while if any drive is found to be BUSY.

      Marks any disc record which refers to a drive but is now out-of-date as
      "not in drive".

      If a disc is found with the same name as the one requested but with a
      different discid, it replaces the previous one (which is dismounted).

      Creates disc records for any other new discs encountered during the
      search*.

        * This is important: if unknown discs are simply ignored, they will
           be accessed every time a search is made.


3.3 Reading information about a disc: read_disc_info (..)

  discrec = read_disc_info (drivenum, seq)

    On exit:

      Returns a record containing interesting information gleaned from the
      TOC and PVD in one of the cached disc records. This includes:

         - the disc type
         - the discid
         - the discname

    Possible errors:

      NODISC
      NEWDISC
      BUSY
      ASLEEP
      No filing system on disc
      Files open on too many discs

    Notes:

      This function first reads the TOC to see whether the disc contains any
      data tracks. If not, the error "No filing system on disc" is returned
      without further ado. This is important as a way of rejecting audio
      discs rapidly without disturbing them if they are playing.

      Checks for an "ambiguous disc": if the disc in the drive has the same
      name as a different disc which is already known about, the old disc is
      dismounted.

      The disc record that it returns is one of a static allocation of
      sector buffers which has either been used for this disc before or
      else was not in use.

      There is no guarantee that this will return the same disc record
      for a given disc. A side effect of a change in location is that
      all cached directory information for that disc will be 'lost'.


3.4 Cacheing information about a disc: cache_cache_disc_info (..)

  discrec = cache_cache_disc_info (discname, drivenum, seq, disctype
                                   rootdiraddr, rootdirsize, discid)

    On entry:

      All the information that is required in the disc information record
      is passed in as parameters. rootdiraddr and roodirsize are the 
      location and size of the root ('$') directory.

    On exit:

      The disc record that it returns is one of a static allocation of
      sector buffers which has either been used for this disc before or
      else was not in use.

    Possible errors:

      Files open on too many discs

    Notes:

      Checks for an "ambiguous disc": if the disc in the drive has the same
      name as a different disc which is already known about, the old disc is
      dismounted.

      Choose a disc record that is marked "not in use", if possible.
 
      Otherwise, choose one that is marked "not in drive" and which has no
      files open on it, or special directories*. Call forget_disc (discrec)
      to dismount the disc.
 
      Note that there are always more disc records than drives, and that
      open files on absent discs are unusual, so it is unlikely that this
      strategy will fail to find a disc record to reuse.
 
      Mark the chosen disc record as "in use" and copy in the new values.
 
       * Ideally, the record chosen for reuse should be the one that has
         been marked "not in drive" the longest. One way to achieve this is
         to store an increasing epoch number in a disc record whenever it
         is marked in this way, and then select the record with smallest
         number:
 
             /* mark record as "not in drive" */
             discrec->drivevalid = FALSE;
             discrec->epoch = epoch;
             epoch++;

      There is no guarantee that this will return the same disc record
      for a given disc. A side effect of a change in location is that
      all cached directory information for that disc will be 'lost'.



4  Reading data from a disc

Once a disc has been located, CDFS may later be requested to read data from
it in order to locate a file (by reading directory blocks) or to read data
sectors from an opened file.

The routine described here is prepared to find that the disc is no longer
available in the drive where it was originally located, and will search for
it.

CDFS always uses this read routine for the *first* read when entered from
FileSwitch, and, unless inconvenient or inefficient, should use it for
subsequent reads also - just in case. However, CDFS should be careful not to
call this routine a second time if an error is returned: this might result
in an endless loop.

  discrec = filesys_read_sectors (discrec, buff, sectornum, numsectors)

    On entry:

      discrec addresses a disc record which describes the disc from which we
      wish to read data.

      We wish to read 'numsectors' physical sectors of data starting at
      sector 'sectornum' into the buffer addressed by 'buff'.

    On exit:

      The data has been read into the buffer.

      discrec addresses a disc record describing the disc; this may not be
      the same record that was supplied on entry.

    Possible errors:

      Disc not available
      Sector not found

    Notes on overall strategy:

      If the disc record is marked as "not in drive", or if the first attempt
      to read data from the drive fails, find_old_disc (..) is called to
      locate the disc.

      If this call returns an error, or if the subsequent attempt to read
      data from the drive fails, an error is returned.


5  Ambiguous discs

Only disc_in_drive (..) or find_old_disc (..) can cause an ambiguous
situation to arise: by definition, find_new_disc (..) is looking for a disc
whose name is different from any already recorded.

If disc_in_drive (..) discovers that the disc in the drive has the same name
as but differs from another known disc, then the other disc is forcibly
dismounted. This means that:

  - any files open on the old disc are closed
  - any filer windows open on the old disc are closed
  - the disc is "forgotten"

This is likely to be what the user wants, since drive number canonicalisation
usually arises as a result of clicking on the drive icon, and clearly at that
moment the user wants to see what is on the *new* disc, not the old one.

For consistency, the same action is taken if find_old_disc (..) comes across
an ambiguous disc, although it is not so obvious that this will always please
the user.

These rules mean that the error "Ambiguous disc" will never arise as a
consequence of examining the discs on drives - but see below for a genuine
use for this message.


6  Disc names with wildcards

ADFS supports canonicalisation of wild-carded disc names.

For example, suppose that ADFS has seen just two discs, Mike1 and Fred2;
then:

  *cat :M*.$           - will list the root directory of Mike1
  *cat :####2          - will list the root directory of Fred2

But if ADFS also knows about Margaret, *cat :M*.$ returns "Ambiguous disc
name" - and, under some circumstances, will ask the user to please insert
disc 'M*'.

I propose that CDFS canonicalises disc names with wild cards as follows:

  discrec = resolve_wild_card_disc_name (discname)

    On entry:

      discname is a disc name which may include wild card characters:

        *  -  stands for zero or more characters
        #  -  stands for exactly one character

    On exit:

      discrec addresses the unique disc record which describes a disc whose
      name matches the given wild-carded name.

    Possible errors:

      No match for disc name
      Multiple matches for wild-carded disc name

    Algorithm:

      A search of all disc records is made (ie all "known" discs are
      considered), and name matches are counted:

        If exactly one match is found, this is returned as result.
        If no match is found, return "no match" error.
        If more than one match is found, return "multiple matches" error.

      Note that the user is never asked to supply a disc if a suitable one
      cannot be found.


7  Flow diagrams and support functions

The "call tree" for the top-level functions defined above in sections 3 and 4
is shown in DrawFile "calltree", and flow diagrams for the referenced
functions in the following DrawFiles:

    readdata  -  filesys_read_sectors (..)
    find      -  find_disc (..)
    scan      -  scan_for_disc (..)
    drive1    -  filesys_retrieve_disc_info_for_drive (..),
                 read_disc_info (..)
    drive2    -  cache_cache_disc_info (..)

The support functions referenced from the flow diagrams are described below.
Each of these functions expects the drive to contain a disc and to have the
given sequence number, so should only be called once the disc has been
successfully located. However, it is of course possible (but unlikely) that
the drive's state will have changed between validation and call, so error
returns such as NODISC are still possible.


7.2  Dismounting a disc

  cache_dismount_disc (discrec)

    This function dismounts the specified disc, and marks the disc record as
    available for re-use.

    On entry:

      The specified disc record is in use, and describes a disc which may or
      may not be in a drive.

    On exit:

      The disc record is available for reuse.

    Algorithm:

      Close any files which are open on the disc (by calling OS_Find 0).

      Unset any special directories (@, %, &, \) which identify directories
      on the disc (by calling OS_FSControl 53/54).

      Mark any directory sector cache blocks relating to the disc as invalid.

      Mark the disc record as "not in use".


7.4  Reading data from a disc

  read_data (drivenum, seq, buff, sectornum, numsectors)

    This function reads data from a CD-ROM.

    On entry:

      sectornum    -  physical sector address
      buff         -  address of buffer for transferred data
      numsectors   -  number of physical sectors to transfer

    Possible errors:

      NODISC
      NEWDISC
      BUSY
      ASLEEP
      NOTKNOWN
      Sector not found


7.5  Enumerate drives

  maxdrive = enumerate_drives ()

    This functions calls CDMgr_DriveOp EnumerateDrives, and returns the
    maximum drive number of which CDMgr is aware.


8  UpCalls

Filing Systems are expected to call OS_UpCall 1/2 whenever a requested disc
is not present; this gives an application the opportunity to request the user
to insert the missing disc into a drive.

The sequence of events is as follows:

   FS fails to find a disc, and calls, say, OS_UpCall 1.

   The Wimp (or CLI) responds by displaying a request for the user to insert
   the disc.

   The user clicks OK after inserting the disc, or clicks Cancel if he does
   not wish to proceed.

   The Wimp returns "OK" (R0 = 0) or "Cancel" (R0 = -1) as the result of the
   upcall.

   If "Cancel", the FS calls OS_UpCall 4 and then returns the error "Disc not
   found" to its client.

   If "OK", the FS searches for the desired disc once more:

     If the disc is found, the FS calls OS_UpCall 4 and then proceeds as
     normal.

     If the disc is not found, the FS calls OS_UpCall 1 again.

 Notes:

   The call OS_UpCall 4 is made to inform the Wimp that the search for the
   disc is over, and so the dialogue box can be removed from the screen.

   The first call of OS_UpCall 1 is made with R4 = 0, and subsequent calls
   within the same interaction have increasing values in R4. This is called
   the iteration count, and is used by the Wimp to decide whether to display
   a dialogue box or not (since one has already been displayed).

   One of the parameters of OS_UpCall 1 is a timeout value, which determines
   the maximum amount of time which can pass before the Wimp returns control
   to the FS - even if the user has not responded. This allows the FS to poll
   from time to time to see if the requested disc has been inserted, instead
   of having to wait for the user to click OK.

CDFS should issue up calls as follows:

  OS_UpCall 1/2

    On entry:

      R0  =   1                  (when called from find_old_disc (..))
              2                  (when called from find_new_disc (..))
      R1  =  37                  (the Filing System number)
      R2 ->  discname
      R3  =  -1                  (the drive number is not relevant)
      R4  =  iteration count     (0 for the first call per interaction)
      R5  =  10*                 (timeout period in centiseconds)
      R6 ->  "CD-ROM"            ('medium type' string)

         * this is the value which ADFS uses - CDFS may need to experiment

    On exit:

      R0  =  -1   =>   cancel the operation: the disc will not be supplied
              0   =>   call timed out, or user claims to have inserted disc

  OS_UpCall 4

    On entry:

      R0  =  4
