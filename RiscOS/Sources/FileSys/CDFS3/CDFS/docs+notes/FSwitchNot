   FileSwitch never hands CDFS special fields, but faults them itself.
   FileSwitch never checks the read-only filing system flag, so CDFS
must fault write operations.
   FileSwitch will not allow attempts to get data from a directory that has
been opened as a file, instead it fauls it with '<object> is a directory'.
