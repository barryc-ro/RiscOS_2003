Future Proofing:

   The xfer_get_blocks and direc_find_object, direc_find_object_at_offset
routines have some protection against the future. They are designed to cope
with up to 2^32 logical blocks per disc (2 terrabytes with 512 byte sized
logical blocks). There is code in specifically to avoid only being able to
address 4Gb.

   However (in main.h):
      * FS_MaxPathnameLength indicates the maximum length of filename that
        FileSwitch can cope with and should be increased if necessary.
      * ISO9660_PVD_VolumeIdentifierLength indicates the maximum disc name
        length and should be increased if necessary.
      * CDFS_MaxFileNameComponentLength indicates the maximum
        component length of a pathname.
