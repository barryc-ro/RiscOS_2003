IAC BABT Test User Guide
-----------------------------------

Introduction
----------------

The IAC contains software that is designed to enable the IAC to be tested to the requirements of BABT 340 levels 1 and 2 [1].

*** Note: Running this software does not guarantee that the IAC conforms to BABT340.  It is essential that a manufacture seeking approval contact BABT.  Full BABT 340 approval requires additional hardware testing which is beyond the scope of this document. ***

The BABT test software will perform the following tests:

1. Online test
    The modem goes off hook and the user is asked to confirm that the TestTel 100E
    online light goes on.

    reference : BABT 340 Table 3, No. 3. [2]

2. Offline test
     The modem goes on hook and the user is asked to confirm that the TestTel 100E
    online light goes off.

    reference : BABT 340 Table 3, No. 3.

3. Line Leakage Test
    The user is asked to press the button on the Line Leakage Detector and confirm
    that the light goes green.

    reference : BABT 340 Table 3, No. 1.

4. Pulse (loop-disconnect) Dial Test
Pulse dials 1234567890 to the TestTel 100E.  The user is asked to confirm that the TestTel 100E      displays the digits as dialled.  The test software then pulse dials 200 into the TestTel 100E.  This causes the TestTel to measure the make/break ratio.

    reference : BABT 340 Table 3, No.7.



5. Tone (DTMF) Dial Test
Tone dials 1234567890 to the TestTel 100E.  The user is asked to confirm that the TestTel 100E displays the digits as dialled.  The test software then tone dials 200 into the TestTel 100E.  This  causes the TestTel to display the tone dial on/off timings.

    reference : BABT 340 Table 3, No.8.

6. Signal Power Test
    The modem generates a tone so that the mean power level can be measured.
    The TestTel 100E does not have a calibrated scale, you must connect a suitable   
    meter to the break out sockets on the TestTel to perform these measurements.

    reference : BABT 340 Table 3, No. 11.
