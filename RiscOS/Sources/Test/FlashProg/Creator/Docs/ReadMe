reading.c/h is a (renamed) source code fragment from NCRmgr with a couple
of functions to read a ROM image file and perform a ROM image CRC check
on the pre and post compression image data. Currently, NCRmgr performs
the latter, reports the result, performs the former, reports that
result, and then reports the conclusion:

 * If both fail, it claims the image is damaged beyond repair
 * If both succeed, the image is fine
 * If one fails and one succeeds, it claims that the file's header may
   be damaged but the ROM data could be salvageable. It does not attempt
   any data recovery itself.

Note that the functions assume the data in the file is ZLib compressed.
If it isn't, ZLib will return an error, which will be reported via.
utils_make_zlib_error - this just takes an error number from zlib and
wraps an appropriate message around it ("Error code 'n' from ZLib"),
so it's something that's easy enough to write your own equivalent of.
There's a similar error generating function "make_no_memory_error"
which you will find in the attached code too, which is equally simple.

Currently, ROM image files with uncompressed image data are not
supported. I have no plans for supporting them at present, since they
cannot be generated MakeNCimg.

You'll need to include 'zlib/zlib.h' to gain access to the zlib
decompression and CRC check routines. ZLib can be found in the CVS
repository on the TRUNK at:
