UnitTest Help
--------------

Usage:

unittest <test mode> <test number> <extra options> <printer>

e.g. unittest single 65536 5 epson

<test mode> = 'single' for single cycle test or 'cont' for
continous test. 

<test number> is a decimal number which is converted into
a binary pattern.  Each bit represents a unique test as follows:


ROM             2^0   
DRAM            2^1   
NVRAM           2^2
SYSTEM          2^3
MODEM           2^4
AUDIO           2^5
SMART CARD      2^6
USER INPUT      2^7
LOGGED CODES    2^8
FLASH           2^9
SERIAL FLASH    2^10
LEDCHECK        2^11
IRREMOTE        2^12
MOUSE           2^13
TESTCARD        2^14
SERIAL          2^15
PRINTER         2^16
MPEG            2^17

RESULTTOSERVER  2^30 (special case)

so to run the ROM test and SYSTEM test, <test number> is 1+8 =9 so run:

		unittest 9
		
<extra options> are currently as follows:

RESULT TO SERVER     2^0
DEFAULT CMOS         2^1
RESULTS TO PRINTER   2^2

Not that DEFAULT CMOS will reset your CMOS setting so use with caution.


Two types of printer are currently supported.

<printer> = epson or HP

note that <printer> MUST be the third command line augument or it will
be interpreted as on of the other command line auguments.
