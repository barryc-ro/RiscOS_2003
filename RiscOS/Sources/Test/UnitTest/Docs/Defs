Within the unit test are certain definitions which should not be included in
this part build, but declared globally across the whole build.  These are
namely SWI number definitions.

Within UnitTest, these can be found in the following files:

  - h.DaytonaHW			all the DaytonaHW module SWI numbers
  - h.DiallerB			all the DiallerB module SWI numbers
  - c.FlashCheck		SWI number definition for AppFlash_Checksum

Once these have been removed, the following files will need to be altered
to include the new header files containing the SWI numbers:

  - c.Modem			needs DaytonaHW and DiallerB definitions
  - c.flashcheck		needs AppFlash_Checksum definition
