DRAM Test
---------

Number		Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
&10000000	the number of Incrementing pattern failures were spotted
&20000000	the number of Cyclic test failures were spotted
&30000000	the number of True Hirearcy test failures were spotted
&80000000	the number of False Hirearcy test failures were spotted
&08000001	the lower and upper memory limits wer identical
&08000002	the upper memory limit was less than the the upper memory
                limit
&08000003	the Dynamic Area failed to be created.
&08000004	the Dynamic area failed to be free-ed.


These are added to produce on error code, the msbyte, being a bit pattern
means that whicg sub test failed cab be spotted.
The memory test will have been terminated early if error codes :-
     &08xxxxx1, &08xxxxx2, and &08xxxxx3 are reported.
     &08xxxxx4 is a post test failure.

Code
P1&<xx>:&<yy>=/=&<zz>   Phase 1 Test failed at &xx with &<yy> instead of &<zz>
P2&<xx>:&<yy>=/=&<zz>   Phase 2 Test failed at &xx with &<yy> instead of &<zz>
P3/4&<xx>:&<yy>=/=&<zz> Phase 3 or 4 Test failed at &xx with &<yy> instead of &<zz>
