; Builds a version of the module which registers both PAL and NTSC files, but
; doesn't attempt to detect the hardware PAL/NTSC type itself.
;
; Detection of hardware type is delegated to another module (eg DENCDriver in
; STB-400). Whenever ModeFiles needs to know the monitor type, it reads it from
; the TV$Type variable.
;
; This build of the module has no service call handler; the actions which other
; builds of ModeFiles take on receipt of Service_MonitorLeadTranslation and
; Service_PostInit are assumed to be performed instead by the same module that
; detects hardware type.
