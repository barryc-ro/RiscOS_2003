;                                       based on pixel shape.
;                               Fixed module header because help/syntax moved to Global.
;                               Open menus are updated on mode/palette change (get ticks right).

; 04-Feb-94     0.26    SMC     Invalidate ColourTrans cache and force redraw whole screen if palette
;                                       has changed on Service_WimpPalette/Service_CalibrationChanged.
; 17-Feb-94     0.27    SMC     Leave items in colour menu shaded if not supported by any modes

; 29-May-97     0.34    KJB     Stopped responding to Service_MessageFileClosed. Responding to this
;                               allowed instant response to resource changes while actually running,
;                               but the code had the disadvantage that mode selections in progress
;                               were lost when this service call happens. Thanks to ShareFS, files
;                               pop in and out of ResourceFS a lot, causing a lot of service calls.
;                               Hence this behaviour was more of a hindrance than a help. Especially
;                               as territories are only normally loaded outside the desktop.
