/*
 * Initialisation code
 * ===================
 *
 * Return NULL if your initialisation succeeds; otherwise return a pointer
 * to an error block. cmd_tail points to the string of arguments with which
 * the module is invoked (may be "").
 * podule_base is 0 unless the code has been invoked from a podule.
 * pw is the 'R12' value established by module initialisation. You may
 * assume nothing about its value (in fact it points to some RMA space
 * claimed and used by the module veneers). All you may do is pass it back
 * for your module veneers via an intermediary such as SWI OS_CallEvery
 * (use _swix() to issue the SWI call).

/*
 * Finalisation code
 * =================
 *
 * Return NULL if your finalisation succeeds. Otherwise return a pointer to
 * an error block if your finalisation handler does not wish to die (e.g.
 * toolbox modules return a 'Task(s) active' error).
 * fatal, podule and pw are the values of R10, R11 and R12 (respectively)
 * on entry to the finalisation code.

/*
 * Generic veneers
 * ===============
 *
 * This is the name of the generic entry veneer compiled by CMHG.
 * Use this name as an argument to, for example, SWI OS_CallEvery
 * or OS_AddCallBack.
 *
 * These veneers ensure that your handlers preserve R0-R11
 * and the processor flags (unless you return an error pointer.
 * The veneer can be entered in either IRQ or SVC mode. R12 and
 * R14 are corrupted.

 * This is the handler function that the veneer declared above
 * calls.
 *
 * For a standard exit, return NULL. For handlers that can return an
 * error, return an error block pointer, and the veneer will set the
 * 'V' bit, and set R0 to the error pointer.
 *
 * 'r' points to a vector of words containing the values of R0-R9 on
 * entry to the veneer. If r is updated, the updated values will be
 * loaded into R0-R9 on return from the handler.
 *
 * pw is the private word pointer ('R12') value with which the
 * entry veneer is called.

/*
 * Vector handlers
 * ===============
 *
 * This is the name of the vector handler entry veneer
 * compiled by CMHG. Use this name as an argument to SWI
 * OS_Claim. (EventV claimants should use a CMHG event handler).
 *
 * Note that vector handlers were previously called IRQ handlers
 * and were documented as being for attaching to IrqV. IrqV has
 * long being deprecated; you should use OS_ClaimDeviceVector and
 * a CMHG generic veneer instead.

 *   Return 1 to pass on the call.
 * If you use a vector handler veneer for any other purpose, always
 * return non-0, and consider the use of a generic veneer instead.
 * It is not currently possible to return an error from a vector
 * handler.
 *
 * 'r' points to a vector of words containing the values of R0-R9 on
 * entry to the veneer. If r is updated, the updated values will be
 * loaded into R0-R9 on return from the handler.

 * pw is the private word pointer ('R12') value with which the
