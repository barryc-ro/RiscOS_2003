   This is a simple module containing a few functions to do useful thingd to
icons.

         |icon_ratio| is a function to do a commonly-occuring division.

         |icon_set_slider| sets a "slider," represented by two icons, to a
      given value. It is just an implmentation of the code in P R M p3-24,
      and it assumes that the icon handle will not change on deletion/
      recreation - in other words, there must be no deleted icons in the
      window.

         |icon_format_fixed| sets an icon to a numeric value. This code is
      from P R M p3-23.

         |icon_increment| adjusts the given icon by the specified amount
      within the given limits

         |icon_scan_dec| reads the numeric value of an icon (decimal
      integer).

         |icon_scan_fixed| does the same for a decimal fixed-point icon.
