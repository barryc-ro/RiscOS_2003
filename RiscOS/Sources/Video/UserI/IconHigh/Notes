Java may want control of whether windows are auto-scrolled by iconhigh.


Meeting on 06 Mar 1997, decided which keys to use.

Control			Handset		Keyboard	IRKeyboard
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Direction		cursor		cursor		cursor
Select,Menu		ok,menu		Return,Keypad+	return,menu
Toggle on/off		Stop		Scroll lock	Stop

No cycling through off/highlight/ballistic - only on/off is supported.

Will need to allow application to stop IconHigh from responding to
toggle key, as Stop button can be used by codecs etc. Probably best to
add a flag to word set by IconHigh_DefaultEmulation.

Still issue remaining of whether handset will use KeyV. At the moment,
it simply puts things into the keyboard buffer, but this is problematic
for Java and IconHigh. Steve C is talking to Tim D about this... For the
time being, handset won't use KeyV. So IconHigh will have to look in the
keyboard buffer.






Set bit 3 of r0, redraw_addcallback, to redraw on top of icons.


Note that Sources.Desk.WimpSWIs. contains new version of all Desk_Wimp_
veneers, which call the X SWI and then checks the V flag specifically,
rather than relying on SWI errors to raise a signal. This is because
this conversion to signals doesn't work in IconHigh - probably because
it is calling from SVC mode.

In the future, Desk's wimp swis will be updated to use the
explicit-check model.
