 Questions on MPEG 2 card
 ------------------------
 
 1) If you're not using the data FIFO should you/must you hold the data FIFO
in the reset state?

 2) Does the System/NOT Separate bit (bit 6 of Control2) just switch the FIFO
over from AREQ/AVALID (for System) to VREQ/VVALID (for Separate)?

 3) Is it safe to assert the FIFO reset at any point, to flush all the data
out, even if it's in the middle of a transfer to the L64002?

 4) Is it possible to use one of the reserved Control Register bits (eg bit 5
in Control Register 2) to conditionally tie the SINK signal to VIDC20 low,
instead of being connected to the sync generator. This would help me use the
board in my RISC PC, where I want to have both an AKF85 *and* a TV plugged
into it at the same time, and switch between them under software control.
