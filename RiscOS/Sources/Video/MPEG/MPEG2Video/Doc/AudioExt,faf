 <h2>Introduction</h2>
 The following extensions to the MPEG audio decoding system have been requested by customers:
 <ul>
 <li>Control over which channels of a dual mono audio stream are played;
 <li>Control over whether the audio mutes when errors are detected.
 </ul>
 This functionality is provided by means of the extensions to the MPEG API
described below. To use these extensions you need the following versions of
the MPEG modules (or later):
 <ol TYPE="a">
 <li><tt>MPEG2Video&nbsp;2.56 (09 Oct 1998)</tt>
 <li><tt>MPEGCtrl&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.44 (13 Oct 1998)</tt> (for system/program streams)
 <li><tt>MPEGTrans&nbsp;&nbsp;1.67 (15 Oct 1998)</tt> (for MPEG2 transport streams)
 </ol>
Only one of b) or c) can be loaded at any one time.

 <h2>Audio parameters structure</h2>
 This structure, a pointer to which is passed in r3 on entry to
MPEGControl_OpenStream, is extended as follows:
 <table border="1">
 <tr><th align="center">Offset<th align="left">Contents</th></tr>
 <tr><td align="center">0<td align="left">Audio structure format type (0 at
present)</td></tr>
 <tr><td align="center">4<td align="left">
   Audio flags word:
   <table border="0">
   <tr><th>Bit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       <th align="left">Meaning when set</th></tr>
   <tr><td>0<td>Mute audio on errors</td></tr>
   <tr><td>1<td>Use word at offset 8 as dual channel mode specifier</td></tr>
   </table>
   Other bits are reserved and should be set to zero.
   </td></tr>
 <tr><td align="center">8<td align="left">
   Dual channel mode specifier - this determines which channels are played when a dual mono audio stream is played:
   <table border="0">
   <tr><th align="left">Value&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<th align="left">Meaning</th></tr>
   <tr><td>0<td>Play left channel on left output, right channel on right output (default)</td></tr>
   <tr><td>1<td>Play left channel on both outputs</td></tr>
   <tr><td>2<td>Play right channel on both outputs</td></tr>
   </table>
   Other values are reserved and should not be used.
   </td></tr>
 </table>

 <pre>
 <h5>On entry</h5>
	r0 = reason code
	r1 = control stream handle
	Other registers as determined by reason code

 <h5>On exit</h5>
	Depends on reason code

 <h5>Use</h5>
	This call modifies various operating parameters of the audio
	decoder. The reason codes supported are as follows:

 <h5>Reason code 0 - Control audio muting on errors behaviour</h5>

 <h5>On entry</h5>
	r0 = reason code (0)
	r1 = control stream handle
	r2 = 0  => don't mute audio on errors
	     1  => mute audio on errors
	     -1 => read current state

 <h5>On exit</h5>
	r2 = old state

 <h5>Use</h5>
	This call can be used during the playing of a stream to modify the behaviour
	of the audio decoder when errors are encountered. This setting
	overrides any previous setting in the audio parameters structure.

 <h5>Reason code 1 - Control dual channel behaviour</h5>

 <h5>On entry</h5>
	r0 = reason code (1)
	r1 = control stream handle
	r2 = dual channel mode specifier (as above), or -1 to read
	      current state

 <h5>On exit</h5>
	r2 = old dual channel mode specifier
	r3 = type of stream currently playing:
              	0  => stereo
	  	1  => joint stereo
		2  => dual mono
		3  => mono
		-1 => unknown

 <h5>Use</h5>
	This call can be used during the playing of a stream to modify which
        channel(s) are played of a dual mono stream. The setting only takes
	effect if the stream being played is dual mono, and overrides any
	setting in the audio parameters structure. For information, the
	call also returns the type of stream being played. If -1 is returned
	in r3, this means that not enough audio data has been played yet to
	determine the type of stream.
