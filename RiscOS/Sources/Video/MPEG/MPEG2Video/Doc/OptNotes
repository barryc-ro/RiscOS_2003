MPEG2VIDEO COMPILE-TIME OPTIONS
-------------------------------

Module			- obsolete option, but set TRUE
international		- not implemented
Revision		- RevC in all released hardware
ShowPTS			- obsolete
SendPTS			- obsolete
SuppressNegativeSCRs	- obsolete
SuppressNegativePTSs	- obsolete
SendPlaySWI		- always set TRUE
SkippingCode		- obsolete / not implemented
EnableIRQsInTickerV	- always set TRUE
FastPoduleAccess	- always set FALSE
MultiplePicturePacketChecks - obsolete
FullLengthStats		- probably functional, printout code is in *VideoInfo
SkipByBlanking		- obsolete
CheckBufferFullness	- obsolete
UseWholePackets		- always set TRUE (need L64002 to parse PTSs)
VetSCRValues		- harmless sanity check, might as well leave in
AllowSyncOnIFrames	- for DEC servers; not v. successful; now obsolete
CountVideoPackets	- DEC; obsolete; superceded by trick play underrun fix
NYI			- unconverted MPEG-1 functionality, could be removed
DoPEH			- always set TRUE
ClearFrameBuffers	- clears frame buffer to *black*, always set TRUE
CountFieldInversions	- set this TRUE now we have pulldown
PerformFieldInversion	- deliberately inverts fields once, always set FALSE
ProgrammableBlanking	- blanked sequences/fields support, always set TRUE
CountUnderruns		- always set TRUE (video underrun code)
Save1stFullPacket	- copies first bitstream packet (up to 184 bytes)
			    and its PTS; debugging only
Save1stFIQPacket	- again, debugging only
PreserveIRQStateInTickerVStuffing - currently FALSE, Tim is unsure of the
			    consequences of setting it TRUE
HoldResetFor10ms	- this was a red herring, set it FALSE
RegDebug		- *Read/WriteL64002 and *PacketInfo commands
NobbleL64002VideoPacketLengths - not needed, set FALSE (can also be used in
			    conjunction with FudgeZeroLengthPackets)
FudgeZeroLengthPackets	- works out a length for zero length PES packets
			    unconditionally (ie not just on trick play etc)
TrickPlaySupport	- does the above for all trick play PES packets
			    if TrickPlayPacketLengthFix is set
			    (it assumes the original is incorrect);
			    also enables TrickPlayUnderrunFix support
UnderrunFixOnlyOnOddFields - always set TRUE, otherwise we get field inversion
FreezeFieldOnTrickStop	- always set TRUE
FudgeQSIF		- support for v. small movies, set TRUE
AudioSquawkFix1		- reconstructs PES headers in 8-byte multiples; TRUE
AudioDebug		- saves PES audio stream to buffer, from which it can
			    be saved using *SaveAudio; debug only
DiscardPartialPackets	- discards bitstream packets until MPEGStart bit is
			    set; always set TRUE
CheckAspectRatio	- aspect switching when sequence header changs; TRUE
InitL64002OnModuleInit	- currently FALSE; should it be?
AudioStats		- debugging info, may as well leave TRUE
BigAudioThresholds	- defaults to larger values; system variables will
			    break if this is FALSE; also includes the amount
			    of data queuing in the calculations, as well as
			    the amount in the channel buffer
SlowMotionSupport	- leave TRUE
SCARTCTRLRegistersAreInIOMD - allows emulation of older hardware in STB3
Captions		- closed caption extraction
Pulldown		- reads 3:2 pulldown flags from video stream and
			    controls L64002 pulldown state
