; Items printed by VideoInfo command

All values are printed in hexadecimal except where stated.

 Audio Sample rate:
   This shows the sample rate of the audio stream, or 'Unknown' if no audio
   header has been decoded yet. Printed in decimal.
  
 Sequence layer data:
   This is the data from the last video sequence header, in the format the
   L64002 stores it:
     horizontal_size	- 2 bytes (hi, lo)
     vertical_size	- 2 bytes
     pel_aspect_ratio   - 1 byte
     picture_rate	- 1 byte
     bitrate		- 3 bytes
     VBV buffer size	- 2 bytes
     Miscellaneous bits	- 1 byte

 Bad SCRs:
   Whenver an audio PTS is used to set the SCR (when the audio frame is
   presented), the code does a sanity check on it based on the STB's
   internal clock. If it is more than about 1/4 of a second out, then this
   count is incremented and the value is rejected, unless we have got two
   mutually consistent bad values, in which case it is assumed we have had
   a discontinuity, so the new value is used as the basis for subsequent
   sanity checks. Reset to zero on OpenStream and ResetStream.

 DRAM buffer holds contents of address
 ...which are:
   Internal diagnostic - monitors DRAM line cache for L64002 memory.

 AudioChannelBufferReadPtr:
   Internal diagnostic - monitors read pointer position in audio channel
   buffer.

 AudioPTSInCount:
   The number of audio PTSs received. Reset to zero on OpenStream.
 
 AudioFasts:
   The number of times the L64002 was told to play an audio frame fast (ie
   at 13/12 * normal speed) for the purposes of audio-to-stream
   synchronisation. Reset to zero on module initialisation and
   OpenStream.
 
 AudioSlows:
   The number of times the L64002 was told to play an audio frame slow (ie
   at 11/12 * normal speed) for the purposes of audio-to-stream
   synchronisation. Reset to zero on module initialisation and
   OpenStream.
 
 Video skips:
   The number of times the L64002 was told to skip the next B-picture.
   Reset to zero on OpenStream.
 
 Video repeats:
   The number of times the L64002 was told to repeat the next picture.
   Reset to zero on OpenStream.
 
 Number of video PTSs that came in:
   The number of video PTSs received.
   Reset to zero on OpenStream.

 Number of posted video PTSs:
   The number of video PTSs that have been posted for comparison with the
   SCR when the frame is presented. This is less than the total number of
   video PTSs because:
     a) it only posts PTSs that are attached to B-pictures;
     b) if it hasn't done the comparison for a previously posted PTS yet, it
        ignores the new one.
   Reset to zero on OpenStream.
 
 Number of I/P/B-pictures with PTS:
   The number of video PTSs on that particular picture type.
   Reset to zero on OpenStream.

 Most negative PTS-SCR:
   Two's complement number, being the most negative value of (PTS - SCR)
   encountered so far. Values which are less than 1 frame time out are
   not included in this count.
   Reset to zero on OpenStream.
 
 Most positive PTS-SCR:
   The most positive value of (PTS - SCR) encountered so far. Values which
   are less than 1 frame time out are not included in this count.
   Reset to zero on OpenStream.
 
 Trick stops:
   The number of times at the start of an odd field that the video decoder
   was put into pause mode (to prevent underruns) during OVS trick play mode.
   Reset to zero on OpenStream.
 
 Trick starts:
   The number of times at the start of an odd field that the video decoder
   was allowed to continue decoding during OVS trick play mode.
   Reset to zero on OpenStream.
 
 Horizontal size:
   Horizontal size of decoded picture, as determined from video
   sequence header.
   Reset to 352 (0x160) on OpenStream (and on module initialisation on
   versions of MPEG2Video from 2.57 onwards).
 
 Vertical size:
   Vertical size of decoded picture, as determined from video sequence
   header.
   Reset to 288 (0x120) on OpenStream (and on module initialisation on
   versions of MPEG2Video from 2.57 onwards).
 
 Horizontal display output size:
   The MPEG picture is horizontally scaled up by a programmable hardware 
   scaler in the L64002. This value shows the scaled-up size currently
   being used. It is normally either 704 (0x2C0) or 720 (0x2D0), whichever
   has the highest common factor with the decoded picture size, but in the
   case of SIF or smaller pictures, it uses 2 x the decoded picture size.
 
 Video VBV size:
   The VBV buffer size as determined from the video sequence header.
   Reset to 200K on OpenStream or ResetStream.
 
 Video prefilling:
   Set to 1 while pre-filling the video buffer, else 0.
 
 Audio prefilling:
   Set to 1 while pre-filling the audio buffer, else 0.
 
 Blanked sequences:
 Blanked fields:
   On OpenStream and ResetStream, the MPEG display is blanked until a
   programmable number of sequence headers has been decoded, followed by
   a programmable number of field times. These are the programmed numbers.
   The -blankseqs and -blankfields options in the player program set these
   values (they default to 1 and 16 respectively).
 
 First item received was:
   This indicates what syntactic item was decoded first by the video decoder
   out of (sequence header, picture header). If neither of these has been
   decoded yet, it reports 'nothing'.
 
 Video channel underruns:
   This is 1 if there have been any video channel underruns, 0 otherwise.
   Reset to zero on OpenStream.
 
 Next follow sections of information labelled '** Audio/video info **'. These
 are mainly internal diagnostics of the process of extracting PES packet header
 information from the L64002's buffers.

 System buffer underruns:
   This is the number of times an attempt is made to read the L64002's system
   buffer (ie where PES packet headers or MPEG-1 system stream packet headers
   get put) and there is insufficient data to complete reading of the header,
   because the L64002 is still in the process of DMAing the data to memory. It
   should not be interpreted as an error condition.

 Duff channel addresses:
   When the L64002 dumps a packet header into its system buffer, it tags it with
   the address in the video or audio channel buffer that corresponds to the byte
   after the packet header - this is needed for comparison with the position of
   picture start codes, to identify to which picture a PTS applies. This is the
   count of the number of times that this channel buffer address lies outside the
   range of addresses allocated to the channel buffer. It should normally be zero.
   
 Duff system buffer contents:
   This is the number of times when data is read from the audio/video system
   buffer and it does not conform to a valid PES packet header structure. It
   should normally be zero, but a count of one is frequently observed
   for the video system buffer (don't know why).

 Last duff contents address:
   This is the address within L64002 memory where the PES packet header
   structure became invalid (not much use since the contents of the buffer
   have long since been overwritten).

 SystemBufferStart:
 SystemBufferEnd:
   These are the addresses in L64002 memory of the start/end of the relevant
   system buffer.

 SystemBufferReadPtr:
 SystemBufferWritePtr:
   These are the addresses within the system buffer where the next data gets
   read from or written to respectively.

 PTSListReadPtr:
 PTSListWritePtr:
 PTS list overruns:
   When PTSs are removed from the L64002 system buffers, they are stored on a
   circular list in the STB's memory until they get matched up with video or
   audio frames getting presented. These variables are the indices into the
   buffer of the reading and writing positions and the number of times the
   list ran out of space respectively.
 
 Last ErrorStatus:
 Cumulative ErrorStatus:
   The L64002 ErrorStatus register contains the following bits:
     bit 7: SCR match (not an error)
     bit 6: SCR overflow (to indicate to the software to increment the high
            order bits - not an error)
     bit 5: Audio reconstruction error
     bit 4: Audio sync error
     bit 3: Audio CRC or illegal bit error
     bit 2: Video reconstruction error
     bit 1: Context error
     bit 0: Variable length code or run-length error

  The 'Last ErrorStatus' is the most recent reading of this register.
  The 'Cumulative ErrorStatus' is the logical OR of all readings since the
  last OpenStream or ResetStream.
 
 Video reconstruction errors:
   This is the number of times since the last OpenStream or ResetStream that
   the ErrorStatus was read and found to have bit 2 set.
  
 Context errors:
   This is the number of times since the last OpenStream or ResetStream that
   the ErrorStatus was read and found to have bit 1 set.
  
 VLC errors:
   This is the number of times since the last OpenStream or ResetStream that
   the ErrorStatus was read and found to have bit 0 set.
