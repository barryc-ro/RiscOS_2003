  Register a handler with the video unit

On entry
  R0 = handler number
       1       NTSC line 21 (odd field) data handler
       2       NTSC line 284 (even field) data handler
       others  not currently defined, should not be registered
  R1 = address of handler function
  R2 = workspace pointer for handler

On exit
  All registers preserved


Handler entry, general
  R0-R7 = parameters (dependent on handler number)
  R8 = handler number
  R12 = value from R2 when handler was registered
  R14 = return address
  Processor is in SVC mode

Handler exit
  R0-R7 are passed on to the next claimant (if any)
  R8 = 0 to claim the event
  R8 preserved to pass on the event to the next-most-recently-registered handler
  R12 and R14 may be corrupted
  Other registers must be preserved


Handler parameters, handler numbers 1 and 2
  R0 = flags word    \
  R1 = data pointer   |  as on entry to SWI Macrovision_LoadCaptions
  R2 = data length   /
  Interrupts are disabled

                                                                (SWI &4930C)

  Deregister a handler previously registered with MPEGVideo_RegisterHandler

On entry
  R0-R2 are the same as they were on registering the handler

On exit
  All registers preserved
