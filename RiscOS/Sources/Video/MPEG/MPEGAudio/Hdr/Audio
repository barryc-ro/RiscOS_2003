; Makes version of audio module for new hardware that has the audio IRQ fix,
; but doesn't have new ProdType field in the podule EPROM.  It doesn't have the
; workround for the revision TMXC pause bug, i.e. it assumes the AV110 fitted
; hasn't got the bug.

; When AudioIRQBodge is false, the code assumes new audio hardware is present,
; which latches the IRQ pulse from the AV110 and clears it on a write to EPROM
; space (and also on reads in the current implementation, which is not very
; good!)

; By setting HandleNoDRAM to true, make a version which copes with the case of
; a machine where the AV110's external DRAM is not fitted, and the MPEG
; interface hardware allows the latched AV110 interrupt to be wired up to
; PoduleFIQ instead of the normal podule IRQ line, by setting the FIQEnable bit
; in the control register.  (The older version turned the CL450's INT rather
; than the AV110's INT into PFIQ in this case, but we never use it that way).
; The software manages this by first checking with the AV110 as to whether or
; not it has external DRAM, using the existing behaviour if it has, and setting
; up FIQs etc to handle the low-latency data transfers if not.  N.B. Support
; for DRAM-less working is NOT an exclusive assembly-time option, i.e. the same
; module can still cope if DRAM is fitted.  This is done in order to preserve
; system configuration flexibility without software configuration pain.
