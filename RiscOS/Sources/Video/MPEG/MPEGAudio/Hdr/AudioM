; Makes version of audio module for CC/Wild Vision Movie Magic card.
; This has the audio fix and has the new ProdType field (&F9) in the
; podule EPROM.  It does not support DRAM-less working of the AV110, 
; since the Movie Magic card has the DRAM fitted anyway.

; When false, the code assumes new audio hardware is present, which latches the
; IRQ pulse from the AV110 and clears it on a write to EPROM space (and also
; on reads in the current implementation, which is not very good!)
