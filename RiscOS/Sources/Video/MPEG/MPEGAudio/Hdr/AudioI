; Doesn't attempt to support DRAM-less working, since that is expected to
; be done only on newer hardware.

; When false, the code assumes new audio hardware is present, which latches the
; IRQ pulse from the AV110 and clears it on a write to EPROM space (and also
; on reads in the current implementation, which is not very good!)
