; > AudioP

; Makes version of audio module for new hardware that has the audio IRQ fix,
; but doesn't have new ProdType field in the podule EPROM.

; The P version has the TMXC pause fix, i.e. it copes with rev C parts.

; This version does not cope with DRAM-less working.  It is assumed
; that machines which can be operated in this way will have a newer
; version of the AV110 fitted.

; When false, the code assumes new audio hardware is present, which latches the
; IRQ pulse from the AV110 and clears it on a write to EPROM space (and also
; on reads in the current implementation, which is not very good!)
