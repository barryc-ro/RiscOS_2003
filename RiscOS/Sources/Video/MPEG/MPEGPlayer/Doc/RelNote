 !Run
 ----

The !Run file inside !M-Code21 loads the modules required for playback of
MPEG files, and sets the run action for file types BF8 (MPEG) and FFD (Data)
to run the MPEG player program.

Important: The file needs to be customised to the hardware configuration of
the machine.

The system variable InterlaceHW should be set to:
 "s" on machines without interlace phase detection, or
 "w" on machines with Issue 2 MPEG cards (variant that uses Timer1 to workaround bad IRQ latency).

Note that machines without the PAL or NTSC encoder boards do not have interlace phase detection.

The system variable AudioIRQHW should be set to "" on machines with the standard MPEG card
                                          or to "m" on machines with the CC/Wild Vision Movie Magic card

The commands in the file !M-Code21.!Run which set these variables should be
adjusted as necessary. This ensures that the correct variants of the modules
are loaded.

 !RunImage 1.00 (17 Jan 1996)
 ----------------------------

Changes since last release:
 * -bitrate, -highbitrate, -voffset, -yuv
 * Delay before VSP_CloseStream removed, now that underlying problem with MPEGVideo is fixed
 * Support added for stream-based fast-forward/reverse, where the server supports
    it (eg Westminster Cable)

This is the BASIC program which reads in a file and sends it to the MPEG
drivers. It is used both for playing a file off a local hard disc, or playing
over the ATM (or other network) stream interface.

The !Run file sets up the run actions for data and MPEG files to run this
program. The rest of the command line passed to the program consists of the
name of the file to be played, followed by the contents of the system
variables 'Streams' and 'Extras'. These allow a number of control options to
be passed to the program. In addition, to prevent the command line getting longer
than the allowed limit, the system variable MPEGPlayer$ExtraArgs can also contain
control options, although currently this is restricted to the flags which do not take
additional parameters.

The following flags can be passed to the program (eg by sticking them in the
Extras variable):-

        Flag            	Meaning when set

	-highbitrate		Used in systems delivering a high bit rate (3Mbit or above) which need to select a lower memory
				 bandwidth screen mode (in this case an 8 bit-per-pixel mode). Not recommended for general use.
        -hoffset <n>    	Move the MPEG movie position right by <n> pixels. This was added on 30-Sep-94,
                         	 since the Iss.2 MPEG cards seem to have displaced MPEG data, probably due to the
                         	 CL450 timings being relative to the trailing edge of the hsync pulse, which is now
                         	 controlled by the sync generator, not by VIDC20. The Cambridge Trial setup is
                         	 currently using -hoffset -44.
        -voffset <n>		Normally the video decoder is instructed to centre the MPEG picture vertically. In systems where
        			 this positioning is not correct, this flag can be used to adjust the positioning. Not recommended
        			 on MPEG files which are not full height (240 lines for NTSC, 288 for PAL).
        -leave          	Do not attempt to restore desktop screen after finishing. If this flag is *not* present,
        			 the program uses Wimp_ForceRedraw to cause the desktop screen to be redrawn immediately
        			 after finishing, without prompting for "Press SPACE or click mouse to continue".
	-mute			Start movie with sound initially muted.
        -noaudio        	Do not call audio module at all (used for playing video-only files)
        -noautocentre		Disable horizontal auto-centering, for systems where the MPEG output is separate from the
        			 computer video system (eg Movie Magic card).
        -nocls          	Don't clear the screen to 'transparent' before starting (used eg for overlays).
                         	 (NB you must also use -nomode)
        -noerror        	If an error occurs while playing, do not report the error. Instead return to
                         	 the calling application, having set the system variable User$StatusReport to
                         	 hold the error message. If no error occurs, this variable is unset.
        -nointerlace    	Sets bit 6 of the video parameter structure flags, which causes the video module to set
        			 bit 7 of the MPEG card Control Register, which disables interlacing in the sync generator chip.
        -nolipsync      	Audio module doesn't send SetSCR commands to video module
        -nomode         	Don't perform mode change before starting
        -nopalettechange 	Don't modify the palette to enable transparency.
        -novideo        	Do not call video module at all (used for playing audio-only files)
        -novidptss      	Video module doesn't send any PTSs to CL450
        -ntsc           	Use on NTSC TVs
	-paused			Start movie in 'paused' mode. This now causes the first frame of the picture to be displayed
				 before pausing (it used to pause with a black screen).
	-seamless		Used when playing a file which is intended to continue seamlessly after an earlier file,
				 ie without any blank screen in between. It implicitly sets the -nomode, -nocls and
				 -nopalettechange options.
        -skipframes		Enables use of "U" and "D" keys (">|" and "|<" on the remote control) as demonstrators
        			 of the	audio skip-frame and repeat-frame features respectively, used to maintain stream
        			 synchronisation.
        -syncoffset <n>		Add this value onto SCRs received by video module before delivering to CL450
        -task			Perform a Wimp_Initialise before doing anything.
        -uilib <filename>	Specify alternative user-interface library (if not specified, it uses "DefaultUI" in the
        			 same directory as the main program). The interface between the main program and the user
        			 interface library has not yet been documented.
  	-volume <n>		Set volume of playback, where <n> is in units of about 0.5dB; 0 = silent, 256 = full volume
        -wide           	Selects mode 51 (if not -ntsc) which gives 720 x 576 at 13.5MHz pixel rate, in order to
        			 give the correct aspect ratio for White Book (Video CD) discs.
    	-yuv			Program video decoder to generate YUV output, rather than RGB (for use with Macrovision hardware)

The following flags are only for network streaming use:-

        -vspswis        	Use new non-blocking VS_Player SWIs (if not present, uses normal filing system transfers to play file)
        -server <server_name>	Used to specify which server the data should come from.
	-bitrate <rate>		Used to tell network software and/or server what the desired bit rate should be (where supported)

The following flag is highly recommended for network streaming use, and has no effect when playing from a file:-

        -strsync        	Synchronise to stream rate

The following flags are currently only implemented when playing from a file
(ie not network streaming):-

        -from <offset>  	Commence playback from the first pack_start_code after <offset> bytes into file
                         	 - <offset> is any BASIC expression without spaces in it
        -to <offset>		Stop playback <offset> bytes into file
        -buffersize <n> 	Use buffers of size <n> bytes - for CD-ROM drives use n >= about 96*1024
                         	 (defaults to 32*1024 otherwise)
        -loop           	Play MPEG file repeatedly
        -index <filename>	Specify index file for fast-forward/fast-rewind operation
        			- the format of the index file is beyond the scope of this document
        -checktrans		Inspect the file, and if the first byte is &47, then RMLoad the MPEGTrans module, otherwise
        			 load the MPEGCtrl module

The following flags are either obsolete or are used for debugging purposes only:-

        -showtimecode           The time code is displayed as an overlay in the top-right-hand corner
                                 of the screen (together with debugging information)
        -showdatarate           Provides statistics on the rate at which data is being consumed (largely superseded by -ctrlinfo)
        -ctrlinfo               Continually prints out debugging from the MPEGControl module (at present this gives data rate
                                 statistics)
        -audioinfo              Continually prints out debugging from the MPEGAudio module.
        -still                  Attempt to use CL450 hi-res still picture feature (not yet working)
        -vidfile <filename>     Used in conjunction with the VidToFile module (not supplied) which outputs
                                 MPEG video data to a file.
        -audfile <filename>     Used in conjunction with the AudToFile module (not supplied) which outputs
                                 MPEG audio data to a file.
        -lines <n>              Use -lines 288 for UK-based movies, or -lines 240 (default) for US-based
                                 (obsolete: the video module now auto-centres the movie vertically)
        -dropcells              Simulate the intermittent dropping of ATM cells
        -skiptoseq              On startup, blank the screen until the first picture after a sequence header (not yet working)
        -skiptogop              On startup, blank the screen until the first picture after a GOP header (not yet working)
        -subtitles <filename>   Provides hooks for a 'subtitling library' - not very stable as yet
        -stats                  Output debugging statistics to a file

The user interface is now under control of a separate BASIC library.

During playback of a movie (with the default user interface library) the following keys perform certain effects:-

 "S" stops the movie and returns to the controlling program;
 "P" pauses or unpauses the movie;
 "M" mutes or unmutes the sound;
 "2" selects 1/2 speed slow motion;
 "3" selects 1/3 speed slow motion;
 "4" selects 1/4 speed slow motion;
 "F" selects fast-forward, if available;
     if already in fast-forward mode, then it selects a faster speed (up to 4x the original fast speed);
     if in 2x or faster rewind mode, then it slows down the fast rewind;
 "R" selects fast-rewind, if available;
     if already in fast-rewind mode, then it selects a faster reverse speed (up to 4x the original fast speed);
     if in 2x or faster forward mode, then it slows down the fast forward;
 "N" returns to normal play from slow motion, pause, fast-forward or fast-rewind.

If the -skipframes option is enabled then:-
 "U" causes one audio frame to be skipped (and possible consequent skipping of one or more video frames);
 "D" causes one audio frame to be repeated (and possible consequent repeating of one or more video frames).

The keys "Q","Z" and "X" also have certain effects, but they implement
functionality which has not yet been perfected, so they should not be used
at present.

Although the program may grow or shrink its WimpSlot when it allocates buffers (when playing from local disc), it now restores its
original WimpSlot on exit.

The program now always (except when -seamless is used) tells the MPEGVideo module
to blank the screen on startup until the first picture has been correctly decoded.
This means that it can start in the middle of movies without the green blobs appearing.

 Interls 0.39 (06 Dec 1995)
 Interlw 0.39 (06 Dec 1995)
 --------------------------

These are the modules which provide the interlaced screen modes (two variants, only one of which can be loaded at any time).
Each of them provides the following modes:-

 Mode number	Dimensions	Bits/pixel	Frame rate	Pixel rate (MHz)	Notes
 
 	50	768 x 576	16		50		15
 	51	720 x 576	16		50		13.5
 	52	768 x 576	32		50		15			Only available on machines with VRAM
 	53	720 x 576 	32		50		13.5			---------------""-------------------
 	55	768 x 480 	16		60		15
 	56	640 x 480	8		60		13.5
 	57	640 x 480	8		50		13.5			PAL version of mode 56
 	58	640 x 480	16		60		13.5
 	59	640 x 480	16		50		13.5			PAL version of mode 58
 	60	640 x 400	8		60		13.5			for NTSC desktop use
 	61	640 x 400	16		60		13.5			---------""---------
	64	704 x 576	8		50		13.5			Reserved for Macrovision use
	65	704 x 576	8		50		13.5			------------""--------------
	66	704 x 480	8		60		13.5			------------""--------------
	67	704 x 480	8		60		13.5			------------""--------------

Note that the list of modes is potentially subject to change, although modes 50,51 and 55 will not
change.

The changes from the last release are as follows:-

 31-Oct-95  TMD  0.33		Add 58 + 59 (16 bit versions of 56,57)
 09-Nov-95  TMD  0.34		Fixed incorrect header with wrong definition of STB2_MPEG0.
 24-Nov-95  TMD  0.35		Put Macrovision modes in ourself for now.
 27-Nov-95  TMD  0.36		Added modes 60 and 61 (640 x 440 x 8 or 16 bpp) for desktop use on NTSC TV.
 27-Nov-95  TMD  0.37		Put in NTSC Macrovision modes too.
 29-Nov-95  TMD  0.38		Changed NTSC desktop modes 60 and 61 to 640 x 400.
 06-Dec-95  TMD  0.39		Modified timings for Macrovision modes.

 MPEGAudio  0.56 (22 Jan 1996)
 MPEGAudioM 0.56 (22 Jan 1996)
 -----------------------------

This is the MPEG audio module (two variants). The changes from the last
released version are as follows:-

 25-Oct-95  TMD  0.54		Zero SKIP and REPEAT registers on initialisation, to prevent garbled play on first stream
				 in no-DRAM configuration.
 20-Nov-95  TMD  0.55		Check StreamFlags_StartPaused bit passed to ResetStream.
 22-Jan-96  TMD  0.56		Fix failure to set up AV110 address in DoStreamSync, which caused STB2's to never skip
				 or repeat audio frames to synchronise to the stream rate.
 
 MPEGCtrl 0.35 (05 Sep 1995)
 ---------------------------

This is the MPEG control module, which parses an MPEG 1 System Stream
and sends the audio and video packets to the relevant module. The changes
from the last released version are as follows:-

 None - it's the same as the last release.

 MPEGRes    0.03 (19 Oct 1995)
 -----------------------------
 
This module contains embedded within it copies of the files "!RunImage",
"DefaultUI" and "icons", which it registers with ResourceFS. This is to
reduce the time taken to load the player program and associated files which
may take some time to load off slow filing systems, at the penalty of
occupying more user RAM.

This is the same underlying code as the last release, but the programs
embedded within it may have changed - see the descriptions of the individual
files.

 MPEGTrans  1.36 (12 Dec 1995)
 -----------------------------
 
This is a variant of the MPEG control module, which parses an MPEG 2
Transport Stream containing MPEG 1 Video and Audio packets, and sends them to
the relevant module. Eventually this functionality will be merged back into
the normal MPEGControl module, but for now either this module or the MPEGCtrl
module needs to be loaded before opening the stream. The changes from the
last released version are as follows:-

 25-Oct-95  TMD  1.34		(Conditionally) junk audio and video data after ResetStream until we get a video sequence header
 25-Oct-95  TMD  1.35		Remove debugging output of "Bad PES packet header" except when debugging.
 12-Dec-95  TMD  1.36		Remove register loads for debugging output close to start of FullBuffers.


 MPEGVideo  0.86 (22 Jan 1996)
 MPEGVideoM 0.86 (22 Jan 1996)
 -----------------------------

This is the MPEG video module (two variants). The changes from the last
released version are as follows:-

 24-Oct-95  TMD  0.63		Added ReadParameters(4) - read buffer fullness (for debugging).
 25-Oct-95  TMD  0.64		(Conditionally) enable underrun interrupts.
 25-Oct-95  TMD  0.65		(Conditionally) skip initial non-MPEG-start packets. This fixes the problem when
				 repositioning within an MPEG-2 TS where after the ResetStream, data was sent without a
				 preceding NewPacket command, which puts the CL450 into the mode where it ignores PTSs.
 26-Oct-95  TMD  0.66		Blank screen on ResetStream, if flag set in VideoStructureFlags (doesn't work properly).
 31-Oct-95  TMD  0.67		(Conditionally) record last buffer fullness before FlushBitstream.
 01-Nov-95  TMD  0.68		Apply fix for microcode bug 2007 (ie FlushBitstream crashing on full buffer)
 01-Nov-95  TMD  0.69		If in pause mode when ResetStream issued, issue Play command before waiting for not-full.
 06-Nov-95  TMD  0.70		More debugging info added.
 06-Nov-95  TMD  0.71		(Conditionally) don't sent FlushBitstream command if we haven't sent any data nor any
				 NewPacket command since the last ResetStream.
 08-Nov-95  TMD  0.72		More debugging info added.
 09-Nov-95  TMD  0.73		Write SCR to zero in ResetStream. Use correct header for STB2_MPEG0 product type.
 09-Nov-95  TMD  0.74		Undid various debugging workarounds.
 10-Nov-95  TMD  0.75		More debugging info!
 13-Nov-95  TMD  0.76		Stay in user mode throughout wait for data to drain.
 20-Nov-95  TMD  0.77		Check StreamFlags_StartPaused passed to ResetStream.
 23-Nov-95  TMD  0.78		Disable underrun traps - believed to cause frequent crashes at present.
 23-Nov-95  TMD  0.79		Issue dummy OS_ReadEscapeState SWI inside data drain loop, so that callbacks go off on
				 exit from the SWIs, if IRQ callbacks have been indefinitely postponed due to RISC OS bug.
 24-Nov-95  TMD  0.80		Add support for generating YUV output, for Macrovision use.
 29-Nov-95  TMD  0.81		Removed debugging in ResetStream.
 14-Dec-95  TMD  0.82		Try setting border colour before SetBlank, cos it looks like SetBlank is just sampling the
				 border colour at the time, to fill the window, and not updating it when the border colour
				 is changed later.
 14-Dec-95  TMD  0.83		Added new CardControl reason code to send macro commands directly.
 15-Jan-96  TMD  0.84		Added new CardControl reason code to dynamically switch between RGB and YUV output.
 17-Jan-96  TMD  0.85		Added new flag bit to disable vertical auto-centering.
 22-Jan-96  TMD  0.86		Added new ReadParameters reason code to check display is ready (not yet functional).
