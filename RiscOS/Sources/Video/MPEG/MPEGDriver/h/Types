History:
Date		Who	Change
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
20/09/1999	BJGA	Created
07/10/1999	BJGA	Added internal types and public constants
20/10/1999	BJGA	Added video header parser items
22/10/1999	BJGA	API updated in line with issue 2 specification
26/10/1999	BJGA	Separated out picture_t, added picture list
09/11/1999	BJGA	Added (accumulated_data).amount_sent;
			typedef'ed a_v_state;
			structured (program_element_structure).int_flags;
			moved multiple bools into (program_element_structure).vid_flags;
			enumerated (program_element_structure).video_prefill_state
12/11/1999	BJGA	Split picture struct into frame and picture structs
			(to cope with field pictures); simplified video
			prefill state machine
17/11/1999	BJGA	Added frame display linked list; increased frame structs to 5;
			allowed dynamic allocation of frame buffers to frame structs;
			added a few state flags
23/11/1999	BJGA	Added a number of state flags for the improved state machine;
			added a number of new items to struct accumulated_data
25/11/1999	BJGA	Added frame buffer list for new frame buffer allocation scheme
30/11/1999	BJGA	Distinguished current_picture_structure and next_picture_structure
01/12/1999	BJGA	Added ps_frame_picture_extension and prev_picture_structure to
			support switching between field and frame pictures;
			added parsing_headers flag bit for enhanced robustness
02/12/1999	BJGA	Added a couple of flags for added error resilience
07/12/1999	BJGA	Added audio buffer thresholds
28/01/2000	BJGA	Added audio_header and aud_flags
07/02/2000	BJGA	Replaced frame_buffer structs and lists by unsigned ints
			(buffer allocation scheme is now more rigid); added muting
			audio flags and current volume setting
17/02/2000	BJGA	Changes to support audio error counting, and deferred SetSpeed calls
18/02/2000	BJGA	Added audio_slowmo_field_count
07/04/2000	BJGA	Added all clock references and clock-valid flags, PES parsing flags,
			presentation_error, going_faster, going_slower, internal_reset,
			recovering_from_underrun; moved fast_slow_state to apply to video too
