If "<NIM$Version>" = "ATM"      Then Set VSPhyperms$DefaultServer 136.170.38.210
If "<NIM$Version>" = "Ethernet" Then Set VSPhyperms$DefaultServer 136.170.33.72


| Set the default NEC HYPERMS server control port.
Set VSPhyperms$VideoPort 10000


| Set the maximum number of 0.5s video blocks that can be buffered.
Set VSPhyperms$NecBlocks 6


| Set the number of 0.5s blocks to wait for before playing the video stream.
Set VSPhyperms$BufferBlocks 3


| Set MPEG downstream transport type, and parameters.
|
| either  set MPEG$DTType UDP_IP
| or      set MPEG$DTType ATM_AAL5
|
| Note: For NEC HYPERMS this must be UDP_IP.
Set MPEG$DTType "UDP_IP"


| We never use AAL5 as the downstream transport type for MPEG
| so we don't need the MPEG buffers in the driver.

| If the connected network is ATM, set any PVCs to IP destinations additional
| to the STB's boot server, if required.
|
| The format is:   atm25pvc <dest_ip_address> 33 <pvc_number>
|
| Example, to establish a PVC to transport bidirectional IP traffic to 
| host 28.1.1.3 :
|
|                  atm25pvc 28.1.1.3 33 99
|
| Note: The assumption behind this mechanism is that the ATM network infrastructure
|       is configured so that the same PVC numbers are used for bidirectional IP
|       traffic to the same remote IP destination at each STB/ATM switch interface, 
|       with uniqueness obtained via individual Port/VC pairings. For example, the 
|       Port/VC pairings for two STBs connected to Ports A and B on the same switch
|       might be:
|       
|       Port=A,PVC=99    bidirectional IP between STB1 and 28.1.1.3
|       port=B,PVC=99    bidirectional IP between STB2 and 28.1.1.3
