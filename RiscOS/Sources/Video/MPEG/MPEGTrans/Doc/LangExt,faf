 <h2>Introduction</h2>
 The MPEG-2 Systems specification (ISO/IEC 13818-1) allows various
descriptors to be associated with particular programs or program elements.
One of these is the <cite>ISO 639 language descriptor</cite> which indicates
the language of the associated program element, based on a 3-character code
as specified by ISO 639, Part 2.<p>

 This document describes extensions to the API of the Acorn MPEG decoders to
allow the selection for playback of a single audio stream within a
multi-audio-stream program encapsulated in an MPEG-2 transport stream. This
functionality is achieved by extending the operation of the
MPEGControl_SelectProgram SWI call, as detailed below.<p>

 <h2>Definitions</h2>
 <dl>
 <dt><u>Language list structure</u>
 <dd>This is a (word-aligned) array of 32-bit words, where each word has the following
format:
     <ul>
     <li>bits 0..7:   1st character of ISO 639 language code string;
     <li>bits 8..15:  2nd character of ISO 639 language code string;
     <li>bits 16..23: 3rd character of ISO 639 language code string;
     <li>bits 24..31: zero
     </ul>
     The array is terminated by a word which is all zero.<p>
     The structure defines a list of language codes, in priority order. When the
     program map table is parsed, the decoder will try to find an audio stream on the
     specified program which matches the first language specified. If that fails it tries
     to match against the second language, and so on. The list can therefore reflect the
     user's relative fluency in various languages. Having a list also serves another
     purpose: ISO 639 (part 2) defines two sets of codes: the so-called
     'T' (terminological) and 'B' (bibliographical) codes, eg for French the 'T' code is
     'fra' and the 'B' code is 'fre'. Unfortunately the MPEG-2 Systems specification does
     not indicate which of these two codes shall be used; having the list allows
     both codes to be specified, where it is not known which will be present in the stream.

 <h2>SWI MPEGControl_SelectProgram (0x492C8)</h2>
 <pre>
 <h5>On entry</h5>
	R0 =	flags:
		<b>Bit	Meaning when set</b>
		0	R3 = index of video stream to select
		1	R4 = index of audio stream to select
		2	R5 points to a language list structure (see above)

	R1 =	control stream handle

	R2 =	program selector:
		<b>Value	Meaning</b>
		R2 &gt;= 0	R2 is interpreted as the value of the
			program_number field in the program association
			table;
		R2 &lt; 0	-R2 is the index in the program association
			table of the program to select (eg -1 selects the
			first program, -2 selects the second program, and so
			on)

	R3 =	index (within the program map table) of the video stream to
		select, if bit 0 of R0 is set (1 selects the first video
		stream in this program, 2 selects the second video stream,
		and so on)

	R4 =	index (within the program map table) of the audio stream to
		select, if bit 1 of R0 is set (1 selects the first audio
		stream, 2 the second, and so on).

	R5	points to a language list structure, if bit 2 of R0 is set
                (the structure will be copied away, so it need not remain
                valid after this call returns)

 <h5>On exit</h5>
	All registers preserved

 <h5>Use</h5>
	This call is used to select a particular program to decode from a
	single- or multiple-program transport stream. It also optionally
	selects a particular video and/or audio stream within that program
	(eg in the case where a particular program has multiple audio streams
	with dialogue in different languages).

	The audio stream to be played can be selected either by specifying an
	index in R4 (if bit 1 of R0 is set) or a language list structure
	pointed to by R5 (if bit 2 of R0 is set). Note that if both options
        are selected, the language list structure string takes precedence,
	but if no audio stream is found to match any of the language codes,
	then the index specified in R4 will be used instead.
