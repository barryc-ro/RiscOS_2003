        SWI MPEGControl_Stats

On entry:

        r0 = flags (currently zero)
        r1 = control stream handle, or zero for stream-independent statistics
        r2 -> a list of statistic tags, terminated by -1
        r3 -> word-aligned buffer to dump data
        r4 = size of buffer (in bytes)
        
On exit:

        r3 -> after last byte put into buffer
        r4 = remaining size of buffer (negative if buffer overflowed)
        
Use:

This SWI is used to extract statistics from the MPEGControl, MPEGVideo and/or
MPEGAudio modules. The set of statistics to extract is determined by the list
of statistic tags passed in. Each module has its own disjoint range of
statistic tag numbers.

Statistics may be obtained for a given stream (determined by the control
stream handle), or may be stream-independent (eg for statistics which
appertain to the last stream played, or are cumulative over all streams
played so far), in which case a handle of zero should be passed in.

The format of the data dumped into the buffer is as follows:-
        
        Offset  Value
        0       First statistic tag
        4       N = Length of statistic data (in bytes)
        8       Statistic data
        ...
        N+8     Second statistic tag
        
        ...

Unknown statistic tags are ignored - no data is entered into the buffer for
them.

If the buffer is not big enough to accommodate the whole of a particular
item, then no further items will be put in the buffer, but r4 will continue
to be decremented by the size of each item, and an error 'Buffer overflow'
will be returned. Thus if the call returns with r4 negative, then -r4 is the
amount you need to extend the buffer by in order to fit all the data.

Consequently, you can make the call with r3=0 and r4=0, and on exit -r4 will
be the amount of buffer space required for a subsequent call which actually
puts the data in the buffer. Note you will still get the 'Buffer overflow'
error returned from the first call.

Initially the modules are allocated the following tag ranges:

        MPEGControl:    &0000-&0FFF
        MPEGVideo:      &1000-&1FFF
        MPEGAudio:      &2000-&2FFF
        
When the call is made, the MPEGControl module first scans the tag list for
any statistics for itself, then calls MPEGVideo_Stats and MPEGAudio_Stats,
with the control stream handle substituted by the video/audio stream handle,
or zero if zero was originally specified.

Tag values currently recognised are:

 Tag    Value (all of length 4 bytes except where indicated)

MPEGControl:
 &0000  'Bytes received'
 &0001  'In time'
 &0002  'Still skipping to sequence header after a reset' if non-zero
 &0003  'PMT PID'
 &0004  'Video PID'
 &0005  'Audio PID'
 &0006   Amount of data returned
 &0007   Whether skipping until correct trick mode
 &0008   Amount of data discarded
 &0009   Last OVS NPT descriptor (20 bytes of which 18 are valid)

MPEGVideo:
 &1000  'Number of underruns'
 &1001  'Amount received'
 &1002  'Amount sent'
 &1003  'SEQ-V IRQS'
 &1004  'Last buffer fullness'
 &1005  'Last amount sent'
 &1006  'Number of ResetStreams'
 &1007  'Last flush didn't happen' if non-zero
 &1008  'Speed setting'
 &1009  'In underrun condition at present' if non-zero
 &100A  'Last command sent'
 &100B  'Length of pending packets'
 
MPEGAudio:
 &2000  'Skipped frames'
 &2001  'Repeated frames'
 &2002  'Total bytes received'
 &2003  'Sample rate (Hz) - zero => unknown'
 &2004  'Bad SCR values'
 &2005  'PTSs in'
 &2006  'PTSs out/fired'
 &2007  'PTSs missed'
 &2008  'PTSs dropped'
 &2009  'PTSs badsync'
 &200A  'PTSs Q in'
 &200B  'PTSs Q out'
 &200C  'PTSs discard'
 &200D  'PTSs overrun'
 &200E  'PTSs paused'
 &200F  'PTSs slowmo'
 &2010  'SCRs set'
 &2011  'Threshold checks'

Other tag values are for future specification.

Note that the MPEGVideo module only enables counting of underruns if bit 14
of the video structure flags word is set.
