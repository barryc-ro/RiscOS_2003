"Test.mpg" is a four-packet MPEG stream which should exercise the MPEG NDS
code. Best viewed in a byte mode with a width of 188 (one TS packet per
line).

Packet 1
~~~~~~~~
This is the PAT.

Packet 2
~~~~~~~~
This contains the descriptor which contains private data bytes. This has
a CA_system_ID of &007B with which the MPEG NDS client must register an
interest.

The MPEG NDS descriptor handler should process this descriptor and pass
the private_data_bytes on to the client's CADescriptor_Handler. The data
is:

  &12 &34 &56 &78 &55 &AA &55 &AA &00 &FF &00 &FF

That is, 12 bytes starting at a non-word boundary from the start of the
packet.

Given the PID from the descriptor (the CA_PID - &03), we can register the
program element handler.

Packet 3
~~~~~~~~
This contains an ECM. The ECM data is 183 bytes long. It starts on a non-
word boundary in the packet and contains a decending series of bytes,
from:

  &B6 down to &00

This should be passed to the MPEG NDS client's ECMTSPacket_Handler in a
word-aligned buffer, from byte &B3 down to &00.

Packet 4
~~~~~~~~
This contains a packet of scrambled video data. The data consists of 174
bytes in a descending sequence, from:

  &AD down to &00

This should be passed to the MPEG NDS client's Descrambler_Handler in a
quadword-aligned buffer, as a multiple of 16 byte blocks, from byte &9F
down to &00.

The transport_scrambling_control bits which are passed into the handler
in R0 should be 2_01.
