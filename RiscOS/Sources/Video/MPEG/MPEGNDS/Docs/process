Client sets CAD ID with SWI MPEGNDS_RegisterHandlers
  Store CAS ID in a word of module workspace

Client registers function pointers
  Create client block
  Link into client list (head pointer in module workspace)
  Initialise reloc modifiers in client block
  Initialise function pointers in client block
  Set-up registers for call to SWI MPEGControl_RegisterDescriptorHandler
    R0 - 2_0
    R1 - 9 (CA descriptor)
    R2 - <handler code entry address>
    R3 - <client block pointer>

MPEGControl calls our descriptor handler with OpenStream reason code (R0 = 0)
  Create a stream block
  Link into stream list for this client
  Store control handle
  Call client's OpenStream_Handler()
  Store the client handle returned
  Initialise descriptor pointer to point at descrip buffer base
  Initialise descriptor bytes to zero
  Set element PID to -1

MPEGControl calls our descriptor handler with DataTransfer reason code (R0 = 1)



  Set-up registers for call to SWI MPEGControl_RegisterProgramElementHandler
    R0 = 2_1000001010
    R1 = PID
    R2 - <handler code entry address>
    R3 - <stream block pointer>
