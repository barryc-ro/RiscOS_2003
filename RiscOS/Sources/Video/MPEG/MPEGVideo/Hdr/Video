; Makes version of video module for new hardware that has the audio IRQ fix,
; but doesn't have new ProdType field in the podule EPROM.

; The following flag 'AudioIRQBodge' when true does not use bit 3 of the
; Podule status register to detect if an audio IRQ has happened. Instead
; it reads the interrupt status registers in the AV110 directly. This is
; necessary on initial hardware which assumed the AV110 IRQ pin was level
; based, rather than edge based.

; Because of this, the audio performance may degrade, because it will only
; call the audio IRQ code on the back of a video interrupt.

; When false, the code assumes new audio hardware is present, which latches the
; IRQ pulse from the AV110 and clears it on a write to EPROM space (and also
; on reads in the current implementation, which is not very good!)
