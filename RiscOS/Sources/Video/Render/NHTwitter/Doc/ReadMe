This is version 0.07 of the NHTwitter module.

It provides a star command:

 *NHAntiTwitter <x> <y> <w> <h>
 
to anti-twitter a rectangular area of the screen in a 16-bpp screen mode, and
an equivalent SWI:

 NH_AntiTwitter

 On entry:	r0 = x
 		r1 = y
 		r2 = w
 		r3 = h
 		
 On exit	All registers preserved
 
where (x,y) are the coordinates of the bottom-left of the rectangle in
OS-coordinates, and w, h are the width and height respectively of the
rectangle, again in OS-coordinates.
 
The sources for this module can be found on the SrcFiler, in directory
Sources.Trial.WebBrowser.NHTwitter.

Differences from version 0.06:
 * Better sanity checking on the coordinates passed to the SWI. In earlier
versions, specifying coordinates off screen (eg -300,200,100,400) could
result in a crash. From version 0.07 onwards, if the area specified does not
overlap the screen by at least 1 pixel, an error 'Invalid coordinates' is
returned.
