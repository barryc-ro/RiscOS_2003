Crude profiling for 16bpp, rect (1024-200)x(768-200) gives following times:
	Av time to process line (us)
Normal  	263	243	254	226	255
No calc		203	203	157	188	174
No mem		72	72	69	70	60

Memory is dealt with 4 words at a time.

Discovered that cmhg 5.12 is causing module to crash in call-bback
handler...


Screen memory VDU variable doesn't seem to be correct when read in
response to a Service_ModeChange. Am now setting a flag on mode change,
which is then checked by the fader code.

Checked in

Added check to skip fade if value of 128 was transformed into 128.

Added a rather complicated extra bit of code that stores the time that
each colour number was modifed, so that multiple small changes add up.

Above code added to 16/32bpp modes. Version 0.01
