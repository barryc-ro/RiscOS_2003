New idea for Calibration
========================

Calibration code currently specifies a table of interpolation points, given
these when a physical colour is converted it is passed through a function
which works out the two closest points and then interpolates between them
working out which entry matches.

A speed up would be a to expand this table out to be something sensible,
this is then used to convert the physical colour back to a calibrated
version.

Pros:
  
  - Speed


Cons:

  - Requires an expanded table (1K)
 

Does not accept command line operation, simply works as before.  Old style
calibration tables are faulted!
