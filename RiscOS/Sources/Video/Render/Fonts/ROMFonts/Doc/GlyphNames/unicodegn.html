<br><a name=1><b>1. Introduction</b></a><p>

This document describes Adobe(R)'s PostScript(R) glyph naming conventions in
the context of Unicode. The purpose of these conventions is to attach
standardized semantics to glyph names, including glyphs that represent
characters that don't have standard Unicode values (UVs) like certain
ligatures or glyphic variants.<p>

Two perspectives are presented: that of the font developer, when deciding
what to name the glyphs in a font; and that of any process that needs to
extract Unicode semantics from glyph names, such as a Type 1-to-OpenType
converter when creating a Unicode 'cmap', or the search facility in an
application that does not use OpenType layout tables.<p>

The 3 data files referred to in this document are:
<ul>
<li>
  "<a href="glyphlist.txt">The Adobe Glyph List</a>" (AGL). This maps
  approximately 1000 glyph names to standard or Corporate Use subarea (CUS)
  UVs. For more details, including double-mapped glyphs and industry
  standard character sets covered by the list, see <a href="#4">section 4</a>.<p>

<li>
  "<a href="corporateuse.txt">Unicode's Corporate Use Subarea as used by
  Adobe</a>." These assignments cover characters such as small capitals
  which are commonly used in Adobe fonts but are not part of the Unicode
  Standard. This data file also provides Unicode-style character
  decompositions for many of these assignments. For more details, see <a href="#4.b">section 4.b</a>.<p>

<li>
  "<a href="zapfdingbats.txt">Zapf Dingbats Glyph Names and UVs</a>." This
  list should be used only for the font Zapf Dingbats, as described in <a href="#3.a">section 3.a</a>.
</ul><p>

The Unicode Standard 2.1 has been used in this document and related data
files, except for the 4 characters mentioned in the header of the AGL data
file.<p>

<br><a name=2><b>2. Glyph naming</b></a><p>

Font developers should follow these guidelines in all cases where glyph
names are needed: Type 1 fonts, OpenType fonts with non-CID-keyed CFF
data, and TrueType fonts and OpenType fonts with TrueType data that
contain 'post' tables with implicit or explicit glyph names.<p>

<a name=2.a><b>2.a. Maximum name length and permissible characters</b></a><p>

A glyph name may be up to 31 characters in length, must be entirely
comprised of characters from the following set:
<ul>
  A-Z<br>
  a-z<br>
  0-9<br>
  . (period)<br>
  _ (underscore)<br>
</ul><p>

and must not start with a digit or period. The only exception is the special
character ".notdef".<p>

"twocents", "a1", and "_" are valid glyph names. "2cents" and ".twocents" are
not.<p>

<a name=2.b><b>2.b. The uni&lt;CODE&gt; glyph naming convention</b></a><p>

In certain situations described in this document, a glyph needs to be named
according to the uni&lt;CODE&gt; convention.<p>

This means that the glyph name should be of the format "uni&lt;CODE&gt;", where
&lt;CODE&gt; is the glyph's UV represented as a 4-digit uppercase hexadecimal
number. The "uni" component must be lowercase.<p>

For example, the uni&lt;CODE&gt; glyph name for U+054A, ARMENIAN CAPITAL LETTER
PEH, should be "uni054A".<p>

<a name=2.c><b>2.c. How to name glyphs</b></a><p>

Each step below should be considered, in order, until a name is assigned to
a particular glyph. The process should be repeated for every glyph.<p>

In order to verify the choice of glyph name, the result of applying the
algorithm in <a href="#3.a">section 3.a</a> to the glyph name can be compared with the intended
meaning.<p>

Note that font developers can implement a glyph aliasing mechanism in their
production tools that could provide more descriptive glyph name aliases for
uni&lt;CODE&gt; or any other glyph names, as long as the glyph names in the final
font follow the guidelines below.<p>

<a name=2.c.i><b>2.c.i. Standard UV</b></a><p>

    If the character that the glyph represents has a standard UV, i.e. a UV
    assigned by the Unicode Standard, then assign its name as follows:<p>

    If the UV is in the <a href="glyphlist.txt">Adobe Glyph List</a>, use
    the glyph name associated with it in AGL. For example, the glyph name
    for U+00C1, LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH ACUTE, should be "Aacute". If
    the UV is one of a double-mapping in AGL, and if separate designs are
    desired for each UV, then one glyph should be given the AGL name and the
    other should be given a uni&lt;CODE&gt; name according to the table in <a href="#4.c">section 4.c</a>.<p>

    If the UV is not in AGL, use a uni&lt;CODE&gt; glyph name. For example, the
    glyph name for U+0AB8, GUJARATI LETTER SA, should be "uni0AB8".<p>

    If the glyph represents a Unicode surrogate character, name the glyph
    "uni&lt;CODE1&gt;&lt;CODE2&gt;", where &lt;CODE1&gt; is the high-surrogate UV, and &lt;CODE2&gt;
    is the low-surrogate UV. No surrogate characters have been assigned by
    the Unicode Standard as of Version 2.1.<p>

<a name=2.c.ii><b>2.c.ii. CUS UV</b></a><p>

    If the character that the glyph represents is in the data file
    "<a href="corporateuse.txt">Unicode's Corporate Use Subarea as used by
    Adobe</a>," then assign its name as follows:<p>

    If the CUS UV is in AGL, use the glyph name associated with it in AGL.
    For example, the glyph name for CUS U+F761, LATIN SMALL CAPITAL LETTER
    A, should be "Asmall".<p>

    If the CUS UV is not in AGL, the glyph should be named according to the
    uni&lt;CODE&gt; convention. For example, the glyph name for CUS U+F66D, LATIN
    SMALL CAPITAL LETTER A WITH BREVE, should be "uniF66D".<p>

<a name=2.c.iii><b>2.c.iii. Non-Unicode ligature</b></a><p>

    (If this point is reached, the character that the glyph represents has
    neither a standard nor a CUS UV.) If the character that the glyph
    represents is a ligature, or otherwise decomposes into standard
    Unicode or CUS characters, then two formats are available for its
    name:
<ul>
<li>
    <b>Format 1: Descriptive</b><p>

    The decomposition is expressed by joining the glyph names of the
    components, in order, by underscores. The glyph name of a component
    is an AGL or uni&lt;CODE&gt; name.<p>

    For example, the "o f f i" ligature should be named "o_f_f_i".<p>

<li>
    <b>Format 2: Unicode</b><p>

    The glyph name is expressed as "uni" followed by two or more &lt;CODE&gt;s,
    which indicate the UVs of the components of the character, in order.<p>

    For example, the character LATIN CAPITAL LETTER EZH WITH CIRCUMFLEX
    AND GRAVE, which is not in Unicode, should be named "uni01B703020300",
    since LATIN CAPITAL LETTER EZH is at U+01B7, COMBINING CIRCUMFLEX
    ACCENT is at U+0302, and COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT is at U+0300.<p>

    A maximum of 7 components is available with this format due to glyph
    name length restrictions.
</ul><p>

<a name=2.c.iv><b>2.c.iv. Non-Unicode glyphic variant</b></a><p>

    If the glyph is a glyphic variant of a character in category (i),
    (ii), or (iii) above:<p>

    The glyph name is of the form:
<ul>
        &lt;base glyph name&gt;.[&lt;variant descriptor&gt;]
</ul><p>

    Note the period after the base glyph name. An optional variant
    descriptor can follow the period. &lt;base glyph name&gt; is:
    <ul>
<li>
       in AGL, or
<li>
       a uni&lt;CODE&gt; name, or
<li>
       a ligature or other decomposition as described in (iii) above.
    </ul><p>

    Any process which determines semantics from glyph names, such as the one
    described in <a href="#3.a">section 3.a</a>, will ignore the descriptor, if present. The
    descriptor may contain periods or any other permitted characters; only
    the first period in the glyph name is relevant.<p>

    For example, a variant of the "T h" ligature can be named "T_h.swash".
    "T.swash_h" would be incorrect since this will be interpreted as a
    glyphic variant of "T".<p>

    Some of Adobe's internal conventions for variant descriptors are
    listed below; other developers may use or ignore these additional
    conventions as they see fit.
    <ul>
<li>
      Variant descriptors currently in use at Adobe include:<p>

        "swash", e.g. "A.swash", for swashes.<br>
        "begin", e.g. "p.begin", for variant beginnings of words, as in
                some script fonts.<br>
        "end", e.g. "e.end", for variant endings of words.<br>
        "alt", e.g. "a.alt", for alternates.<br><p>

      These descriptors may also include a numbering scheme as described
      below.<p>

<li>
      If there are multiple variants of the same base glyph, then the
      variant descriptors should include zero-padded fixed length numbers so
      that if and when the glyph names are sorted (as in <a href="#3.b">section 3.b</a>), the
      intended order will be preserved. For example, if the "ampersand"
      glyph has 23 alternates, they would be named "ampersand.alt01" through
      "ampersand.alt23", rather than "ampersand.alt" along with
      "ampersand.alt1" through "ampersand.alt22".
</ul><p>

<a name=2.c.v><b>2.c.v. All others</b></a><p>

    If this step is reached, then the glyph has no useful semantic value.
    Examples of such glyphs include ornaments. Any glyph name may be
    assigned as long as it cannot be interpreted as a glyph name from (i) to
    (iv) above.<p>

    Adobe's current internal practice is to name ornaments "orn.001",
    "orn.002" and so on; developers may choose other naming conventions.<p>

<a name=2.d><b>2.d. Additional notes</b></a><p>

Do not use a uni&lt;CODE&gt; name for a glyph that is in AGL (except for one of a
double-mapping), since this might produce undesirable results in pieces of
software that use only the AGL glyph name to test for the presence of a
particular UV in a font.<p>

For example, the Adobe PostScript driver for Windows re-encodes a Type 1
(PFB/PFM) font to a particular Windows code page on the basis of AGL glyph
names; it does not recognize uni&lt;CODE&gt; glyph names. When re-encoding to
Windows ANSI (code page 1252) and printing code point 0xE9 (U+00E9, LATIN
CAPITAL LETTER E WITH ACUTE), for instance, it will print the glyph "eacute"
if present, ".notdef" otherwise, even if the glyph "uni00E9" were present).<p>

Ideally, such an application would first check to see whether the font had a
uni&lt;CODE&gt; name for a particular UV before using the AGL name (including
double-mapped AGL glyph names). However, this might not be acceptable to the
application since the re-encoding array could change depending on the font.<p>

Note that Adobe Type Manager(R) for Windows NT(R) (ATM(R)/NT) tests whether
a Type 1 font supports a particular Windows code page by the presence of the
following UVs. If there are two UVs indicated for a code page then the
presence of either one is sufficient for the code page to be considered
supported.<p>

<br><a name=3><b>3. Extracting Unicode semantics from glyph names</b></a><p>

The guidelines in 3.a should be followed by any application that needs to
determine the meaning of a glyph from its glyph name. Sections 3.b and 3.c
give examples of such applications.<p>

<a name=3.a><b>3.a. Algorithm</b></a><p>

The following pseudocode should be implemented for all fonts except Zapf
Dingbats (PostScript FontName: ZapfDingbats); this has its own separate
Unicode lookup table in the data file "<a href="zapfdingbats.txt">Zapf
Dingbats Glyph Names and UVs</a>."  The pseudocode does not determine the
validity of a glyph name.<p>

".notdef" is special: it is used when a glyph name in a PostScript encoding
does not exist in a font. It does not have a UV and does not appear in AGL.<p>

Note that the UV or UVs that this function will produce might be CUS UVs.
Each such UV can be decomposed into its standard Unicode values by
consulting the decompositions in the data file "Unicode's CUS as used by
Adobe." In the example of "zerooldstyle" in the table above, CUS U+F730
decomposes into "&lt;osf&gt; 0030", a glyphic variant of DIGIT ZERO (U+0030).<p>

Surrogate character names (described in <a href="#2.c.i">section 2.c.i</a>) can be easily
distinguished from two-component non-Unicode ligatures (described in <a href="#2.c.iii">section 2.c.iii</a> Format 2): the high-surrogate UV will be in the range U+D800
through U+DBFF, and the low-surrogate UV will be in the range U+DC00 through
U+DFFF, as defined by the Unicode Standard.<p>

<a name=3.b><b>3.b. Populating a Unicode space</b></a><p>

If an application is interested only in extracting standard or CUS UVs
(categories (i) and (ii) in <a href="#2.c">section 2.c</a>), it can modify the algorithm to
simply delete sections I, IV, and V.<p>

Examples of such applications include a Type 1-to-OpenType converter, when
creating the Unicode 'cmap'; and ATM/NT, when loading Type 1 fonts, since
Windows NT represents all characters in terms of Unicode.<p>

If the uni&lt;CODE&gt; as well as the AGL glyph name for a particular UV are
present, then the uni&lt;CODE&gt; glyph should take precedence at that UV.<p>

If an application wants to encode unrecognized glyphs in Unicode, it should
do so in the End User subarea, by sorting the unrecognized glyph names in
the font by increasing ASCII order, and assigning them to a contiguous run
of UVs starting at U+E000, the lower end of the Private Use Area. If this
run of UVs overlaps with the UV assigned to a glyph with a uni&lt;CODE&gt; name,
the results are undefined. The Unicode Standard makes no provision for
avoiding a "stack-heap collision" between the End User subarea and
CUS. Furthermore, Microsoft(R) will treat the range U+F000 through U+F0FF as
the definition of its symbol code page.<p>

<a name=3.c><b>3.c. Search and copy/paste facilities</b></a><p>

If a font's glyphs have been properly named, search facilities can
accurately locate all glyphic variants of the seach string's characters.
For example, if the user types in the letter "t", then glyphs "t", "Tsmall",
"t.swash", "t.begin", and "t.end" can all be matched.<p>

The same principle applies to copy/paste facilities. For example, glyph
"ampersand.alt01", when copied and pasted from one application into another,
would be known to be a glyphic variant of AMPERSAND (U+0026), and the
regular ampersand could be used to display the character as a fallback
strategy.<p>

Note that applications that have access to a font's OpenType layout tables
can also glean this information from the various features in the glyph
substitution ('GSUB') table. This would be the only recourse to identify
non-Unicode glyphic variants for fonts that do not have glyph names, such as
OpenType fonts with CID-keyed CFF data.<p>

<p>

The glyphs in Zapf Dingbats are in a separate table and are recognized by
the UV-assigning algorithm as a special case (see <a href="#3.a">section 3.a</a>).<p>

<a name=4.b><b>4.b. Corporate Use subarea</b></a><p>

The Unicode Standard states that character assignments in the CUS could be
completely internal, hidden from end users, and used only for
vendor-specific application support, or could be published as
vendor-specific character assignments available to applications and end
users.<p>

The CUS characters in AGL fall into the latter category in that they are
available to end users; however, several of them, such as the Cyrillic
glyphic variants, are not vendor-specific, and would be useful to several
vendors.<p>

In fact, we envision the CUS as a collaborative effort among vendors,
wherein each vendor ensures that new assignments do not overlap with
existing ones. This shared approach ensures optimal use of the limited UVs
available. It also avoids the obvious problems that applications would have
in identifying the vendor of a font in order to determine which vendor's CUS
assignments were in effect.<p>

In addition, we regard CUS assignments as useful until OpenType features
become widely available in fonts and supported by applications.<p>

Apple has published CUS assignments in the range U+F800 through
U+F8FF. Adobe uses CUS assignments in the range U+F600 through U+F7FF, as
well as the same assignments for some characters in Symbol and Zapf Dingbats
from the Apple-defined range. Microsoft is treating the range U+F000
through U+F0FF as the definition of its symbol code page.<p>

Glyph names of future CUS characters should follow the uni&lt;CODE&gt; naming
convention.<p>

See the data file "<a href="corporateuse.txt">Unicode's CUS as used by
Adobe</a>" for a description of the CUS assignments and their Unicode-style
character decompositions.<p>

<a name=4.c><b>4.c. Double-mappings</b></a><p>

AGL contains certain double-mappings, i.e. glyphs that are mapped to two UVs
for compatibility with legacy fonts. If a developer wishes to provide
separate designs for a double-mapping (see <a href="#2.c.i">section 2.c.i</a>), then one of the UVs
may have a uni&lt;CODE&gt; glyph name. AGL 1.2 contains the following
double-mapped glyphs:<p>

For example, if different designs are desired for MICRO SIGN (U+00B5) and
GREEK SMALL LETTER MU (U+03BC), then glyph "mu" should be designed as MICRO
SIGN and glyph "uni03BC" should be designed as GREEK SMALL LETTER MU.<p>

Developers should be aware, however, that the Adobe PostScript driver for
Windows re-encodes a Type 1 (PFB/PFM) font to a particular Windows code page
on the basis of AGL glyph names; it does not recognize uni&lt;CODE&gt; glyph
names. For example, when the driver needs to re-encode to Windows Greek, it
will use glyph "mu" for both Windows Greek code point 0xB5 (MICRO SIGN) and
code point 0xEC (GREEK SMALL LETTER MU), even if the glyph "uni03BC" were
present.<p>

This limitation is not present for GDI printing with OpenType or TrueType
fonts. Adobe's current plans are to provide separate designs for some
double-mappings in OpenType fonts. If developers produce PFB fonts that have
separate designs for double-mappings, ensuring that the advance widths of
both glyphs in each pair of designs is the same will prevent line rewrap in
the problem situation.<p>
