                          FILE COMPRESSION


The term "compression" means to reduce in size.   Computer file
compression refers to reducing files in size so that they take up less
storage space on disk.  PKZIP will perform this reducing process quickly
and easily.  The compressed files are then stored in a special file
called a ZIP file.

     ZIP files have three distinct benefits:

         1.  They use less disk space than normal files.  Storing files in
             compressed form increases the life and storage availability of
             your expensive hard disk.

         2.  Many individual files can be compressed into a single ZIP
             file.  This makes file group identification, copying, and
             transporting faster and easier.

         3.  Compressed files travel faster via modem which reduces
             telecommunication transmission and reception.  Many BBS
             (computer bulletin board services) use PKware files as their
             standard.  This enables the BBS to store more files and you
             to have transfer files faster and easier.


              TWO RELATED PKWARE PROGRAMS - PKZIP & PKUNZIP

     Together, PKZIP and PKUNZIP handle all of your file compression needs.

PKZIP is the program that compresses files.  This shrinking process is
often referred to as data compression.  Terms you will see during the
compressing process are Storing, Shrinking, and Reducing.  PKZIP also
handles all file maintenance including adding and deleting files, as
well as reporting on technical information from within the compressed
file.

PKUNZIP is the program that reconstructs or extracts compressed files.
In addition to reconstructing a complete ZIP file, it can selectively
release individual files, show files on the screen for fast viewing, or
print them out on a printer.


                          FILE COMPRESSION TERMS

     FILE COMPRESSION is the process of reducing a file's size.  This is
     sometimes referred to as data compressing.

     FILE means the SINGLE name that identifies information on your floppy
     disk or hard drive.

     A ZIP FILE holds file information that has been reduced in size for
     better storage.  It is sometimes called a compressed file or a
     library file.

     A ZIP FILE can be made up of either one or more files compressed
     and stored together under one file name.

 |____________________________________________________________________|


     FILE RECONSTRUCTION  or  FILE EXTRACTION  refers to the process of
     recreating files that have been previously compressed.



             USING PKWARE WITH HARD AND FLOPPY DISK SYSTEMS

PKware works BEST on a hard disk system.

 1.  Even though you are making files smaller, the process used to shrink
     them can BRIEFLY DOUBLE the storage space needed.  When a ZIP file is
     being modified (e.g. files being added), the process creates a new
     ZIP file which will be used as a REPLACEMENT for the old version.
     Both the OLD and the NEW versions will be on your disk until just
     prior to the completion of the process.

 2.  When you reconstruct a ZIP file, the amount of space needed to
     hold that file can double.  A large hard disk drive normally insures
     that enough storage area is available.

     Many compressed files are stored on floppy disks.  The limit to
     floppy storage is the number of characters your floppy system will
     hold:

          Standard double density floppy     360K
          High density floppy                1.2 meg
          3-1/2" floppy                      .7 or 1.4 meg

     You may have problems either ADDING files to a ZIP file stored on a
     floppy disk, or reconstructing files to a floppy disk system when
     the number of characters in the ZIP file is more than 50% of the
     available storage space on the floppy disk.

Consider a standard floppy disk system:

   |                                                                  |
   |               Standard Floppy Disk Drive of 360K                 |
   |                                                                  |
   |  A:> BigFile.ZIP  has 250,000 characters                         |
   |                                                                  |
   |           1.  In order to ADD files to BigFile.ZIP, you need     |
   |               500,000 of space.  The extra space is used to      |
   |               hold a NEW updated ZIP file created BEFORE the     |
   |               old ZIP file is deleted.                           |
   |                                                                  |
   |           2.  When BigFile is reconstructed it might require     |
   |               400,000 of space, but the available space on the   |
   |               disk restricts it to 360,000.                      |
   |__________________________________________________________________|


     There are a number of ways to avoid the limitations.  A thorough
     knowledge of PKware Programs will show you how to:

     1.  Selectively reconstruct files from a ZIP file.  Instead of
         extracting everything at once, you can view file size information
         and then select SPECIFIC files to be reconstructed to a floppy.

     2.  If you have two floppy drives, create the ZIP file file on your
         second disk drive so that you have the full 360K available to you.

     3.  Use the special  -b  command option, which routes the NEW file to
         an alternate disk drive during the compressing process then copies
         it back to the floppy disk upon completion.


                   GENERAL RULES AND DEFAULT SETTINGS

 1.  PKware programs MUST be located in:

     A.  The drive you are working on, OR . . .

     B.  Any directory accessible through the PATH= setting.

         C:> PATH=C:/Utils

         In this example, PKware is in the Utils Directory.  The computer
         will find and execute the program even though you are in a
         different directory or drive because any commands entered will be
         run through the PATH.  Consult your MS-DOS documentation for more
         information.

     C.  Any directory through the use of PATH notation if you are using
         MS-DOS 3.0 or later.

         C:>B:PKZIP  -a  OldFile.ZIP  *.*     PKZIP is located on the
                                              B:> drive

         C:>\UTILS\PKZIP  -v  Stuff.ZIP       PKZIP is located in \UTILS
                                              as indicated in the PATH
                                              notation

 2.  All PKware program commands are typed at the prompt.

 3.  Typed information can be in CAPS, lower case, or a mixture.

 4.  The DEFAULT is  *.*  or ALL FILES when specific files are not named
     (except for the  -d  delete files option).

 5.  It is NOT necessary to type the extension  .ZIP  when processing a
     ZIP file, it will be assumed.  The extension is used in this
     documentation for clarity.


 6.  A help screen is displayed when you type the program name at the
     prompt then press <enter>.  Also typing  -h  on the command line
     will call up the help screen.

            C:>PKZIP      enter       gives you HELP
            C:>PKUNZIP    "            "    "    "

 7.  The notation  PKUNZIP *  or  *.ZIP  will reconstruct all ZIP files
     within the given area.

 8.  During the reconstructing process, the notation *.* will tell
     PKUNZIP to attempt to reconstruct ALL files whether they are ZIP
     files or not.  This would waste time, but will not damage any files.

 9.  The default area for the temporary second ZIP file that is created
     while the original is being updated, is the same path and directory
     location as the original ZIP file.  As this can cause a space
     shortage on a floppy disk, the -b option is recommended.  (See
     Section 3)

10.  The compressing function will STOP if specific, pre-specified files
     are not found.

11.  All MS-DOS file handling procedures can be used:

               Filename.ext          Full file name designations

                  *Name.ext          Names with wild card markers
                      *.ext
               Filename.*
                      *.*
               File?ame.ext

             A:filename.ext          Disk drive and file name

             C:\Lotus\March\*.*      Disk drive and PATH locations

QUICK START - CREATE A ZIP FILE

This section will describe some simple examples, illustrating the
command format for creating a ZIP file.
_________________________________________________________________________

|                         How to compress files                         |
|                                                                       |
|    Use PKZIP to reduce or compress the size of your files.  All       |
|    compressed files are stored in a ZIP file, also know as a          |
|    Library file, while in their compressed state.                     |
|                                                                       |
|    The benefits of Compressing are:                                   |
|                                                                       |
|        - Better use of disk storage area                              |
|        - Faster telecommunication file transfer via a modem           |
|        - Collecting numerous files under a single file name           |
|                                                                       |
|    PKZIP uses 4 areas typed at the prompt:                            |
|                                                                       |
|    1.  The actual program name           PKZIP                        |
|                                                                       |
|    2.  The command options               letter commands              |
|                                          example:  -a = add files     |
|                                                                       |
|    3.  The name YOU give your            NewFile  and  LOCATION       |
|        ZIP file and its location.                                     |
|        If no extension specified,                                     |
|        default = .ZIP.                                                |
|                                                                       |
|    4.  The files that get compressed     any MS-DOS file notation     |
|        into the ZIP file.                                             |
|                                                                       |
| Examples:                                                             |
|                                                                       |
|   C:>PKZIP  -a   A:NEWFILE   *.*                                      |
|                                                                       |
|   This will create a file named NEWFILE.ZIP.  The .ZIP extension will |
|   be added automatically when the ZIP file has been completed.  In    |
|   this example, all of the files in the current directory will be     |
|   compressed into NEWFILE.ZIP.                                        |
|                                                                       |
|                                                                       |
|   C:>PKZIP  -a  B:BUDGET   \LOTUS\Checks.Wks  \LOTUS\Money.Wks        |
|                                                                       |
|   This will create a ZIP file named BUDGET.ZIP on the B drive.  It    |
|   will contain two files, both currently located in the C:\LOTUS      |
|   directory.                                                          |
|                                                                       |
|   C:>PKZIP  -f  FILES   *.TXT                                         |
|                                                                       |
|   This will update an existing ZIP file named FILES.ZIP.  All of the  |
|   files with a .TXT extension that already exist in the ZIP file, and |
|   that are also dated later then those already within FILES.ZIP, will |
|   be updated.                                                         |

Description of Command Options


The commands used in creating a ZIP file will be explained in detail in this section.  You will find that the new command format is much more flexible and easier to use.  Listed below is a summary of important facts to keep in mind while using PKZIP.

- The command options can generally be placed anywhere on the command  line.

- The first filename listed on the command line will be interpreted as the
  ZIP file.

- The command can be typed using either upper case, lower case, or any
  combination.

- All command options for the software must be preceded by a '-' character
  or the MS-DOS switch character (usually '/').

- Most options except where noted can be combined (i.e. "-x -y"
  or "-xy").

- The default values for the command line are as follows:
- If no options are entered, the default is '-a', the add file option.
- If no extension is specified for the ZIP file the .ZIP extension will
  be used.
- If no location is listed for the ZIP file, it will be located in the
  current directory.
- If no file specs (filenames, with or without wildcards) are listed, the
  default is *.* (unless the  -d option is being used).


The following table lists all the options valid with the PKZIP command.  A
brief summary is also given in the table.  The options are explained in
detail, along with programming examples, following the table.


Table 3-1   PKZIP Command Options

Option         Summary

-a             Adds files to ZIP file.

-b[path]       Creates a temporary ZIP file at the specified alternate
               location.  This temporary file is used only in the
               creation of the ZIP file, and will be automatically
               deleted when the process is complete.

-c             Adds file comments to individual files within the ZIP
               file.  Not implemented in first release.

-d             Deletes the specified files from the ZIP file.

-e[a,b][n]     Specifies extra compression method.

-f             Freshens files in the ZIP file.

-g             Encrypts files in the ZIP file.  Not implemented in
               first release.

-h             Calls up a help screen.

-i             Backs up only the files that were not backed up the
               last time.

-l             Displays the license screen.

-m             Adds files to the ZIP file and automatically deletes
               the original or source files.

-o             Sets time and date of the ZIP file to the time and date
               of the latest file contained in the ZIP file.

-p             Stores relative paths with the filenames in the ZIP
               file.  Should be used with -r option below.

-r             Recurses subdirectories from the specified directories.

-u             Updates the ZIP file.

-v[t][r/s/d/n] Views technical information about files in the ZIP
               file.  The files can be sorted by compression Ratio,
               Size, Date, or alphabetically by Name.


There are several size factors you must be aware of when using the PKZIP
command.  A ZIP file can hold any number of files subject to the storage
size of your disk.  You NEED unused storage space at least equal to the
size of the existing ZIP file in order to complete any updating process.


For example, if the ZIP file to be updated is currently 250K, you need
250K for actual storage space and another 250K for the updating process.
This is because PKZIP does not delete the original ZIP file until the
new updated ZIP file has been created.  So at the instant the new
updated ZIP file is completed the original ZIP file will still exist.
Therefore, you would need disk storage space twice the actual size of
the ZIP file.

If this poses a problem to you, it can be counteracted by using the -b
command.  This process is explained in greater detail later in this
section.

This section will give a detailed explanation of the command options
used in the PKZIP command.  Recall that except where noted, several
options can be combined on the command line, and the options can be
placed in any order.

The command options are explained in groups determined by function.  The
options pertaining to adding or updating ZIP files are explained first,
followed by the delete option, view options and miscellaneous options.


-a  Add files to a ZIP file

    This command will add files to either a NEWLY CREATED or EXISTING
    ZIP file.  Same-name files will overwrite those already in the ZIP
    file regardless of which has the latest date.  This is the default
    option if no other options are specified.

     A:>PKZIP  -a  Arrange   Flowers.Txt  Pictures.Wks  Pots.Dbs

    Once the program is finished creating a new ZIP file, the extension
    .ZIP  will be added to "Arrange" making it Arrange.ZIP


-u  Update existing ZIP file

    The existing ZIP file will be updated with files only if they are
    not currently in the ZIP file, or if they are dated later than those
    with the same name already in the ZIP file.

    Although this command is similar to the  -a  Add command, it has an
    update SAFEGUARD.  It will overwrite existing compressed files ONLY
    if the selected files have the most recent time and date.

     C:>PKZIP  -u  OldFile.ZIP   *.Txt  Money.Wks  A:Funds.Wks


-f  Freshen files in ZIP file.

    This option updates files that already exist in the ZIP file with
    same-named files with later times and dates.

    The Freshen option is limited to working with files that ALREADY
    exist in the ZIP file.  It will overwrite existing compressed files
    ONLY if the files have been updated since being added to the ZIP
    file.  It will NOT add new files.

     C:>PKZIP  -f  Picky.ZIP  *.*

-i  Selective BACKUP feature

    This option will add only those files to the ZIP file that were NOT
    backed up the last time.  If the program returns the notation "No
    files found", this means that everything had been previously backed
    up.

     C:\PKWARE> PKZIP -i  allfiles.zip

    In this example, all the files in the ZIP file 'allfiles' that had
    not been previously backed up, will be backed up.


-m  Move files into a ZIP file

    This option will add files to a new OR existing ZIP file then
    automatically DELETE the original or source file.

    The Move option is similar to the  -a  Add  command option except
    that it automatically deletes the original files.  This is a REAL
    TIME SAVER, for example, when compressing an entire directory.  The
    m  option compresses all your files into a single ZIP file, then
    deletes the original files.

    The deletion is completed after the program verifies the ZIP file
    for accuracy.  If an error does occur, such as DISK FULL, the
    original files will NOT be deleted.

     C:\DB> PKZIP  tiny.ZIP  *.dbf -m

    In this example, all the database files will be compressed into
    tiny.ZIP and then will be erased from the /DB directory.

    The -m option is often used in combination with either the -f or -u
    options.


-d  Delete files from WITHIN a ZIP file

    This option will delete single or multiple files within a ZIP file
    using any of the MS-DOS file handling descriptions.  The name of the
    file will be displayed on the screen as it is being deleted.

     C:>PKZIP -d  OldFile.ZIP   Garbage.Txt  Useless.Dbf

    In this sample, Garbage.Txt and Useless.Dbf will be deleted from the
    numerous files in OldFile.ZIP


-v[r/s/d/n]  View technical information about a ZIP file

    This option will display technical information about the files
    contained within a ZIP file.  (The -vt option, explained below, will
    display even more technical information.)  The information will be
    sorted and displayed in the order you indicate.


The following sorting options are available:

r = Ratio of compression, smallest to largest
s = Size of files, smallest to largest
d = date of files, oldest to most recent
n = name of files, alphabetically

If no sorting option is specified, the files will be displayed in the
order they were compressed.

The following information will be displayed about EACH file found inside

-vt[r/s/d/n]  View additional technical information about a ZIP file

    This option will display even more technical information about the
    files contained within a ZIP file.  This option lists the files
    individually in a long format.  (The -v option will display slightly
    less information, and is explained above.)  The information will be
    sorted and displayed in the order you indicate.

The following sorting options are available:

r = Ratio of compression, smallest to largest
s = Size of files, smallest to largest
d = date of files, oldest to most recent
n = name of files, alphabetically

If no sorting option is specified, the files will be displayed in the
order they were compressed.


The following information will be displayed about EACH file found inside of
the ZIP file:

       Filename             Name of the file
       Date and Time        Actual date and time of the file
       Compression Method   Type of file compression used
       Compressed Size      Reduced or compressed size of the file
       Uncompressed Size    Original length of the file
       32 bit CRC value     Numeric CRC value
       Created by           The software and operating system used to
                            create the ZIP file
       Needed to extract    The software needed to extract the compressed
                            files from the ZIP file

The following example will illustrate the technical information
displayed when a ZIP file is viewed using the -vt option.  A portion of
the actual output is shown below.  It will be scrolled on the screen.
The information listed below will be repeated for each file in the ZIP
file.

C:\PK>PKZIP  zipdoc -vt


          Filename: SDK.DOC
     Date and Time: Feb 06,1989  10:23:20
Compression Method: Shrunk
   Compressed Size:     1379
 Uncompressed Size:     2560
  32 bit CRC value: 05b27d12
        Created by:   PKZIP: 1.0 under MS-DOS
 Needed to extract: PKUNZIP: 1.0


-z  Create a Zipcomment

    This option allows you to create a descriptive label for your ZIP
    files.  The Zipcomment will then automatically be displayed by PKZIP
    or PKUNZIP whenever the specific ZIP file is processed.

    When you type in the command, as shown below, you will be prompted
    to enter the Zipcomment.  It can be up to 32 characters long.  The
    -z option can also be used to edit an existing Zipcomment.

    The  -z  option can be used alone on an EXISTING ZIP file or in
    combination with any of the add/update commands.

C:\PK>PKZIP  zipdoc -z

    After entering the above command, the program will prompt you to
    type in a Zipcomment.  After entering the Zipcomment, press the
    <Enter> key to save it.


-b[path]  Create a temporary ZIP file on an alternate drive and path

    This option is designed to be used when insufficient disk space is a
    problem.  Every time a ZIP file is updated, PKZIP creates a new
    pre-ZIP file.  When the updating is completed, the original ZIP file
    is automatically deleted and the pre-ZIP file becomes the new ZIP
    file.  The result of this operation is that you need disk storage
    space equal to at least twice the actual size of the ZIP file while
    updating the ZIP file.

    Disk space is generally not a problem on a hard disk, but can pose
    restrictions on a floppy disk.  If adequate disk space is not
    available, the program will stop.

    The -b option will locate the pre-ZIP file on the path and location
    specified.  This file is used only in the process of updating the
    original ZIP file.  It will replace the original ZIP file and will
    NOT exist on the location specified in the -b option, when the
    update process is completed.  The -b option can be used along with
    any of the update options.

C:>PKZIP a:zipdoc *.doc -bc: -u

    The above example illustrates the use of the -b option.  A ZIP file,
    zipdoc, located on drive A will be updated with all the .doc files.
    A temporary ZIP file, used in the update process will be located on
    the C drive.  This file will not exist when the update process is
    completed.


-e[a/b][n]  Extra compression options

    This option is used to specify a slower but more efficient
    compression algorithm.  The command parameters are defined below.

-e   Specifies the extra compression method.  This method is known as
     Reducing.  If the -e option is not specified, the default method of
     compression is Shrinking.

  a/b
        
      The a and b parameters specify that the extra compression is to be
      applied to either ASCII or Binary files.  If you want to use the
      extra compression method on ASCII files enter  -ea.  If you want
      to use the extra compression method on Binary files, enter -eb.
      If only -e is specified, b is the default file type.  (i.e. -eb = -e)

    The a and b options cannot be mixed in the same command.  For
    example if you want to enable extra compression for both ASCII and
    Binary files, two options are needed (i.e. -ea3 -eb2, but NOT -eab4).

  n

    This is the compression factor.  It is any number from 1 to 4.
    Generally 4 provides the best compression, but is the slowest.  This
    is displayed in the chart below.

n=1  fastest process time, good compression
n=2  (between n=1 and n=4)  Default value
n=3  (between n=1 and n=4)
n=4  slowest process time, best compression

The compression and process time ratings listed above are generally
true.  However, for example, it is possible for n=2 to compress better
than n=3, though this is highly unlikely.  The resulting compression and
process time is dependent on the contents of the files.

If no compression factor is specified the default value is 2.
(i.e. -ea = -ea2)


For binary files, specifying a compression option of  -eb2  will usually
provide an optimal balance of compression and performance.  While
Reducing generally results in better compression than Shrinking, it is
possible although unlikely, that Shrinking could compress better than
Reducing for a given file.  Also, while Reducing is generally slower
than Shrinking, extraction of Reduced files is usually much faster than
the extraction of Shrunk files.

Some example commands are shown below.


C:>PKZIP zipdoc *.* -eb

This command would Shrink the ASCII files and Reduce the Binary files
with a compression factor of 2.  (This option usually provides optimum
overall speed and compression.)


C:>PKZIP -ea1 zipdoc  -eb

This command would Reduce the ASCII files with a compression of 1 and
Reduce the Binary files with a compression factor of 2.


-p  Store relative paths with filenames in the ZIP file

This command allows you to store the directory and path information
pertaining to each file within the ZIP file.  It is meaningful only when
used with the  -r  option explained below.


-r  Recurse through subdirectories

This command allows you more flexibility when creating or updating ZIP
files.  The program will recurse through specified directories when
obtaining files to compress.

For example:  PKZIP alldoc -r  D:*.doc  C:\word\pk\*.txt

This command will search all .DOC files on the D drive and all .TXT
files on the C:\word\pk directory and all directories below.

An entire directory tree can be compressed into a ZIP file and restored
using the -p and -r options.  For example:  PKZIP -r -p stuff will
compress all the files in the current directory, and all directories
below the current subdirectory.  PKUNZIP  can then restore this
directory tree either in the same directory, or at any place in the
directory tree.  (See the -d option for PKUNZIP, Section 4.)


By default, the filename only will be stored, unless the  -p  option is
specified in the command line.  If the  -p  option is used, then the
relative path will be stored.


-l  Display the License screen.

    This command will display the software license agreement.

A:>PKZIP -l


-h  Display help screen.

    This command will display a help screen whenever typed on the
    command line.

D:\PKWARE> PKZIP -h

|      A ZIP file is one which holds much information in a greatly      |
|      reduced space.  Use the PKUNZIP program to reconstruct, or       |
|      extract compressed files from a ZIP file.  An entire ZIP file    |       |      can be reconstructed, or specific files can be delegated to be   |
|      extracted.                                                       |

|                                                                       |
|    This command will reconstruct all the files in the ZIP file        |
|    AnyFile.ZIP.  It will locate extracted files on the A drive.       |
|            C:>PKUNZIP  AnyFile.ZIP   A:                               |
|                                                                       |

|    In this example the ZIP file located in the A drive will be        |
|    reconstructed on the C drive.  The destination is the C drive      |
|    by default.  Only the C files will be extracted.                   |
|                                                                       |
|                                                                       |
|    C:>PKUNZIP \Collect\AnyFile.ZIP  A:  -t                            |
|                                                                       |
|    In this example, the path location of the ZIP file is specified.   |
|    The files will be reconstructed on the A drive.  Also, the ZIP     |
|    file will be tested (the  -t  option) to determine whether it      |
|    has been corrupted.                                                |

Description of Command Options


The command options used in reconstructing a ZIP file will be explained
in detail in this section.  You will find that the new command format is
much more flexible and easier to use.  Listed below is a summary of
important facts to keep in mind while using PKUNZIP.

- The command options can generally be placed anywhere on the command  line.
- The first filename listed on the command line will be interpreted as the
  ZIP file to be reconstructed.  Subsequent filenames will be interpreted
  as specific files to be extracted.
- The command can be typed using either upper case, lower case, or any
  combination.
- All command options must be preceded by a '-' character  (i.e. -v)
  or the MS-DOS switch character, usually '/'.
- Most options except where noted can be combined (i.e. "-x -y" or "-xy").
- The default values for the command line are as follows:
- If no options are entered, the default is -x, the extract files option.
- If no extension is specified for the ZIP file the .ZIP extension is assumed.
- If no destination is specified for the extracted files, they will be
  located in directory that the program is being run from.
- If no file specs (filenames, with or without wildcards) are listed, the
  default is *.*.



The following table lists all the options valid with the PKZIP command.
A brief summary is also given in the table.  The options are explained
in detail, along with programming examples, following the table.


Table 4-1   pkunzip Command Options

Option         Summary

-c[m]          Extracts files to the console [with more]

-d             Uses the pathnames stored in the ZIP file and creates
               the paths on extraction if they do not already exist.

-e             Executes a file from within a ZIP file.  Not
               implemented in initial release.

-g             Decrypts files.  Not implemented in initial release.

-h             Displays a help screen.

-l             Displays the license agreement.

-n             Extracts files from the ZIP file only if they are newer
               than the ones already on the disk.

-o             Overwrites existing files without asking for
               confirmation.

-p[a/b][c][n]  Extracts files to a printer.

-t             Tests the ZIP file for corruption.

-v[r/s/d/n]    Views technical information about files in the ZIP
               file.  The files will be sorted by compression Ratio,
               Size, Date, or alphabetically by Name.

-x             Extract files from the ZIP file.



This section will give a detailed explanation of the command options
used in the PKUNZIP command.  Recall that except where noted, several
options can be combined on the command line, and the options can be
placed in any order.

The command options are explained in groups determined by function.  The
options pertaining to extracting ZIP files are explained first, followed
by the view options, print options, and miscellaneous options.



-x  Extracts files from a ZIP file

This command will extract files from a ZIP file.  Either the entire ZIP
file can be reconstructed or certain files can be specified to be
extracted.  The extracted files will be located in the current directory
unless you specify a destination.  The  -x  option is the default option
for the PKUNZIP command.  If no option is listed on the command  -x
will be assumed.

If a file being extracted already exists at the same destination where
the reconstructed files are being located, the program will prompt you
for confirmation before it overwrites the existing file.

C:\DB>PKUNZIP -x  A:lists.zip  *.dbf  *.txt

In the above example, all of the files with a .dbf or a .txt extension
will be extracted from the ZIP file called 'lists'.  The ZIP file is
located on the A drive.  When the noted files are extracted, they will
be located in the C:\DB directory.


-o  Extracts files from a ZIP file

    This command will extract files from a ZIP file and automatically
    overwrite any same-named files found in the destination where the
    reconstructed files are being located.  The program will NOT prompt
    you for confirmation before overwriting these files.

    Either the entire ZIP file can be reconstructed or certain files can
    be specified to be extracted.  The extracted files will be located
    in the current directory unless you specify a destination.

C:>PKUNZIP  D:\PKWARE> Zfile  *.doc -o

    In the above example, all of the files with a .doc extension will be
    extracted from the ZIP file called 'Zfile' (the .ZIP extension is
    assumed).  As the files are being extracted any files with the same
    name in the current directory will be automatically overwritten.


-c  Extracts files from a ZIP file and displays them on the screen

    This command will extract files from a ZIP file and display them on
    the monitor.  The extracted files will scroll continuously on the
    screen.  The software can be told to pause after each screen of output
    by using the -cm option.

A:>PKUNZIP  STUFF  -c  dates.doc

    In this example, the file 'dates.doc' will be extracted from the
    noted ZIP file, and displayed on the screen.

-n  Extracts only the new files from the ZIP file

    This command will extract files from the ZIP file only if they are
    newer than the same-named ones already on the disk, or if they do
    not already exist on the disk.  This option serves as an overwriting
    safeguard.  It will not allow an older version of a file in a ZIP
    file to overwrite a newer version on disk.  "Newer" is defined as
    the most recent time and date created.

C:>PKUNZIP -n  C:\DB\lists  *.dbf

    In this example, all of the files with a .dbf extension, that are
    dated more recently than any same-named files on disk, or that do
    not already exist on disk will be extracted from the ZIP file 'lists'.

-t  Test the ZIP file

    This option is used to test the files to make sure they are valid
    and have not been corrupted.  The files will be listed as they are being
    tested 'OK' will listed after each file if it is not corrupted.

C:\WORD\PK> pkunzip  zipdoc  *.doc -t

    In the above example all the .DOC files will be tested from the
    ZIP file 'zipdoc.zip'.

-v[r/s/d/n]  View technical information about a ZIP file

    This option will display technical information about the files
    contained within a ZIP file.  The view options can also be evoked in
    the PKZIP command.

    The information will be sorted and displayed in the order you
    indicate.  The following options are available:

    r = Ratio of compression, smallest to largest
    s = Size of files, smallest to largest
    d = date of files, oldest to most recent
    n = name of files, alphabetically

    If no sorting option is specified, the files will be displayed in
    random order, the way they were compressed.

    The following information will be displayed about EACH file found
    inside of the ZIP file:

            Length      Original length of the file
            Method      Type of file compression used
            Size        Reduced or compressed size of the file
            Ratio       Percent reduction in file size
            Date        Actual date of the file
            Time        Actual time of the file
            Name        Name of the file

    The following example will illustrate the technical information
    displayed when a ZIP file is viewed using the -v option.  The actual
    output is shown below.  It is sorted alphabetically by name.

-p[a/b][c][n]  Extracts files to a printer

    This option is used to extract files from a ZIP file and send them
    to a printer for printing.The command parameters are defined below.
    The parameters of the print option must be programmed together on
    the command line.  (i.e. -pac1 is correct,  -p -a -c1 is NOT
    correct.)

-p   Specifies the extract to printer option.

  a/b   The a and b parameters will set the printer device to either ASCII
        or Binary mode respectively.  If no mode is specified, whatever the
        default mode is for the device will be used.

    ASCII mode is commonly used to print text.  It will form feed after
    each file.

    Binary mode corresponds to the COPY command commonly used to send
    fonts or graphics to a laser printer.  It will not form feed after
    each file.

    The a and b options cannot be mixed in the same command.

  c   This option specifies the port that the data should be sent through.
      If c is included in the print option, this specifies a serial (COM)
      port is to be used.  If c is NOT included in the print option, this
      specifies a parallel (LPT) port is to be used.

  n   This is the number of the print port being used.  It can be any
      number from 1 to 4.  If no number is listed, 1 is assumed by
      default.

C:>PKUNZIP -pbc2  PICTURE.ZIP

    In the above example, the files compressed in the ZIP file 'PICTURE'
    will be extracted and printed in binary mode from the serial port
    COM2.

C:>PKUNZIP  stuff *.doc -p3

In the above example, all the .DOC files will be extracted from
STUFF.ZIP to the parallel port LPT3.

-d  Recreate directory paths upon extraction

This command option is uses the pathnames that have been stored in the
ZIP file.  The directory pathnames are stored in the ZIP file by the use
of  -p and -r options explained in the list of PKZIP command options
explained in Section 3.  If the stored output path does not exist at the
reconstruction destination, this command will create them as they are
stored in the ZIP file.

For example:  If the following directory tree exists on drive C.

     root----+-abc--+-dir1
          |      |
          |      +-dir2-+-dir3
          |             |
          +-xyz--       +-dir4
          |
          +-pdq

If you then executed: PKZIP -r -p  A:STUFF  C:\abc\*.*

If you then executed: PKUNZIP  -d  A:STUFF  C:\pdq\newabc

After the PKUNZIP command is processed, the C drive would then look like this:

     root----+-abc--+-dir1
          |      |
          |      +-dir2-+-dir3
          |             |
          +-xyz--       +-dir4
          |
          +-pdq--+-newabc-+-dir1
                 |
                 +-dir2-+-dir3
                        |
                        +-dir4

    All of the files originally in C:\ABC and its subdirectories (dir1,
    dir2, dir3, and dir4) have been restored to C:\PDQ\NEWABC, with the
    directory tree being recreated.

    If this -d option is not specified and pathnames have been stored in
    the ZIP file, only the filenames stored in the ZIP file will be
    used,  any pathnames will be ignored.


-h  Display help screen.

    This command will display a help screen whenever typed on the
    command line.  The help screen will also occur when a command has
    been entered incorrectly.

D:\PKWARE> PKZIP -h


-l  Display the License screen.

    This command will display the software license agreement.

                                                                  |


                   ZIP2EXE - SELF-EXTRACTION UTILITY


ZIP files can be reconstructed without PKUNZIP through the use of
Self-Extraction methods.  This is useful when you need to transfer
compressed files to a person who may not be familiar with file
compression and reconstruction procedures, or who does not have the
PKUNZIP program.  The self-extracting ZIP file is an executable file
with a .EXE extension.  By simply typing in the name of the
self-extracting ZIP file, the PKUNZIP reconstruction process will be
performed.

The ZIP2EXE file will create a Self-Extracting .EXE file from a ZIP file
while leaving the original ZIP file intact.  PKSFX.PRG must be in the
current directory or PATH when creating a Self-Extracting file.  The
program MAKESFX will create PKSFX.PRG from the distribution file.

Using the Self-Extraction utility is much simpler with the new ZIP2EXE
program than it has been with previous PKware software.  The following
example illustrates the process of creating a self-extracting ZIP file.

                                                                  |


                         HOW A ZIP FILE IS MADE

PKZIP creates a temporary pre-ZIP file that has an extension of .!!!
such as in  OldFile.!!!  during the compressing process.  OldFile.!!! is
the upgraded version of OldFile.ZIP

When all of your files have been successfully compressed, the original
ZIP file is deleted and the file with the extension .!!! is simply
renamed with a new extension .ZIP.

It is FASTER to rename the temporary ZIP file than to copy it from
one disk drive to another.  The FASTEST way to create your ZIP files
is to do so from your largest disk drive.  The -b option is used to
locate the pre-ZIP file on an alternate drive location, when your disk
space is limited.



                      USE OF A RAM DISK WITH PKZIP

PKZIP swaps information on and off disk memory as it runs.  This process
is NOT the same as the physical creation of the NEW ZIP file.  The
default drive for this program activity is the drive from which the
program was executed.  You can speed up performance as well as gain disk
space by telling PKZIP which drive and/or subdirectory to use through a
DOS environmental string.  All routing can be directed to your RAM Disk
by using the  Set PKTMP command.

       C:>Set PKTMP=D:   --->  where "D:" refers to the RAM disk



                LAN - LOCAL AREA NETWORK SUPPORT

Both PKZIP and PKUNZIP when opening files for read-only type access will
automatically open files in SHARE "deny write access" mode.  This
pertains to systems running with DOS 3.0 or above, so that files can be
read concurrently by other tasks.  PKZIP uses a unique filename for all
temporary files created.  This allows PKZIP to be run by concurrent
programs or on a network drive without any file contention or conflict.



                    CREATING A PRE-SELECTED FILE LIST

This option is used to create List Files to record file selections you
use frequently.  These List Files can then be typed on the command line
instead of typing all the file names separately.  List Files can be used
with all the PKZIP and PKUNZIP command options.


The procedure for creating List Files is somewhat easier with the new
PKware programs.  The following example illustrates the steps necessary
for creating List Files.

             |________________________________________________|

How to Use the List:

     The List File is preceded by the @ symbol on the command line.  If the
     List File is not in the directory, the @ symbol is put BEFORE the PATH
     designation.

     The List File can be mixed with other options, examples are shown
     below.

            C:>PKUNZIP  -r  NewFile.ZIP   @Group

            C:>PKUNZIP  AnyFile.ZIP   Today.Txt  @Group  @Data

            C:>PKZIP  -u  MoreFile  @Group  @\LOTUS\Accounts

            C:>PKZIP  -a  OldFile   *.Dbf  @OldStuff

               USE OF PKWARE IN BATCH FILE PROCESSING

When running PKZIP and PKUNZIP with other applications, you can test if
the PKware experienced an error by using the DOS error level variable.
PKZIP and PKUNZIP return zero error level if no errors have occurred.

If an error has occurred, the software will return one of the following
error codes:


     PKZIP:     0       No error.
                1       Bad file name or file specification.
                2,3     Error in ZIP file.
                4-11    Insufficient Memory.
                12      No files were found to add to the ZIP file,
                        or no files were specified for deletion.
                13      File not found.  The specified ZIP file
                        or list file was not found.
                14      Disk full.
                15      ZIP file is read-only and can not be modified.
                16      Bad or illegal parameters specified.

    PKUNZIP:    0       No error.
                1       Warning error (such as failed CRC check).
                2,3     Error in ZIP file.
                4-8     Insufficient Memory.
                9       File not found.  No ZIP files found.
                10      Bad or illegal parameters specified.
                50      Disk Full.
                51      Unexpected EOF in ZIP file.

NOTE:

  Please note that if testing errorlevels in a batch file that DOS tests
  the errorlevel not for equality, but for greater than or equal to.
  For example, if the software exits with an exit code of 10, errorlevel
  10 will be true, and so will errorlevel 9, errorlevel 8, and so on.
  Therefore, Errorlevel 0 will always test as true.  Therefore,
  errorlevels should be tested in descending order.

For example:

     pkunzip stuff -d d:\temp
     if errorlevel 51 goto err51
     if errorlevel 50 goto err50
     if errorlevel 10 goto err10
     if errorlevel 9 goto err9
     if errorlevel 4 goto err4
     if errorlevel 2 goto err2
     if errorlevel 1 goto err1
     echo No Error
     goto exit
     :err51
     echo Unexpected EOF
     goto exit
     :err50
     echo Disk Full
     goto exit
     .
