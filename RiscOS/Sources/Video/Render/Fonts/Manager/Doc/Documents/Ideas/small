Priority:

        new-style file at correct size
        old-style file with master font >= required size
        outlines

Cacheing:

        new-style bitmaps - load in directly
        old-style bitmaps - load at top of cache, scale into new block
        outlines - make a master font with the outlines in
          - fonts at different sizes can share master outlines in cache
          - contruct 1- or 4-bpp bitmaps as required
          - two sets of bitmaps - 1 and 4 bpp, both scaled from outlines
