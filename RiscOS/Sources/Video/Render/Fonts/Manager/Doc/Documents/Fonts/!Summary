Instructions
------------

The documents in this directory have been formatted using a text editor,
rather than a word processor.  Please think carefully before needlessly
printing them out - they can be read just as easily on the screen, and the
easiest way to find things is to use Twin's FIND command, rather than
scanning up and down bits of paper.

Come on, you guys - whatever happened to the paperless office!
