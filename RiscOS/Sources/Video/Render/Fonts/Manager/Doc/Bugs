Priorities
----------

1. Encoding stuff
	FIXED: Check that IntMet* checking works (eg. Selwyn with IntMetric1)
	FIXED: Unmapped chars => &E000 range
	Allow aliases in base mapping files

2. FIXED: Find problem with 1-bpp characters (out of memory)
	Potential cache bug in hdr_mapindex - relocator doesn't know they're lists
	(actually doesn't matter yet, as there's only one target encoding per master font)

3. FIXED: FontMax settings changing causes crashes
	(But IME doesn't recache MaruGothic font when fontmax3 changes???)

4. Bitmap fonts to have same encoding as the main font
	(stored in main font dir, without <n> suffix)
	(this means you can only have one base encoding for any given font)

4. Enumeration of mapped characters (for !Chars)

5. Kerning to be resurrected

6. Font_ReadFontMetrics to be resurrected
	(a) Start working with first 256 chars for backwards compatibility
	(b) Extend so you can work with a true 31-bit font

7. Missing character glyph

8. Step forward/backwards in a font string by n chars


Bugs
----
Occasional data aborts
Overlapping composite components when converting to DrawFile and when painting outlines
                      ---- Encoding stuff crashes with low memory
                      ---- Bizarre justification (eg Wimp menus)
                      ---- Missing ideographic full stop

Problems
--------
Outline data soaking cache
Cache clearing when FontMax<n> settings change appears not quite to work (indicative
of a deeper problem, perhaps?)
Can we improve anti-aliasing thresholds?

Untested
--------
16 and 32 bit mode Paint and ScanString
Bitmap font files
MakeBitmaps (and for encoding UTF8?)
Check maximum outline complexity not a problem - arrays in FontEd had to be lifted,
what about the Font Manager?

Incomplete
----------
Dependencies outside first 32 chunks not handled
>64K scaffold data not possible
Detection of Version 8 - why look at chunk[0]<chunk[1]?

Broken features
---------------
Kerning
ReadFontMetrics

Features
--------
Double-keyed encoding files - associated FindFont/ListFonts guff
Option for 15 scaffold lines
EnumerateCharacters call.
Safer LoadFontCache (different font cache addresses)
Replacement for ReadFontMetrics for UTF8 encoding.
Mixed bit length outline data (Edward's 8/12 relative scheme)
Missing character glyph
Character aliases
Unmapped characters => &E000...
PostScript printing
Automatic stroking
