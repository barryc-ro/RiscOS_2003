Work to be done by NRaine:

        Font Manager to support re-encoded metrics files:
            Deal with new file format with > 256 characters
            Remap to suit new encoding
            Rebuild kerning hash table when loading file

        Font_Paint to support the kerning option:
            Structure is already there - just needs an addition to the
            'glue' calculation subroutine.

        PDriverPS needs a font SWI which gives access to encoding files
            For a given font handle, return the full name of the encoding file
            'Symbol' fonts contain a private encoding file
            - we must check that these are in fact correct

        Fonts to be upgraded to support Latin 2-5:
            System.Medium and System.Fixed generated by program
            Corpus.Medium and Corpus.Bold need extra glyphs
            All fonts need Eng, eng and kra
            All fonts need checking by Edward Detyna
            - there are many alternative composite glyphs
            Would be nice to debug !FontEd a little!
            Ditto !FontConv (remaps fonts and checks metrics)

        Font Manager internationalisation to be completed:
            Error messages etc. to come from Messages file
            Reporting of font/encoding names in error blocks

        Font Manager needs thorough testing:
            Check that cache remains consistent:
                in all error cases
                when stuff is being unloaded heavily
                after Font_UncacheFile
                after Font_MakeBitmaps
                after altering the thresholds
                with transformed fonts / strings
            Check efficiency of cache management
                ensure that some types of data don't 'hog' the cache
            Check Font_SwitchOutputToBuffer
                rubout boxes / underlines appearing where they should
            Check design of Font_ScanString
                do kerned strings behave as one would expect
                compatibility of Font_StringWidth etc.
