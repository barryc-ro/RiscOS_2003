StrongARM changes to be made
============================
Sources.PutScaled, around line 415ish, flush the caches before
entering the newly generated code. Alternatively, do it in the
find_or_compile C routine - that way the memory space taken up
by the generated code is more cleanly known, making an IMBRange
SWI easier to implant.

Sources.SprTrans around physical line 2287 (label trns_compiling_complete)
flush the caches after generating the transformation code. AFAICT,
this is a simple compilation into a memory block, rather than using
a set of buffers like the PutScaled routine.
