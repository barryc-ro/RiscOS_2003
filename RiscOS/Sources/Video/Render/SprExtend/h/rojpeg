/* Given a file image and all necessary workspace, scan the file image,
build an array of band pointers into it. file_image points to image_length
bytes, which should be a JFIF file. Only two forms of file are accepted - a
greyscale single-scan file, and an interlaced YUV (YCbCr) file.

A non-zero error code is returned if an error occurred. Reason code in
  cinfo->error_code           (same as returned result)
  cinfo->error_argument       (any additional argument)
Typical reasons include an unacceptable or badly formed JPEG file.

cinfo must point to cinfo->workspace_size bytes of available workspace. This
should be about 50K for typical JPEG files, or 20K + 4*16*max width of JPEG
file you wish to work with. If it's not big enough then
cinfo->error_argument is set to what it needs to be - you are welcome to
allocate more space and call again.

If the file is at the same address as the previous call, and a sample of the
data is the same, then jpeg_scan_file guesses that it's the same data - it's hard to
do a random update to the data of a JPEG file.

width and height say how big the resulting image should be - complain if not
precisely correct. If double size and band buffer is big enough, interpolate
upwards If width==-1 the width test is omitted. If height==-1 the height
test is omitted.

(It would be wonderful to feed in scale factors too, so that strange combinations of
scaling, interpolation etc. made sensible decisions. Unfortunately this requires the
calling code to be prepared to accept an output of an unexpected size, say by a factor
of 2 or 8. Not this time.)

it will fit. On return, if it was requested, cinfo->error_argument1 will have
jopt_INTERP_X set if the interpolation is enabled. jopt_OUTBPP_8 and jopt_OUTBPP_16
are similar, they constitute a request and they only happen if the corresponding

This might be in the already-decompressed band buffer, or it might require decompression
of a band. Only pixels between xmin and xmax in the original scan-file are assured of being correct.

If ycoord is outside the acceptable range (0..image_height-1) the result may well
be trash. */
