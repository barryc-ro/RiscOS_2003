History of HourMake
===================


0.01 (12-Jun-1992)
------------------

Started writing the WIMP front-end. Designed a template file.


0.02 (13-Jun-1992)
------------------

Mostly finished the WIMP section. Wrote most of the module code (excluding
LEDs and percentages) but it doesn't work properly yet.


0.03 (14-Jun-1992)
------------------

Got the module code working. Added the bits to display the percentage bar.
Made it so you can define your own percentage bar with the sprites 'barempty'
and 'barfull'. Started redefining the templates to make room for all the
wonderful options I'm going to put in :-).


0.04 (15-Jun-1992)
------------------

Finished the new templates. Altered the code a bit so they work. Added code
so that you can have percentage bars any width, on left or right of
hourglass.


0.05 (16-Jun-1992)
------------------

Added code so that you can do the 'Animation' type percentage indicators, on
any side of the hourglass. Made it so the multiple-thingy sprite file works.
Tidied up the program a bit.


0.06 (21-Jun-1992)
------------------

Finally found time to make the numerals option work. Added the LEDs code - it
uses delta frame animation (cor!). Made it so that if the pointer was
unlinked before you did Hourglass_On, it stays unlinked. So now the only
thing missing is SWI Hourglass_Colours ('cos I don't know the parameters
yet).


0.07 (22-Jun-1992)
------------------

Made it so the sprites can be any width (it inserts columns to make them up
to a multiple of 4). Also made it so you can use sprites from mode 1. Made it
so if you press RESET while the hourglass is on then the on-count is zeroed.


0.08 (23-Jun-1992)
------------------

Implemented Hourglass_Colours. I'm not 100% sure the parameters are correct,
though.


0.09 (30-Sep-1992)
------------------

Made it so you can use sprites from any 4 colour mode. Tidied the program up
a little bit.


0.10 (04-Oct-1992)
------------------

A couple of bug fixes.


0.11 (16-Oct-1992)
------------------

Fixed bug in the LEDs code where if you used the LEDs with certain percentage
types then they got all mucked up when the percentage indicator appeared.


0.12 (13-Nov-1992)
------------------

Converted it to use the DragASprite module when dragging icons (via update to
WimpExtension).


0.13 (26-Nov-1992)
------------------

Altered it so it uses its own sprite pool, thereby avoiding altering the
users own radio and opt icons. This was also necessary because I've now added
the DoggySoft logo as this is now a DoggySoft product.
