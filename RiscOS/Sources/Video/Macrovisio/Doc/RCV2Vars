There are four system variables relating to horizontal position of the MPEG
and graphics planes. They are numeric variables, ie they should always be set
using the *SetEval command. Increasing the value of a variable will cause the
relevant plane to be moved further to the right. The default values gave
optimal positioning in my engineering tests on an NTSC TV; the values for
the RCV2SN and RCV2EN variables are particularly unlikely to need changing.


Macrovision$RCV2S

This controls the position of the MPEG plane in path 1 (Macrovision mode).
It must be a multiple of 4. The value current defaults to 0 for both STB22
and STB3 if the variable is not defined.

Macrovision$RCV2E

This controls the position of the graphics plane in path 1 (Macrovision mode).
The value currently defaults to 1 for STB22 and 148 for STB3.

Macrovision$RCV2SN

This specifies an additional offset to be applied to the MPEG plane in path 2
(Normal mode). It must be a multiple of 4. The value currently defaults to
16 for STB22 and 4 for STB3.

Macrovision$RCV2EN

This specifies an additional offset to be applied to the graphics plane in
path 2 (Normal mode). The value currently defaults to 57 for STB22 and 80 for
STB3.


There is some code in one of the boot scripts in recent baselines that copes
with the way that any Macrovision module present in ROM will have already set
some of the above variables to its own inbuilt, suboptimal values.

Even with RCV2S set to 0, the MPEG plane is slightly right of centre in
Macrovision mode. Although central positioning in Normal mode can be
achieved by reducing the RCV2SN variable, that would result in the picture
jumping when switching into closed captioning mode.
