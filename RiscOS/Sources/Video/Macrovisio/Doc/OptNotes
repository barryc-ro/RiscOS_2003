NOTES ON THE MACROVISION MODULE
-------------------------------

HEADER FILES

Hdr.MacroA is the header for the MPEG-1 STB hardware.
Hdr.MacroB is the header for the "new variant" MPEG-2 development podule.
Hdr.MacroC is the header for STB22 (MPEG-2) hardware.
Hdr.MacroD is the header for STB3 (MPEG-2) hardware.

COMPILE-TIME OPTIONS

ProvideSWI            -	this should always be TRUE now; when false,
			Macrovision mode must be selected by mode number
			(the mechanism used on STB1)
ExternalSyncGenerator -	obsolete support for STB1 hardware
ProgramCTRL1          -	sets SCART RGB switching line so that the TV selects
			RGB input for mode 0 (path 2) and CVBS input for
			mode 2 (path 1 anti-taping)
			NB: mode 1 currently selects CVBS, is this wrong?
ForceMacroVideoPath   -	bodge for MacroB variant (path 2 not available!)
FMT16                 -	\
UV2C                  -	 |
PRCV2                 -	 | Default values of SAA7183 registers
RCV1                  -	 |
AntiTaping_DOWNB      -	/
RCV2S                 -	pulse start: used to position MPEG in path 1
RCV2E                 -	pulse end: used to position ARM video in path 1
RCV2SN                -	\ offsets to the above to apply
RCV2EN                -	/ when in Normal mode (path 2)
MacroRGB_Off          -	disables RGB in anti-taping mode (prevents
			circumvention of anti-taping)
			NB: RGB also disabled in mode 1, is this wrong?
Have_Double_TDA       -	STB3 has different video switching hardware
Captions              -	closed captioning (line 21 insertion) support
BINV_Var              -	allows the burst inversion feature of anti-taping
			to be controlled via the numeric system variable
			Macrovision$BINV: 0 => disabled, 1 => enabled

OTHER

The module should not allow itself to be killed when in mode 3 (mode 0
switched to path 1 for the purposes of caption insertion) because it is
still on EventV in that case.

VIDCProgTable: perhaps the border should be transparent (40000000 instead
of 48000000)?
