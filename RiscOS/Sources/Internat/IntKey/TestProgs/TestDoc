This directory contains the following test program, designed to check that
the InternationalKeyboard module conforms to the Keyboard Extension Software
Functional Specification (2107,730/FS). See also the TestProgs directory in
Sources.HWSupport.PS2Driver for further keyboard test programs.

 RunCheck
 --------
 
 This obey file runs the BASIC program CheckKeys, saving the output in a file
called 'Data'. You should ensure that you have write access to the directory
before running it.
 
 The output from this program consists of lines of the form:
 
 Key xx Codes: c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 c7 c8

where xx is the key up/down code for the key (in hex), and c1 to c8 are
representations of the buffer codes produced when the key is pressed with all
combinations of Shift, Ctrl and Alt, as follows:-

 c1: Only the key
 c2: Shift + key
 c3: Ctrl + key
 c4: Ctrl + Shift + key
 c5: Alt + key
 c6: Shift + Alt + key
 c7: Ctrl + Alt + key
 c8: Ctrl + Shift + Alt + key

The representations take the following forms:

	-		No code produced by this combination
	"<char>"	Printable character 'char' in range &20 to &7E
	&xx		Non printable code, or a function key code in range
			 &80 to &FF
	&00, &xx	Used for top-bit-set printable characters, and also
			 for Alt+numeric keypad codes

Notes:

 a) The following key up/down codes are omitted from the test:
 	ScrollLock - this would interfere with the printing of the output
 		      of the program - it doesn't generate buffer codes
 	Break	   - Ctrl+Break and Shift+Break would reset the machine,
 		      which would terminate the test prematurely :-)
 	Caps Lock  - would interfere with the codes generated - the test
 		      could be extended to include all states of Caps lock
 		      as well, but this would make the test take ages.
 	Mouse buttons - these have key up/down codes, but don't generate
 		      any buffer codes.

 b) Key up/down code 00 (Esc) appears not to generate any codes, because the
program disables it so as not to terminate the program.

 c) The numeric keypad number keys appear to produce various codes with Alt.
This is because of the feature, whereby any character code can be entered by
holding Alt down, then typing the code number using the numeric keypad, then
releasing Alt. The codes are preceded by &00 because usually this operation
is used to produce top-bit-set printable characters, which need this prefix
to distinguish them from function key codes.
