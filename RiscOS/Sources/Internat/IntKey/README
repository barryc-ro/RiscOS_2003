Use !IKHG to create the assembler source for the keyboard handler tables. Do
this by pressing Escape when finished editing the layout. The generated
source file is saved in !IKHG.Source.<Keyboard>.

The table in file KeyStruct must be modified to point to the tables which
your handler is to recognise (one entry for each country). For example,
the KeyStructureTable for Germany (in Germany.Source.KeyStruct) has entries
for UK (KeyStruct1), Germany (KeyStruct7) and Switzerland (KeyStruct35).
All others default to UK.

Finally, the IntKeyMod file must be modified to pull everything together.
