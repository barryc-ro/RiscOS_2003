!IKHG no longer works - create your layout files textually as described
in Doc.FileFormat.

The table in file KeyStruct must be modified to point to the tables which
your handler is to recognise (one entry for each country). For example,
the KeyStructureTable for Germany (in Germany.Source.KeyStruct) has entries
for UK (KeyStruct1), Germany (KeyStruct7) and Switzerland (KeyStruct35).
All others default to UK.

Finally, the IntKeyMod and Makefile files must be modified to pull
everything together.
