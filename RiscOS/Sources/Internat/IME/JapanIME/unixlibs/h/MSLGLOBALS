/*
	The purpose of this file is to set up those aspects of the environment
	that are global to both the C and C++ library.  The top of the dependency
	tree for the C library is ansi_parms.h.  The top for the C++ library is
	mcompile.h.  In order to avoid duplicating code in these two files, this
	file will be included by both ansi_parms.h and mcompile.h.  Only put stuff
	in here that otherwise would have to have been duplicated in ansi_parms.h
	and mcompile.h.
