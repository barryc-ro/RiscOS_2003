; OSmith 29-Apr-92 Went over tables with a fine tooth comb and fixed them
; all. Accent collation order is correct for Welsh, since it is irrelevent
; in English. Collation order of – (Icelandic eth), ÿ¯ (O slash), ﬂ (German
; sharp s) and ﬁ˛ (Icelandic thorn) is taken from ISO 6937/2-1983.

; Note that the binary numbers in the flag tables have to be read backwards.
; The table below should help in this:

; of ˇ, it's just that we haven't got a glyph for it. û, ü, and ﬂ on the

ToControlTable

; OSmith 29-Apr-92 This table is wrong on Perth, since it is defined as
; being the value of the character if it is typed with the CTRL key held
; down. Thus the table should be held in the keyboard driver module not
; here, and switching keyboards would then need to send round
; Service_TerritoryStarted.

; Personally I think this table is daft and shouldn't exist at all. If
; anyone reading this knows of a good reason why we need this table, then
; please add it to these comments and EMail me.
