; > NCChanges

The source directory NCIntKey is an NC variant of IntKey, with some changes
to the code mappings, primarily for Java support.

The keyboard mappings were changed for both USA and UK PC keyboards, in order
to make Cursor up/down in combinations with Shift differentiable from Page
up/down. The old codes were:

		Normal		Shift		Ctrl		Ctrl-Shift
 Cursor down	8E		9E		AE		BE
 Cursor up	8F		9F		AF		BF
 Page down	9E		8E		BE		AE
 Page up	9F		8F		BF		AF

As you can see, the page up/down codes are the same as for cursor up/down,
but with the effect of Shift reversed. The new codes make all the
combinations unique:

		Normal		Shift		Ctrl		Ctrl-Shift
 Cursor down	8E		F0		AE		BE
 Cursor up	8F		F1		AF		BF
 Page down	9E		F2		F4		F6
 Page up	9F		F3		F5		F7

One consequence of the change is that whereas before in cursor editing mode
the state of the Ctrl and Shift keys was ignored when pressing the cursor
keys, now it will cause the new codes to be generated.
