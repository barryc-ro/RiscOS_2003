   You can find a new version (0.09) of the pinboard module on
net#HighTide.RMokady.Wimp (Log on as RMokady Password IRIT).

   Changes made are:

      1. Added selection to the pinboard.
             
            * Icons get selected when menued on if no other selection.
            * Select / Adjust work like in a filer window.
            * Operations are now done on the selection and not on the icon
              you menu on.
            * Added 'Select all' and 'Clear selection' menu entries.
            
      2. Removed 'Close window' menu entry (Didn't fit new selection model)
          
            * Iconized windows never get selected. 
            * The only thing that can be done to an iconized window is
              moving it to another position by dragging.

      3. Ctrl-Menu action moved to Shift-Menu

      4. Interactive help now gives correct info (I hope).


 Also in the same place you will find WIMP 2.84

   Changes are:
  2.82  
       * F11 action (Toggle iconbar) moved to F12.
  2.83
       * Bug fix: drag user sprite called move address first             
         now calls plot first.
  2.84 
       * Error boxes are now centred on the screen.
       * Fixed bug in 3d writable icons, colour now forced only if icon has a border.
       * Fixed bug in 3d icons, wrong colours in 8bpp modes.
       * Added r3-> list of messages expected if task knows about version
         284 or later.
       * Shift + Full_Size toggle to max size that doesn't hide icon bar.
        
       The last thing makes filer windows jump up when you use it on them
       (even if they don't have to), because of the way the filer sets the
       window extent.


  In case you haven't got them yet, the two other modules in the directory
are:


  Switcher 0.46

  0.45
         * Shutdown box centred on screen.
         * Added restart icon to shutdown dbox. 
         * Moved F12 function (command line) to Ctrl-F12.
         * Added 'Create task window' menu entry and hot key (Shift-F12)
         * Changed Ctrl-Sh-F12 key to be Shutdown not Exit.

  0.46
         * Fixed bug, restart shutdown killed switcher !                      
         * Fixed bug, only turn hourglass on before *Shutdown command, not
           on Ctrl-Sh-F12.


  ShellCLI 0.21

  0.21   
         * Changed New Line printing to VDU 31 sequence when moving the

   Let the bug hunt begin.


                         Ran.
