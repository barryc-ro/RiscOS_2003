Pinboard status

Work stopped due to Risc PC 2 cancellation of 17/9/98.

Pinboard development is complete, but minor bug fixes are required.

Three bugs are reported in the enclosed emails below.

The only other known bug is that an adjust click on the OK of the pinboard
save dialogue should keep the save box on screen.
