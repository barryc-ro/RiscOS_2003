Version 0.32 (SCormie - 16 Oct 1991)
* Fixed bugs in interactive help text.
* With interactive help running, leaving the pointer over the border of a menu
  caused a message token not found error.  This has been fixed so that no text
  is produced.
* Pinboard menu now opens 64 units to the left of the mouse pointer (as
  specified in the style guide).
* Info box template was out of date.

Version 0.33 (SCormie - 21 Oct 1991)
* Now checks size word in DataSaveAck message returned because of a pinboard save,
  if this is < 0 then the destination is treated as temporary eg. <Wimp$Scrap> and
  is not copied to the pinboard save file buffer.
* Fixed bug where pressing return in the pinboard save box created a file of type
  Data instead of Obey.
* Fixed bug where pressing the RESET button caused Pinboard to create an address
  exception in the Wimp.  Basically, Pinboard was left with a list of non-existant
  icons and tried to delete one of them.
* If a window has the caret when it is to be iconised then the caret is removed first.
* Fixed help and syntax messages.
* Stopped pinboard running files when they are dragged off screen.
* The mouse pointer is no longer allowed to leave the screen during a drag operation.
* Tidy changes are now saved in the Pinboard save file (or Desktop boot file).
* Fixed bug where a Tidy operation with a large icon caused bad problems (sometimes
  lost the icon, sometimes got stuck in an infinite number of blank error message
  boxes).

Version 0.34 (SCormie - 24 Oct 1991)
* Error box should have had OK instead of Cancel.
* Now fully internationalised.  Resource files moved from Pinboard to Messages module,
  task name and all error messages looked up in Messages file.

Version 0.35 (SCormie - 30 Oct 1991)
* Double-click on icons now causes a DATAOPEN message to be broadcast.  If no other
  task is interested in the file/directory/application then the message is bounced
  back by the Wimp and Pinboard does a Filer_Run or Filer_OpenDir.

Version 0.36 (SCormie - 1 Nov 1991)
* Shutdown then Restart now starts up the Pinboard task again.
* "Use *Desktop..." error now displayed rather than token when trying to start
  Pinboard when it is already running.
* Now updates x and y positions of icons when snapped to a grid point by grid lock.
* Bringing up the save box no longer stops hot keys from working.
* Loading 8bpp backdrop sprites in 8bpp modes now works.

Version 0.37 (David De Vorchik - 19 Nov 91)
* Uses ColourTrans properly to translate sprite so that can work with true-256 colour
  sprites.
* Updated to use DragASprite in save dialogue (based on CMOS bit!).

Version 0.38 (Steve Cormie - 22 Jan 1992)
* Fixed backdrop code so that a sprite area of the correct size is allocated
  and created.
* Fixed tiling so that edges of the sprite are not chopped off.
* Fixed everything which takes account of the icon bar (the size being used was
  too large so scaled and tiled sprites left a line of background above the icon
  bar in VGA modes).
* When *Pin commands are written to the Pinboard save file, negative numbers caused
  by icons being partly off screen are now preceded by '0' eg. *Pin blah 0-50 500.
  This is required because OS_ReadArgs cannot read -ve numbers (it thinks they are
  flags).
* Save files are now set to type &FEB correctly.
* Bounding boxes of icons on a shifted icon bar are now calculated correctly.
* Added sprite and support for default tiling of LCD background on start up and
  mode changes (if there is no backdrop sprite already).

Version 0.39 (Steve Cormie - 24 Jan 1992)
* Fixed bug where the top of the icon bar was overwritten in rectangular pixel modes.
* Fixed bug in backdrop mode change code.

Version 0.40 (Steve Cormie - 27 Jan 1992)
* Finally fixed backdrop/icon bar overlap properly (honestly!!).

Version 0.41 (Steve Cormie - 20 Feb 1992)
* Fixed bug RP-0961.  Pinboard now reinitialises everything and
  starts from scratch whenever the desktop is started.
* Now uses TerrMgr instead of UpperCase macros.

Version 0.42 (Steve Cormie - 26 Feb 1992)
* LCD backdrop code now uses an ECF, this allows background stipple with centred
  backdrops and fixes square pixel vs. rectangular pixel mode problems.

Version 0.43 (Steve Cormie - 28 Feb 1992)
* Fixed remaining bugs in backdrop tiling (I hope).

Version 0.44 (Steve Cormie - 12 Mar 1992)
* Dragging single TinyDirs icons to a filer viewer no longer copies all of the
  icons (or changes the text colour on the icons).
* Message file and error lookup modified, mainly so that the message file is now
  opened during task initialisation, not module initialisation.  Fixes RP-1617.
* Pinboard now only does a Filer_Run on a double-clicked object.  Filer_Run
  should now be modified to handle SHIFT correctly and broadcast a DATAOPEN
  message (fixes G-RO-9915a).

Version 0.45 (Steve Cormie - 23 Mar 1992)
* Help and syntax of * commands brought into line with their action and manuals.

Version 0.46 (Steve Cormie - 23 Mar 1992)
* Fixed mistake in 0.45 and updated template file.

Version 0.47 (Steve Cormie - 25 Mar 1992)
* Non-interactive file copy from pinboard now works correctly (fixes RP-1951).

Version 0.48 (Steve Cormie - 02 Apr 1992)
* Tidy code now updates icon handles correctly (fixes RP-2158).

Version 0.50 (Steve Cormie - 23 Apr 1992)
* No longer removes caret from iconised windows (Wimp now does this).
* Now responds to Service_Memory.

Version 0.51 (Steve Cormie - 25 Feb 1993)
* Added solid icon drags.
* Iconised windows can go to icon bar (configurable).

Version 0.52 (Neil Kelleher - 15 July 1993)
* Added Fonting Wimp support

Version 0.53 (Neil Kelleher - 1 Sep 1993)
* Added interational help

Version 0.54 (Neil Kelleher - 15 Sep 1993)
* Added -Remove option to backdrop command.
