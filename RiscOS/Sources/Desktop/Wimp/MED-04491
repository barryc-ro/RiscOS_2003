Attempts to Logon to SrcFiler projects fail with the message: Syntax:

NFS mounts are successful.

Same results with 3.96 (Internet 3.53)

Further investigation reveals that the problem is caused by a failed
*nfs:logon command.

e.g.  *nfs:logon -host oak black <password>
      Syntax: *SafeLogon .......

Jonathan agrees that BootCmds is the likely culprit.

He suggested the workaround: *nfs:%logon .....
This works for the SrcFiler (need to edit !SrcFiler.bin.NFSMount).
