Test plan
=========

Opening child windows:
        Opening inside a parent
        Altering stack depth within the parent
        Moving and overlapping within the parent, and with the parent's siblings
        Moving to a different parent, or to the top level
        Moving, scrolling and resizing a child window
        Closing a child window
        Opening several child windows at once
        Deleting a child window

Opening the parent:
        Check alignment options of the children
          Combinations of children that are/n't linked to the work area
          Moving, scrolling and resizing the parent
            Make sure the correct optimizations are carried out
        Opening more than one parent window at once
        Closing and reopening a parent with children
        Deleting a parent window

Braindead redraw:
        Running out of rectangles at all possible points in the process
        Intelligent redraw of whole screen
        Braindead redraw if intelligent one fails (make sure children are redrawn)

Wimp operations:
        Wimp_ForceRedraw with opens pending
        Wimp_BlockCopy with opens pending
        Wimp_RedrawWindow with opens pending
        Wimp_UpdateWindow with opens pending
        Wimp_DeleteWindow with opens pending
        Wimp_SetMode with opens pending
        Wimp_DragBox with opens pending
        Wimp_SetCaretPosition with opens pending
        Altering menu caret selection when child window had caret & parent was closed
