;;                      Send messages for all windows being opened after a mode change, and
;;                        stop using the stack to hold the window stacking order for this

;; 26-Mar-90    2.77    Handle rectangle area full redraw screen better:
;;                        braindead_panic_redraw indicates the state of the rect area full problem:
;;                              2 - not full, everything's ok. If the rect area becomes full this upgrades
;;                                      to a 2.
;;                              3 - has become full once, we are currently in the redraw whole
;;                                      screen intelligently scheme. If the rectangle area becomes
;;                                      full in this state this upgrades to a 3.
;;                              0 - has become full once and all rectangle operations should be ignored.
;;                                      If redraw notices this on entry to redrawing this will downgrade
;;                                      to a 1 with the whole screen as the invalid rectangle.
;;                              1 - has become full whilst doing an intelligent whole screen redraw due to
;;                                      a rectangle area full. This means its time to do a
;;                                      BRAINDEAD_PANIC_REDRAW. Redraw noticing this will commence doing
;;                                      a brain dead redraw sequence (redraw all of all the windows from
;;                                      the back of the stack to the front).
;;                              <window handle> - braindead_panic_redraw is in progress. This handle is the
;;                                      handle of the next window to be redrawn braindead fashion. Once
;;                                      the stack has been redrawn this flag drops to 0 again.
;;                        So, the sequence if the stack is only slightly full (eg a task with a huge
;;                        number of windows is closing down, overflowing the rectangle area as all the windows
;;                        are closed, but eventually leaving a less complex rectangular situation) is:
;;                              2 - then rect area becomes full
;;                              0 - then more rect operations do nothing as the windows are closed
;;                              0 - then the redraw comes along and notices this, downgrading to a
;;                              3 - intelligent redraw happens which has no problems due to the much
;;                                      reduced window stack.
;;                              3 - intelligent redraw finishes and the system settles back to a
;;                              2 - no problem.
;;                        The sequence if there are just too many windows to handle is:
;;                              2 - rect area becomes full
;;                              0 - then more rect operations do nothing, until
;;                              0 - redraw comes around and downgrades to a
;;                              3 - and starts doing an intelligent redraw, after a while of redrawing
;;                              3 - the rect area becomes full (again) causing an upgrade to a
;;                              1 - which the redraw sequence picks up, and skips out to do a braindead
;;                                      redraw sequence.
;;                              1 - braindead redraw sequence starts (clears background then)
;;                              <window handle> - redraw this window braindead fashion, then run out of windows
;;                              2 - no more windows, back to 'normal'.
;;                        Notice in states 0 and 1 rectangle operations should be curtailed, but
;;                          in states 2 and above (unsigned) rectangle area operations are ok (above 3
;;                          the operations should have been vetted by the panic redraw handling to be safe).

;;                          logical colour mapping.  In addition Wimp_SetColourMapping also forces
;;                          re-caching of tool sprites to ensure the cached palette is correct.
