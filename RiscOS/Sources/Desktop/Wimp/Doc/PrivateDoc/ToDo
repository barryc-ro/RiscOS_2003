101 things to do to the Wimp when bored!

 * "I" sequence within a validation string, defines the icon handle returned
   for clicks/pointer sencing on this icon.  Also we have an optional 
    feild for defining the flags for the icon.

 * New bit for radio icons, does not toggle the state of the icon, simply
   selects it, deselecting all the other icons within ESG.  Also, does 
   not deselect on an <Adjust> click.
  
   Click events not returned if the icon is already selected.

 * New action button type, click selects, moving off de-selects, moving back
   on re-highlights.  Releasing whilst highlighted sends event, otherwise
   no event is returned - better UI feel.

 * Template loading, specify wrong name, get WindDefWontFit instead of 
   not found.

 * New icon set for the window with input focus, if present window borders
   get plotted with this set.

 * Packed list of tasks, this can be used for improving tasking speed, rather
   than performing a linear search of the task list each time a null sequence
   has been detected attempt to look within this packed structure of tasks 
   interested in null events - see Chris for more details.
 
 * Tackable menus, drag away any object and it gains a close box - new 
   messages to indicate this has happened giving the window handle to be quoted
   when altering the contents of the menu.

 * Menus that auto width and auto height, gaining new control sequence |I which
   defines that the next piece of text is right aligned.  Adopt the Windows idea of
   using & to indicate the next character is a key short cut.
