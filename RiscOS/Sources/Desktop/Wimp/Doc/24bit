24-bit colour selection in the Window Manager
=============================================

Icons
-----
Icons can specify 24-bit foreground and background colour via
a new "C" validation string. For example,

             C008000/0080FF     = mid grey foreground, orange background
             CFF00FF            = magenta foreground, background as specified
                                    in flags word
             C/00FFFF           = foreground as specified in the flags word,
                                    yellow background

Either or both colours can be specified. Colours specified with "C" override
those specified with "F" or in the flags word. The colour numbers specified
are shifted left eight bits and passed to ColourTrans_SetGCOL. They are
case-insensitive.

It is suggested that the old-style colours should be specifyed to something
sensible in case the program gets run on a Window Manager that doesn't support
this.

To change colour at run-time, the validation string must be modified, then
Wimp_SetIconFlags can be used to force a redraw.
