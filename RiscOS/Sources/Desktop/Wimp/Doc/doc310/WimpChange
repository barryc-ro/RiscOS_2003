Documentaton updates since RISC OS 2.00 release (Wimp 2.00)
-----------------------------------------------------------

As the Wimp is developed, it is often necessary to make alterations or
additions to the application interface.  Sometimes this can be done in such
a way that the new behaviour is 'back-compatible' with the old (ie. it will
not confuse applications which do not know about the extension), for example
where a reserved field can be set non-zero to enable the new feature.

However, it is occasionally necessary to make changes that could
potentially confuse an application which was not aware of them.  In order to
cope with this, the Wimp allows an application to inform it of how much it
knows, by supplying the version number of the latest release of the Wimp
which the programmers have taken into account:

        SWI Wimp_Initialise
            R0 = latest known version of Wimp * 100
            R1 = "TASK"
            R2 -> task name string

        Applications written for RISC OS 2.00 should all have R0 set to 200
        when calling Wimp_Initialise.

This allows the Wimp to provide 'incompatible' new facilities only to those
applications which it knows are aware of them, thereby avoiding
compatibility problems with the others.

In many cases a 'compatible' extension can be made, where it is clear to
the Wimp whether or not the application is trying to use the new facility,
so not all extensions require the application to 'know' about the later
version of the Wimp.

The following extensions are grouped according to which version of the Wimp
the application must know about: note that extensions for a given version of
the Wimp also apply to any subsequent versions, so if R0 is set to 300, then
all features up to and including those in Wimp 3.00 are enabled.

Under Risc OS 2.5 an application can only pass 200 or 300 to
Wimp_Initialise. The wimp will give an error if any other value is passed
in.


Changes applying to Wimp 2.00
-----------------------------
    The following changes apply to any task, even those passing 200 to
Wimp_Initialise

 *  If you press ESCAPE when a Wimp_ReportError box is up, Wimp 2.00 would
    always return R1=1, even if the CANCEL box was highlighted.

    The new Wimp actually returns the code for the NON-highlighted box, ie.
    R1=2 if OK was highlighted, and R1=1 if CANCEL was highlighted.

    Pressing any other key selects the highlighted box, and returns 1 or 2
    as appropriate.

    In either case, if the box that would have been selected is not present,
    the other box is selected.

 *  If any error occurs inside Wimp_Poll (apart from an error in the
    parameters to the call), it is reported by the Wimp itself, and is not
    passed back to any of the applications.

 *  If an Escape Condition is pending when Wimp_Poll is called, or if Escape
    Conditions are enabled, the Wimp will report an error, and will cancel
    the escape condition and disable escape condition generation.  The old
    Wimp would simply go wrong if an escape condition became pending during
    Wimp_Poll (keyboard scanning would cease to work).

 *  If a window is deleted while being dragged, an error is reported by the
    Wimp, except in the case of a menu, where pressing escape causes the
    drag to terminate and the menu tree to be deleted.

 *  The pointer position is preserved over a mode change.

 *  Wimp_CreateMenu now correctly returns an error if the top-level menu
    window could not be created (rather than just leaving it half-created).

 *  When the pointer moves over a writeable menu item, the previous menu
    item is deselected.  Also, if right-click is pressed on a writeable
    item, the caret correctly returns to the item when the menu tree is
    reopened.

 *  On the next call to Wimp_Poll after a mode change, the Wimp issues
    Message_ModeChanged and Open_Window_Requests for all open windows.  If
    the new mode is smaller than the previous one, the windows are also
    forced back onto the screen.

 *  The mode change message and the re-open window messages are suppressed
    if the current task is an old-style one (ie. R1<>"TASK" on entry to
    Wimp_Initialise).  Another mode change will always occur before the task
    exits back to the desktop.

 *  The new command *WimpMode <n> can be used to set the current Wimp mode
    without affecting the configured value.  If the desktop is active, the
    mode change will be executed immediately, otherwise it will take effect
    when the desktop starts.  Note that this command should not be used in
    the product-release form of applications: it is provided so that the
    user can set up the Wimp mode in his boot file.  It may also be useful
    in the !Run sequence of an Arthur 1.2 task, where setting WimpMode 12
    will improve the compatibility of the Wimp with the Arthur version. 
    Note that it is not implemented in Wimp 2.00, though!

 *  Window extent supplied in Wimp_CreateWindow and Wimp_SetExtent is
    automatically rounded to be a whole number of pixels (and is re-rounded
    on a mode change).  The Wimp cannot properly cope with extents which are
    not a whole number of pixels, so it used to be possible to confuse it.

 *  If bit 14 of a window's flags is set, then when the size box of the
    window is dragged, the right-hand extent is ignored.  Thus the window
    owner can receive OpenWindowRequests for positions outside the current
    extent of the window.  It can then call Wimp_SetExtent as required, and
    call Wimp_OpenWindow - in this way a window's extent can be made
    'elastic'.

    Bit 15 of the window flags performs the same function for the lower
    extent of the window.

 *  Double-click can no longer be accomplished using different mouse buttons
    for the first and second clicks.

 *  During the time that a double-click is 'pending' (ie. after the first
    click but before the second), the Wimp changes pointer shape 1 to the
    sprite "ptr_double" in the common Wimp sprite area.  As soon as the
    double-click is cancelled, the pointer reverts to the "ptr_default"
    shape.  Note that the displayed pointer shape will not immediately
    change if an application has set pointer shape 2 at the time.

 *  New configuration values have been added to configure the delay and
    distance the mouse has to move before a drag is started, and the delay
    and distance the mouse has to move before a double click is canceled.

 *  A pending double-click will be immediately cancelled if any of the
    following occur:

      +  Wimp_DragBox is called (eg. in response to a drag button event).
      +  The pointer moves by more than the configured number of OS units.
      +  The mouse is not clicked again inside the configured amount of
         time.

      (*Configure WimpDragMove, WimpDragDelay)

 *  The time-limit for a drag button event is now configurable by the user
    A drag will be immediately reported if a mouse button is held down and
    the pointer is then moved by more than the configured number of OS  
    units.
        (*Configure WimpDoubleClickDelay, WimpDoubleClickMove)

 *  Right-dragging on either scroll bar of a window with 2 scroll bars
    causes a bi-directional scroll, where both scroll bars can be dragged at
    once.  This can alo be started up by calling Wimp_DragBox type 12 (other
    parameters are as for drag types 1..4).  The pointer is turned off
    during the drag.

 *  Wimp_StartTask now returns R0=handle of task started, if it is still
    alive (0 otherwise).

 *  If WimpFlags bit 5 is set, then windows which do not have bit 6 set (no
    screen bounds) are still allowed to move partly off the screen in
    response to a drag of the title bar. Windows are only allowed to go off
    the screen down and to the right.

 *  If WimpFlags bit 6 is set, then windows which do not have bit 6 set (no
    screen bounds) are still allowed to move partly off the screen in all
    directions.

    In fact the windows are still restricted in the following  
    circumstances:

        1) If window flags bit 13 is set
        2) If the window is being opened, and was closed
        3) If a toggle-to-full-size occurs
        4) While you are dragging the size box
        5) Immediately after a mode change
        6) On the next call to Wimp_OpenWindow after Wimp_SetExtent is
           called for a window which is fully on-screen at the time.

    In cases (3) to (6), the Wimp sets bit 21 of the window flags, which
    causes the window to be restricted to the screen area for one call to
    Wimp_OpenWindow only (this causes the bit to be cleared).  Case (2)
    means that when a window is first opened it will be forced onto the
    screen, but can subsequently be dragged off by the user.

    If you are dragging the size box of a window, and you move the
    pointer off the bottom-right of the screen, the Wimp will try to make
    the window bigger.  If it succeeds, the window will be forced onto the
    screen, so it will appear to grow upwards and left.  The speed of
    growing can be controlled by how far the pointer is off-screen.

    Window flags bit 21 is also set automatically by the Wimp when a menu or
    a dialogue window is opened as a result of the pointer moving over the
    relevant submenu icon, or as a result of a call to Wimp_CreateMenu or
    Wimp_CreateSubMenu.  This forces the menus onto the screen normally, but
    allows them to be dragged off-screen if desired.

    Bit 13 of a window's flags can be set to indicate that it should be kept
    permanently on-screen.

 *  The iconbar scrolls if the pointer is moved over either end, even if an
    object is being dragged.


 {    The following should not be documented in the PRM !!!!!!!!!!!   }
 {--------------------------------------------------------------------}

 *  Wimp_CreateIcon can have more parameters which relate to creating icons
    on the iconbar:

        [R1,#0] = -3 => create icon on iconbar to left of icon handle R0
                  -4 => create icon on iconbar to right of icon handle R0
        R0 = handle of icon to open next to, if [R1,#0] = -3 or -4
        R0 = -1 => create icon at extreme left (-3) or right (-4)

    This allows icons to be recreated and deleted (in order to change their
    width, for example) such that they stay in the same relative position on the
    iconbar.  It also allows applications to keep groups of iconbar icons
    together.

 { -------------------------------------------------------------------- }
    The following is what should be in the PRM, it should say that -3 and -4
    are reserved.


    Wimp 2.73 also supports prioritising of iconbar icons, so that for
    example, the RAM disc icon can be positioned immediately to the right of
    the Apps icon.

        [R1,#0] = -5 => create icon on left side, scanning from the left
                  -6 => create icon on left side, scanning from the right
                  -7 => create icon on right side, scanning from the left
                  -8 => create icon on right side, scanning from the right
        R0 = signed 32-bit priority (higher priority => towards outside)

    The Wimp positions the icons so that they are sorted, with those of
    higher priority nearer the extreme ends of the iconbar.  Where icons are
    of equal priority, the position of the new icon is determined by the
    scan direction.

    The priorities assumed for the other possible window handle values are:

        handle = -1                     priority = 0
        handle = -2                     priority = 0
        handle = -3, R0 = icon handle   priority = same as matched icon
        handle = -3, R0 = -1            priority = &78000000
        handle = -4, R0 = icon handle   priority = same as matched icon
        handle = -4, R0 = -1            priority = &78000000

    The various Desktop modules create icons with the following priorities:

        Task Manager            &60000000
        !Help                   &40000000
        Palette Utility         &20000000
        Applications            0

        ADFS hard discs         &70000000
        ADFS floppy discs       &60000000
        "Apps" icon             &50000000
        RAM disc                &40000000
        Ethernet                &30000000
        Econet                  &20000000
        Other filing systems    &10000000
        Printer drivers         &0F000000
        TinyDirs               -&40000000

 *  If R1 bit 7 is set on entry to Wimp_ReportError, the Wimp will not
    produce a 'beep' even if WimpFlags bit 4 is clear.

 *  "*IconSprites <filename>" is now treated slightly differently by the
    Wimp: it will first try to add a suffix which depends on the properties
    of the configured Wimp mode, and if this doesn't work, will use the
    original filename as usual.

    If the configured Wimp mode is a hi-res mono mode (ie. bit 4 of
    the modeflags is set), then it will use the suffix "23"; otherwise the
    suffix is "<OS units per pixel (x)><OS units per pixel (y)>".

    eg:        Configured Wimp mode    Suffix

                        23              "23"
                        20              "22"
                        12              "24"

    This allows applications to easily provide an alternative set of icons
    for hi-res mono modes (when using the new Wimp).  For example, an
    application could provide a set of colour sprites in a file called
    "!Sprites", and an alternative monochrome set in a file called
    "!Sprites23", and then load one set or the other automatically by using
    "*Iconsprites <Obey$Dir>.Sprites".

 *  The Wimp now picks up its ROM sprite area from a file inside
    Resources: (without copying it into RAM).  If the current Wimp mode is
    hi-res mono when the Wimp looks in Resources:, it will use
    "Resources:$.Resources.Wimp.Sprites23"; otherwise it uses
    "Resources:$.Resources.Wimp.Sprites".  The Wimp re-finds the file when
    either it or the ResourceFS module is re-initialised (the latter issues
    Service_ResourseFSStarting and Service_ResourceFSDying to inform the
    Wimp).

 *  SWI Wimp_ReadSysInfo takes the following extra possible arguments:

        In:     R0=1 gives R0 = current Wimp mode on exit
                R0=2 gives R0 -> iconsprites filename suffix for the
                                 configured mode.  When loading sprite
                                 files containing icons, the suffix should
                                 be tried - if the file does not exist, try
                                 the original filename.
                R0=3 gives R0 = 0 => we are in text output mode (ie. outside
                                     the desktop, or in the ShellCLI, or in
                                     a command window).
                           R0 = 1 => we are in the desktop
                           other values reserved (test for non-zero when
                           looking to see whether we're in command mode or
                           not).
                R0=4 gives R0 = 0 => left to right text entry
                           R0 = 1 => right to left text entry
                           this returns the state last set by *WimpWriteDir.

 *  The Wimp supports a code variable "Wimp$State", which can take the
    following values:

        "commands"      Wimp_ReadSysInfo (3) returns 0
        "desktop"       Wimp_ReadSysInfo (3) returns 1
        other values should be treated as 'not "commands"'.

 *  Maximum number of created windows is now unlimited (actually &7fff), not
    64.

 *  There is no limit on the number of memory pages that the Wimp can cope
    with.  However, beyond 16Mb of memory, RISC OS will not work correctly,
    as it may not be possible to fit all the spare memory into application
    space.  Previously the Wimp had a limit of 256 memory pages.

 *  An attempt to set the Wimp into a double-pixel mode using Wimp_SetMode
    now returns a "Bad Wimp mode" error.

 *  The following routines are now allowed to take a window handle of -2 to
    indicate the iconbar (in addition to those which allowed it in Wimp
    2.00):
             Wimp_GetWindowState     Wimp_GetWindowInfo
             Wimp_GetWindowOutline   Wimp_ForceRedraw
             Wimp_DragBox            Wimp_WhichIcon

 *  The default action of Shift-f12 is to toggle the iconbar between front
    and back as follows:

        The 'backwindow' bit of the iconbar's window flags is toggled.

        If the 'back' bit of the iconbar is now set, it is sent to the back,
        otherwise it is brought to the front.

    When the iconbar is brought to the front, bit 11 of its window flags
    ('backwindow') is cleared, and when it is sent to the back, this bit is
    set.  This ensures that the iconbar only has the 'backwindow' bit set
    when it is at the back.

 *  In Wimp 2.45 onwards, the following extra features have been added:

        Wimp_GetWindowInfo
            R1 bits 2..31 -> buffer to receive data
            R1 bit 0 set => just return window header (without icons)
            R1 bit 1 reserved (must be 0)

        Wimp_LoadTemplate
        In  R1 <= 0 => return R1 = size of buffer required
                              R2 = size of indirected data
        Out [R5..] = actual name only if [R5..] on entry was wildcarded

        No error is generated for objects of type <> 1: the object is simply
        loaded into the buffer, and no indirected data processing occurs. 
        This is different from Wimp 2.00, which reported an error in these
        circumstances.

 *  The following new message has been defined:

        Message_TaskStarted (&400C8)

    This is sent by the Filer after it has started up all its children so
    that the TaskManager can 'renumber' it.  This is so that during the
    deskboot saving sequence, the Filer_Boot and Filer_OpenDir commands are
    inserted after the logons returned by the NetFiler.

 *  A change has been made to Message_PreQuit:

        R1!0  = 24 (size)
        R1!16 = Message_PreQuit (8)
        R1!20 = flag word:
                bit 0 set => just quit this task, else desktop being quit
                bits 1..31 reserved (ie. ignore them)

    This allows applications to tell whether they should restart the desktop
    closedown sequence after prompting the user to save any unsaved data. 
    If bit 0 of the flag word is set, then the task should not send a
    ctrl-shift-f12 key_pressed event to the task which sent it the PreQuit
    message, to restart the closedown sequence, but should instead just
    terminate itself.

    Note that if the flag word is not present (ie. the block is too small),
    the task should treat the flag word as having been zero.

 *  Clicking on a greyed-out menu item now has no effect.  Previously it
    used to return a Menu_Selection event (9), with the menu selection index
    of the last item set to -1.  Unfortunately this was indistinguishable
    from the result returned when clicking on the parent menu item.

 *  Message_MenusDeleted (&400C9) is returned by the Wimp, with block!20 =
    menu pointer for the menu tree that was deleted, in the following
    circumstances:

        If a task has a menu tree open, and another task calls
        Wimp_CreateMenu, thereby deleting the first tree.

        If a task has a menu tree open, and it calls Wimp_CreateMenu with a
        different menu pointer than the one last used.

        If a task has a menu tree open, and the user clicks somewhere
        outside the menu tree, thereby closing it.  The Wimp now sends
        mouse clicks as messages if the message queue is not empty, which
        ensures that the click event arrives after the Message_MenusDeleted.

    Note in particular that no message is returned if a menu selection event
    is returned, or if a menu tree is replaced by another with the same menu
    pointer.

 *  The Wimp now deals with shaded menu items somewhat differently.  If you
    click ADJUST on a greyed-out menu item, nothing happens, whereas if you
    click SELECT or MENU on a greyed-out menu item, the menu tree is deleted
    and no menu selection event is returned.  This is because it was
    impossible for an application to distinguish between a click on a
    greyed-out menu item and a click on the parent item for that menu, as
    the selection index for a greyed-out menu item was -1, the same as the
    terminator.

 *  Shaded icons in menus are treated differently from normal shaded icons,
    in that the latter are treated as being 'invisible' to the Wimp -
    Wimp_GetPointerInfo will never return them.  In menus, however, the
    icons are not invisible, but are not allowed to be selected.  This
    allows the interactive help program to see the icons and to ask for help
    on them.

 *  If you set bit 4 of a menu item's flag word (not the icon flags), then
    even if the item is greyed-out (icon flags bit 22 set), you can open the
    submenu if it has one.  This allows a non-leaf node to be greyed-out
    without preventing the user from seeing the submenu.

 *  If a menu title starts with "\", then it and all submenus opened off it
    are reversed, that is:

        Ticks appear on the right, arrows on the left
        Submenus are opened to the left (including Message_MenuWarning ones)
        Left-justified menu items are right-justified, and vice-versa

 *  The command "*WimpWriteDir {0|1}" allows the direction of writeable icon
    text entry to be reversed (0 => left to right, 1 => right to left).  The
    default is left to right.

 *  The command "*WimpTask" allows a Wimp task to be started from within a
    command script.  It works as follows:

        If the command is issued from within a running Wimp task, then
        *Wimptask <command> causes SWI Wimp_StartTask, R0 -> "<command>".

        If the command is issued from outside the desktop, or from a task
        that has not called Wimp_Initialise, then *WimpTask <command> causes
        the Window Manager module to be entered as an application with
        <command> as its parameter string.  The Wimp's application entry
        point calls Wimp_Initialise, then issues SWI Wimp_StartTask with R0
        -> "<command>", and then calls OS_Exit.

    The reason for all this messing about is that it is not possible to call
    Wimp_StartTask from within a "dead" task, since the Wimp would not know
    how to return to the dead task after starting the required task.  In
    order to start a task, it is necessary to be a "proper" application, and
    to be running in USR mode - this is why the Wimp is entered.

    The important thing to know about *WimpTask is that it will exit via
    OS_Exit if you call it from outside a Wimp task.

 *  Bugfix in SWI Wimp_SlotSize: this call used to corrupt R4 on exit if the
    current slot was made larger.  This has now been fixed.

 *  You can now set the size of the next slot as follows:

        *WimpSlot -next <n>K

    The -min keyword in *WimpSlot is now optional.

 *  The values returned from Wimp_ReadPalette are analogous to those
    returned by OS_ReadPalette, in that they always have the bottom nibbles
    clear.  These colours are not correct for passing to ColourTrans: you
    have to make the bottom nibbles into copies of the top ones.
 
 *  If shift is held down when the close tool of a window is clicked, the
    wimp does not close the window, but instead send a Message_Iconize
    containing:

    Message_Iconize: 

      +20  Window handle.
      +24  Task handle for task which owns the window.
      +28  20 Bytes of title string. (last part of first word)
      +48

 *  Whenever a window is closed the Wimp broadcasts the following message:
           
    Message_WindowClosed

      +20 Window handle.
      +24

 *  It is now possible to open a window behind window -3, this will open the
    window behind the Wimp's backwindow, hiding it from sight.

 *  The max. number of tasks that can be active at any one time is now 128
    (was 32)

 *  When Wimp_StartDrag is called, giving user Plot/Unplot/Move routines,
    the Plot routine is now called before the Unplot or Move routines, on
    2.00 the Unplot routine was called first.

 *  If Shift is held down when the Toggle Sixe tool is clicked, the window
    will be opened as big as possible without covering the icon bar.


 *  Validation string for indirected text icons can now have a B (Border)
    command to set the border type for the icon. The border will only be
    drawn if the border bit for the icon is also set.

     B<Type>,<Slab in colour>        To set the icon's border type (This
                                     will override the Wimp's default border
                                     for the icon).

     Where type is:

                  0: 3d raised border.
                  1: Group border.
                  2: Default action border.
                  3: Writable icon border.
                  4: Pressed 3d border.
                  5: Normal 2d border.
                  6: Pressed type 2 border.

                 Border type 0 changes to 4 and 2 changes to 6 when a mouse
                 event is about to be reported to the application, and
                 changes back when you release the mouse button, or when you
                 move the pointer away from the icon. It will not change if
                 the icon's button type means that the click is not reported
                 to the application.

     The Slab in colour is used to set the icon's background colour just
     before a mouse click is reported to the task. 

 * Validation strings for indirected icons can now have a P (Pointer
   Shape) command.

     P<spritename>,active_x,active_y To change the pointer shape while over
                                     the icon.

     Default sprites provided in the wimp sprite area are: 

     Name              Active point
     ptr_write              4,4
     ptr_menu               6,5
     ptr_direct            13,7
     ptr_hand              12,8
     ptr_cross             13,7

 * The wimp supports a new SWI:

   Wimp_RegisterFilter
          Registers a filter to be called on call to or before return from Wimp_Poll
   Entry:
       r0 - reason code:
        0 - Register / Deregister Pre-Filter   
        1 - Register / Deregister Post-Filter

       r1 - Address of filter, or 0 to de-register.
       r2 - Value to be passed in R12 on entry to filter.
   Exit:
       Registers preserved.


   A pre filter is called whenever a task calls Wimp_poll:
   On Entry:
             R0  = Event mask as passed to Wimp_Poll
             R1  -> User block as passed to Wimp_Poll.
             R2  = Task handle.
             R12 = Value of R2 when registered.
   On Exit:
             R0 May be modified by the filter.
             All other register and processor mode must be preserved

   A post filter is called when the Wimp is about to return an event to a
   task.
   On Entry: 
             R0 -  Event code for event that is about to be returned.
             R1 -> Event block for event to be returned. (Owner task paged
                   in)
             R2 =  Task handle of task that is about to receive the event.
   On Exit:
             The filter may modify R0 and the contents of the buffer pointed
             to by R1, to return a different event.

             R1,R2 must be preserved.

             If R0=-1 on exit, the event will not be passed to the task.

   This SWI is provided for the use of the FilterManager, and should not be
   used unless you want to replace the whole filter system. Use the
   FilterManager to register filters for specific tasks.



 * If WimpFlags bit 7 is set and the pointer is kept on a non-leaf menu item
   for more than the time specified by *Configure WimpAutoMenuDelay then the
   submenu will be opened automaticaly by the Wimp.


Changes applying to Wimp 2.18 or later
---------------------------------------

 *  If a message is sent to a menu window, then it will be delivered to the
    task which opened the menu tree.  This applies to any reason code
    greater than CloseWindowRequest, as well as the messages (open, close
    and redraw are all dealt with automatically by the Wimp).

    Typically such a message will contain the window handle of the menu
    window, which will not be recognised by the menu owner.  However, it cn
    make use of the following call to find out which part of the menu tree
    it corresponds to:

        Wimp_GetMenuState
            R0 = 0 => report current state of tree, ignoring R2,R3
            R0 = 1 => report tree which leads up to R2,R3
            R1 -> buffer to contain result
            R2 = window handle
            R3 = icon handle

    The tree is put into the buffer in R1 in the same format as that
    returned by Wimp_Poll reason code 9 (Menu_Select), ie. a list of
    selection indices terminated by -1.

    The tree returned will be null if R0=1 and the window/icon in R2/R3 is
    not in the tree, or if R0=0 or 1 and the menu tree is owned by a
    different application, or is closed altogether.

    If the window is a dialogue box, the tree returned will go up to (but
    not include) the dialogue box.


Changes applying to Wimp 2.23
-----------------------------

 *  Wimp_Poll or Wimp_PollIdle can be called as follows:

        If R0 bit 13 is clear, then:

            R0 bit 22 set => scan 'poll word' pointed to by R3
            R0 bit 23 set => scan the poll word at high priority
            R3 -> poll word (NOT in application space)

    The Wimp will normally scan the word after delivering any outstanding
    messages and issuing any Redraw_Window_Requests that are required, so
    that the application can then update its windows etc. as required.

    If R0 bit 23 was set, the poll word will be scanned before the messages
    or the Redraw_Window_Requests are delivered.  Note that this means that
    the screen may not yet be up-to-date, and certain messages may not have
    been delivered (in particular Message_ModeChange).

    If the Wimp discovers that the word has become non-zero, it will return
    the following event from Wimp_Poll:

        R0 = 13 (PollWord_NonZero)
        [R1,#0] = address of poll word
        [R1,#4] = contents of poll word

    This facility is used to transfer control to a task's foreground
    process, where control is currently in an interrupt routine, service
    call handler or the like.

    For example, the NetFiler module intercepts a special service call which
    is issued by NetFS whenever a *Logon, *Bye or *SDisc is executed.  This
    tells NetFiler that it should re-scan its list of fileservers and update
    the iconbar as appropriate, but it cannot do this directly because it
    needs to get control in the foreground in order to call the Wimp.

    It therefore sets a flag in its workspace, which tells it that it should
    rescan the list the next time the Wimp returns to it from Wimp_Poll. 
    Using the new facility, it can use a 'fast poll' to get the Wimp to tell
    it BEFORE the screen is up-to-date, which means that if the user issues
    a *Logon from within ShellCLI, the NetFiler can update the iconbar
    before the screen is redrawn when ShellCLI returns, and so the iconbar
    does not have to be redrawn twice.

    A more normal application for this would be for a background process to
    buffer incoming data in the RMA, and to signal to its foreground process
    when there was enough data to use.  It would normally use the 'slow'
    form of polling, so that it could update its window with the new data.

    Note that there is still no guarantee about how long it will take before
    the application regains control, since other applications can take
    control away from the Wimp for arbitrarily long periods of time (eg.
    ShellCLI).

 *  Wimp_Poll or Wimp_PollIdle can be called as follows:

            R0 bit 24 set => save / restore FP registers
            R1 -> poll block
            R2 = earliest return time (for Wimp_PollIdle)
            R3 -> poll word (if R0 bit 22 set - see above)

    The floating point registers should only be saved if one or more of the
    following is true:

      * The task is controlling arbitrary applications 'underneath' it,
        which may use floating point instructions.  An example of such a
        controlling task is the TaskWindow module.

      * The task requires to set up a floating point status register value
        that is different from that used by the C run-time system (which
        happens to be &70000).

        This is because in general other C programs running under the Wimp
        that use floating point will not save their FP registers, but will
        assume that the status register is still correct for the C run-time
        environment.

        To enable this to work, the Wimp resets the FP status register to
        the correct value for the C run-time environment immediately after
        saving the FP registers for a task that requests it.

    There is one complication with this: when the Wimp comes to save the
    floating point registers for a task, it is possible (when using the
    actual FP hardware, as opposed to the emulator) for an asynchronous
    exception to be generated (eg. after a divide by 0, the next FP
    instruction is the one that actually generates the error).

    In this case OS_GenerateError is called by the FP support code, once it
    has determined the cause of the exception.  The important point here is
    that the error is passed to the task whose FP registers were being
    saved.  When OS_GenerateError is called, the supervisor stack is cleared
    out, so it is as though the Wimp_Poll call never happened.  Note that
    the error number here has the top bit set, which indicates to the error
    handler that execution cannot be resumed after the PC address where the
    error occurred.

Changes applying to Wimp 2.86 and above
----------------------------------------

    Tasks knowing about Wimp 2.86 or later have to provide an extra argument
to Wimp_Initialise.

     Wimp_Initialise now becomes:
            R0 = latest known version of Wimp * 100 (300)
            R1 = "TASK"
            R2 -> task name string
            R3 -> A list of message numbers terminated by a 0 word.

     The task will only receive messages which are included in the list. 
the list should not (and cannot) include Message_Quit (0) as this message
will always be delivered to all tasks.

Documentation that relates to Wimp 2.00 as well
-----------------------------------------------

Update of writeable icons:

    If an application wishes to update the contents of a writeable icon
    directly, while the caret is inside the icon, then it cannot in general
    simply write to the icon's indirected buffer and make sure it gets
    redrawn.

    The general routine goes as follows:

        REM In: window% = window handle of icon to be updated
        REM     icon%   = icon handle of icon to be updated
        REM     buffer% = address of indirected icon text buffer
        REM     string$ = new string to put into icon

        DEF PROCwrite_icon(window%,icon%,buffer%,string$)
        LOCAL cw%,ci%,cx%,cy%,ch%,ci%
        $buffer% = string$
        SYS "Wimp_GetCaretPosition" TO cw%,ci%,cx%,cy%,ch%,ci%
        IF cw%=window% AND ci%=icon% THEN
          IF ci% > LEN($buffer%) THEN ci% = LEN($buffer%)
          SYS "Wimp_SetCaretPosition",cw%,ci%,cx%,cy%,-1,ci%
        ENDIF
        PROCseticonstate(window%,icon%,0,0)   :REM redraw the icon
        ENDPROC

    Basically if the length of the string changes, it is possible for the
    caret to be positioned off the end of the string, in which case nasty
    effects can occur (especially if you delete the string terminator!).


Deleting and creating icons:

    Using Wimp_CreateIcon and Wimp_DeleteIcon to create and delete icons has
    certain disadvantages: the window is not redrawn, and the icon handles
    can change.

    An alternative is to use Wimp_SetIconState to set and clear the icon's
    'deleted' bit (bit 23).

    However, it should be noted that when calling Wimp_SetIconState to set
    bit 23 of the icon flags (ie. to delete it), the icon will not be
    'undrawn' unless bit 7 of the icon flags ('needs help to be redrawn') is
    also set.  This is because icons without this bit set are simply redrawn
    on top of their old selves without filling in the background, to avoid
    flicker.

    Thus to delete an icon, use:

        block%!0 = window_handle%
        block%!4 = icon_handle%
        block%!8 = &00800080              :REM set
        block%!12= &00800080              :REM bits 7 and 23
        SYS "Wimp_SetIconState",,block%

    and to re-create it, use:

        block%!0 = window_handle%
        block%!4 = icon_handle%
        block%!8 = &00000000              :REM clear
        block%!12= &00800080              :REM bits 7 and 23
        SYS "Wimp_SetIconState",,block%

    Note that when re-creating the icon, bit 7 should normally be cleared,
    to avoid flicker when updating the icon.
