The FilerSWIs module provides a small number of SWIs to help with the
starting of Filer action windows. They take the information, packages it up
as messages then sends them.

The SWIs provided are:
FilerAction_SendSelectedDirectory
FilerAction_SendSelectedFile
FilerAction_SendStartOperation

To start a given action, after the "*WimpTask Filer_Action", first issue a
SendSelectedDirectory to specify the source directory - the one with the
selection of files within it. Next issue several SendSelectedFile SWIs to
specify which files are selected. Lastly to start the action issue a
SendStartOperation.



FilerAction_SendSelectedDirectory (&40f80)

In
r0 = task handle to send the message to
r1 = pointer to nul terminated directory name



FilerAction_SendSelectedFile (&40f81)

In
r0 = task handle to send the message to
r1 = Points to nul terminated directory name



FilerAction_SendStartOperation (&40f82)

In
r0 = task handle to send the message to
r1 = Operation ID to start:
     0    Copy
     1    Move (rename)
     2    Delete
     3    Set access
     4    Set type
     5    Count
     6    Move (by copying and deleting afterwards)
     7    Copy local (within directory)
     8    Stamp files
     9    Find file
r2 = Option bits:
     bit  meaning
     0    Verbose
     1    Confirm
     2    Force
     3    Newer (a opposed to just Look)
     4    Recurse (only applies to access)
r3 = Points to operation specific data:
r4 = Length of operation specific data:
     Copy:
     r3   points to nul terminated name of destination directory
     r4   strlen( r3 ) + 1

     Move:
     r3   points to nul terminated name of destination directory
     r4   strlen( r3 ) + 1

     Delete:
     r3   unused
     r4   0
     
     Set access:
     r3   Points to word containing required new access:
           bottom two bytes indicate the values to set when setting the values
           top two bytes flag which bits are to be left alone
     r4   sizeof( int )

     Set type:
     r3   Points to word containing new type in bits 0-11
     r4   sizeof( int )

     Count:
     r3   unused
     r4   0

     Copy Move
     r3   points to nul terminated name of destination directory
     r4   strlen( r3 ) + 1

     Copy Local
     r3   points to nul terminated destination name
     r4   strlen( r3 ) + 1

     Stamp
     r3   unused
     r4   0

     Find
     r3   points to null terminated name of object to find
     r4   strlen( rs ) + 1
