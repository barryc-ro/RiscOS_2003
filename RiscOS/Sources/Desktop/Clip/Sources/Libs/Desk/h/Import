This function-type should load data from the file specified in 'data'.

'reference' is the reference originally passed to
Desk_Import_RegisterFileLoader.

		Desk_icon_handle		icon, 
		void			*reference
		);
/*
This registers an internal function (using Desk_Event_Claim) which is called
whenver a file is dropped onto window-icon, and does all the
Desk_Wimp_SendMessage stuff involved in the wimp file transfer protocol.

'ramfn' is ignored at the moment - use NULL. Eventuall the Import
library will support ram-transfer.

You supply a function 'fn' which will be called to do the actual file-loading, 
using the information in the Desk_message_dataload structure.
'fn' will also be given 'reference' as passed in the original call to 
Desk_Import_RegisterFileLoader, which can be used to give extra information.

NB Desk_message_dataload is defined in DeskLib:Wimp.h and has the following
fields:
	Desk_window_handle window;
	Desk_icon_handle   icon;
	Desk_wimp_point    pos;
	int           estsize;
	int           filetype;
	char          filename[212];
	
The window, icon and pos are the mouse info for where the file was dropped.
filetype and filename are as given by whoever is giving us the file.

'fn' should *not* call Desk_Wimp_Poll, as it is called in the middle of
the file-transfer protocol.
