This module is a moduletask that supports the parts of the clipboard
protocol described in funcspec.html

It supports RAM and file transfer for both importing and exporting data.

Note that Sources/Libs is unused and should be empty - the module uses
the libraries in the RISC OS source tree, but local copies of some
library code were used initially before the libraries were added to the
RISC OS source tree.
