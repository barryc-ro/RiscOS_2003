;                      to re-incorporate the parallel change.
;                      Shift-EXT-close leaves child open, and opens parent.
;                      Drag to icon bar, but not to an icon, does a
;                      Data_Open on all but directories.

;                      Problem was that dvr_rhsgap, the gap at the right of
;                      directory viewers was not handled correctly when
;                      calculating number of columns of icons. Also, columns
;                      in dirviewers not zeroed, which avoids fitting window
;                      to columns. Add dvr_rhsslack to give a bit of slack
;                      before reshape when user narrows window.

;                      named db_fpr_... added for special meaning values

;                      specify where, how big and viewmode on command line.

;                      Add routine is_copy_recursive to disable recursive copying or moving
;                      Make sure first letters of menu entries are capital
;                      Separate handling of *filer_closedir after having extended
;                          *filer_opendir for the open at functionality
;                      Add stamp option
;                      Downgrade the reopen severity after a recache to a reshape.
