To Do:
------

Document in WkspEtc that d_dirname, d_special and d_stripname are the canonical forms held with the dirblock and d_dirnamestore is the window title.
DelViews should determine chilness when deleting dir and all its children by d_dirname and not d_dirnamestore.
DragEnd should check for recursive copying based on d_dirname (the canonical dirname) and not d_dirnamestore (the window title).
OpenDir should check for already existance based on d_dirname and not d_dirnamestore
strip now redundent code from UpCall handling as now have canonical forms to hand
5026 Useless error message
5035 Background filer functions are too slow for some cases
5069 daft error message from filer
5074 Filer should not close parent directory viewer if error occurs
5097 filer window update failing
5098 more update failure - can't see new files created outside desktop
5109 Copy 'Confirm' option STILL not
5112 Filer could usefully recache more often.
