Asynchronous thoughts:

This table indicates (with a .) which operations end at different answers if
they go off asynchronously, rather than being ordered.

  a  cs cd d  f  ms md n  s  t
a .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .     
cs.     .  .     .  .     .  .
cd.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
d .  .  .     .  .  .  .     
f .     .  .     .  .     
ms.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
md.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

s    .  .        .  .     
t    .  .        .  .     

This table is not hard to implement in the Filer - it would take about two
weeks.

Semantics
---------

Easy/obvious:
User selects items, sets the access on them then copies/deletes them.

Hard/unobvious:
User selects items, moves them from (a) to (b), then moves them from (a) to (c).
Does the user mean 'move whatever is left to (c)' or 'move those I can see to (c)'.

Visuals
-------

Easy (but irritating):
Put up an error box when an operation is to be deleyed.

Less irritating:
Put up the action window with a waiting message which starts going when the
action window it's waiting for finishes.

Also:
Grey out items which have been deleted, but aren't gone yet! disable
anything but open directory on them.
