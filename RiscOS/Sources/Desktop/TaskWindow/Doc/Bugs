Extant:

    *   If you Kill tasks which were started via the *TaskWindow command,
        they sometimes carry on executing and all the output is printed
        in VDU 5 mode at the bottom of the screen (when unlinked?).

    *   Sometimes when you Kill a task using the !Edit menu, a Wimp error
        box with "Escape" in it appears.

    *   Width is incorrect for things like *Cat - OS_ReadVduVariables should
        be patched so that WindowWidth returns an appropriate number for
        !Edit (ie. the screen width minus a bit).  This problem is more
        acute when double-clicking on TaskObey files, as the window width is
        taken to be the size of the icon double-clicked!

    *   If you start the maximum number of tasks, then any tasks which
        subsequent need a task window will not be able to get one, because
        the process of getting a task window involves starting another task
        which simply sets up the parenttask handles of the waiting task. 
        Unfortunately this task can't start cos they're all used up, so you
        get a "Too many tasks" error from !Edit, and then a "You need !Edit
        loaded to get a task window" from the task that couldn't get a task
        window.

    *   If you do a TaskInput to a task that has been killed, then reconnect
        the task, you can't type anything at it.

    *   !Edit title bar should show the name of the task.

    *   TaskWindow message protocol is baroque - should use the TIP protocol.

    *   Errors when closing taskwindow (eg. "Channel" when closing
        redirection files) should be ignored.

    *   Error message when taskwindow can't be created cos !Edit runs out of
        room is misleading - rephrase.

    *   AMU ignores errors in TaskWindow - makes it difficult to kill the
        task.

    *   Stop spooling etc. on Service_WimpReportError.

    *   Close Exec file properly when task is closed down, eg:
            *TaskWindow "Exec foo" -quit

    *   *Copy with pipes gives address exception - Wimp memory claimed but
        moves around?

    *   If you put the taskwindow module inside !Edit as instructed in
        !RelNote, the module doesn't get loaded until you open a task window
        using !Edit, so any *TaskWindow commands issued will fail until this
        is done.

Fixed:

    *   Alias for TaskExec files is incorrect - should say "-display"
        instead of "-quit".

    *   Allow *TaskWindow xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx to specify a command to execute
        as well, so a text window can connect to a task explicitly.

    *   If !Edit is not loaded, but the taskwindow module is, and you issue
        a *TaskWindow command that causes screen output, the program will
        not report an error message "!Edit is not loaded", but will simply
        wait until !Edit is loaded, and if you then open a task window using
        !Edit, the task will spring to life in it.  However, by then the
        variable <Obey$Dir> will have been corrupted, so the task will
        probably fail.

    *   Tasks started via a *TaskWindow command have escape disabled.  If
        you go "*FX229,0" inside the task, this works if you have already
        got an Edit window, but not otherwise.

    *   When killing a task in SVC mode that just prints characters (eg.
        *Help), the window dies but the output continues, because no error
        is returned from OS_WriteC and no callback can get in until the task
        returns to USR mode.

    *   Sometimes the assembler crashes in the task window.  This seems to
        happen outside the task window as well, so it may not be a task
        window problem  -  This seems to be a symptom of the nested callback
        handler incorrect workspace bug.
