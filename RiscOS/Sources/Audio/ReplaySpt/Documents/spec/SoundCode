Replay_SoundCode has a tenth reason code, previously undocumented:

Init sound file (10)

  On entry:
    R1 -> sound code info block (as with all other reason codes, must be
          embedded within a soundcode context block)
    R2 = the SoundFile module's ID for this file
    R3 = bufsize
    R4 = rate adjust (the value by which the sample rate read from the
         SoundFile format block must be multiplied in order to give a
         sample rate in units of 2^-20 Hz)

This is now joined by a related eleventh reason code:

Init sound file with specified attenuation (11)

  On entry:
    R1 -> sound code info block (as with all other reason codes, must be
          embedded within a soundcode context block)
    R2 = the SoundFile module's ID for this file
    R3 = bufsize
    R4 = rate adjust (the value by which the sample rate read from the
         SoundFile format block must be multiplied in order to give a
         sample rate in units of 2^-20 Hz)
    R5 = attenuation to apply compared to system volume, in units of
         0.376 dB (so an increase of 16 will halve amplitude)
