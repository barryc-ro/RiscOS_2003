The callback hack deserves some discussion. In the old model:

  * foreground task fills Buffer Manager buffer via Fileswitch & DeviceFS.
  * SharedSound calls SoundFS using transient callbacks.
  * SoundFS processes data from BufferManager buffer into SharedSound buffer
    on these callbacks.
  * Transient callbacks are called when RISC OS is idle and when the OS
    is being threaded out.
  * When the file is closed DeviceFS first checks with BufferManager is
    the data has been exhasuted.
  * If the data has not been exhausted it simply loops round and asks again.
  * Meanwhile the OS is not threaded out, and it's DeviceFS, not RISC OS, which
    is idle. No callbacks go off.

Fortunately DeviceFS has a virtually undocumented MonitorTX call, which will
be made to a driver when a wake up for TX call is made without effect. A
slight hack which threads out the OS when this happens has been introduced to
SoundFS.
