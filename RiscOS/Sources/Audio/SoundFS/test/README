To use AudioDeviceDriver you need the following :

DeviceFS      0.44
FileSwitch    2.37
SharedSound   0.48
BufferManager 0.26

Note that at the time of writing it wouldn't work under Ursula (with
FileSwitch 2.41), with OS_Find open on the audio stream causing a
data abort. This problem will hopefully be fixed in the next merge
from Ursula back to the trunk.
