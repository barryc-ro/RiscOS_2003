SoundFX requires the following modules to be loaded:

        SoundFile
        ReplaySupport
        SoundFileExtMSADPCM
        FilePlay
        SharedSound

Sources for these can be found in the source tree.

!FPRun is a framework for loading these modules (except the SharedSound
module which may be required by Replay).
