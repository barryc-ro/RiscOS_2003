<h2> <a name="overview"> Overview </a> </h2>

<P>There are many different types of sound file formats in existence
however they are generally very similar in structure.

<P>This module provides an extensible method for accessing these files.

<HR><! -------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2> <a name="technical"> Technical background </a> </h2>

<P>SoundFile is a module designed to make it easy for any application to
read and decode foreign sound file types. It provides SWIs to open and
decode the type of a file and translation code to convert from various
data formats to 16 bit linear.

<P>The system is easily extensible. The SoundFile module will provide
support for a few core file types and data formats. Other types can be
provided for transparently by use of SoundFileExtension modules. These
communicate with the main module via Service calls and function
pointers.

<P>Note SoundFile doesn't do any playback itself, it just provides
detection and translation services, it is up to the application
(possibly using the <A HREF="replaysupport.html">ReplaySupport</A>
module) to feed the data to an output device.

<HR><! -------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2> <a name="user"> User interface </a> </h2>

<P>SoundFile provides two commands for general use.

<H3>SoundFileInfo &lt;filename&gt;</H3>

<P>Scans and identifies the file format and prints out information on
it. The information given may vary from version to version and shouldn't
be relied upon to occur in any particular format.       

<H3>SoundFileForceClose</H3>

<P>Normally the SoundFile module will refuse to die if it thinks it
still has any files open. This call forces all sound files closed. It
should be used with extreme care.

<HR><! -------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2> <a name="programmer"> Programmer interface </a> </h2>

<P>On entry, R0 always holds a flags word.

<P>On exit, if V is set then R0 points to a standard error block. If V
is clear then R0 will be corrupted.

<P>All registers not specifically mentioned will be preserved.

<H3><A NAME="swi_open">SoundFile_Open (0x4AEC0)</A></H3>

<P>Open a file and identify it. If the file format cannot be identified
(but no other error is given) then as much information as possible will
be filled in.

the other SWI's are used.

holds internally.

        R0 -> lookup table within SoundFile, or 0
</PRE>
<H5>Notes</H5>

<P>The format code is as returned in the format block in the word at +12.
<P>Not all formats have a lookup table, for those that don't, r0 = 0.

<P>Those currently returning pointers are as follows:
<UL>
<LI>Type 1 (8 Bit VIDC)
<LI>Type 2 (8 Bit u-Law)
<LI>Type 3 (8 Bit A-Law)
</UL>

<P>They each return a pointer to a 512 byte table. This is a table of
256 half words mapping the encoded sample value to a 16 bit signed
linear value.


<HR><! -------------------------------------------------------------------->
<H3>SoundFileExtension modules</H3>

<P>A SoundFileExtension module just needs to implement a service call
handler to look for <A
HREF="#service_identify">Service_IdentifySoundFile</A>  and respond if
it can. It should store all the information necessary to access the file
in the buffer pointed to by R5. If it needs to allocate extra space for
more info it can do this, and should store the pointer to this info in
the buffer. When it is called via its dispose handler it should free any
extra space it allocated.

<H4>SoundFileExtension handlers</H4>

<P>This handler is called directly from the SoundFile module when
necessary.

</PRE>

<P>AIFC is an extended version of AIFF supporting compressed formats.
Unfortunately information on the compression algorithms is difficult to
find.

<P>Wave supports many different compression formats. There seem to be as
many different compression formats as there are PC manufacturers, some
of which are proprietary. Therefore we will stick to the simple ones
unless formats appear to be important. One case that is important is
Microsoft ADPCM (type 2) as it is used in a number of key CDROMs.

<P>Only the uncompressed Iota samples are supported.

<P>There are many sub types of AU. Only 8 and 16 bit are supported.

<h2> <a name="interchange"> Data interchange </a> </h2>

<H3><A NAME="service_identify">Service_IdentifySoundFile</A> (0x80380)</H3>

<P>Identify the type of sound file or supply special routines for an
already identified type. The bottom byte of R0 gives a reason code
describing what is needed.

<P>If the reason code is 0 then the file has not been identified at all,
R4 points to the first 1024 bytes of the file and all information in the
SoundFileInfo structure pointed to by R5 should be filled in.

<P>If the reason code is 1 then the file has been identified as a
Microsoft Wave file, however the format code is not supported by the
SoundFile module. In this case R4 points to the description structure
for this format (or the first 1024 bytes of it) and the format
independent information will have already been entered into the
SoundFileInfo structure.

type of compression format then it should ignore all .WAVs of other
formats so that another module gets the chance to handle them.

<P>The Extension module is free to store whatever it wishes in the the
Format specific data area. This includes pointers to  other pieces of
allocated memory. In this case ensure that bit 2 is set so that the
