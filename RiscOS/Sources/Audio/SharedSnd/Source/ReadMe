SharedSound module
------------------

This module was written and generally maintained by Andy Pierson of
Expressive Software Projects 'andy@exsoftpr.demon.co.uk'.

The module is built by running the main BASIC program 'SharedSoun' which
loads additional BASIC libraries, assembles the code and saves out the
resulting module. This original distribution is in the Source directory.

To make best use of the CVS revision control the module is build here in a
different way. The files are all stored as text files in the 'c' directory
and are then transferred to the 'o' directoru whilst being converted to BASIC
programs when building.

So to build the module just 'make rom'.

To import new code do the following.

 1) Copy the new files in the Source directory.
 2) Copy all the BASIC programs (SharedSound and SSLib.*) into the 'o'
    directory
 2) Do 'amu import' (MkImport) which will copy all the files into the 'c'
    directory.
 3) So 'amu clean' (MkClean) to clear the 'o' directory.
 4) If there are any new source files add them into the makefile.
 5) Edit c.SharedSoun to change the LIBRARY definitions to point to the
    files in the 'o' directory.
 6) Checkin the changes to CVS.
