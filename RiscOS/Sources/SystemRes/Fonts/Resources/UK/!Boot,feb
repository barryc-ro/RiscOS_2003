| Boot file for !Fonts.
| Nothing happens if you put this in a RISC OS 2 machine except that
| the !Fonts sprite is set up - this means that, when a RISC OS 2 !Fonts
| directory is seen the !Boot file will not be run; double clicking on the
| appropriate !Fonts will force installation.
|
| Take care when merging RISC OS 2 fonts with these (RISC OS 3) fonts -
| many fonts are contained in the RISC OS 3 ROM and thus do not appear in
| !Fonts; normally you should not copy the corresponding RISC OS 2 fonts!
