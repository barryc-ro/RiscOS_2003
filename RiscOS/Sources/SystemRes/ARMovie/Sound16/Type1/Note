These sources aren't quite the same as the vanilla ESP 0.88 (29 Nov 1996)
version - I've hacked around with the source a little bit to get it to build
binary identical versions of the most recent known type-1 16-bit codecs
(except for a couple of uninitialised locations at the end of EQUSs). I've
not tried to interpret what the changes achieve, so the reconsituted source
isn't commented.

The latest known binary version of the type-2 adpcm codec hasn't got the
changes that the type-1 codecs received. However, in the latest known binary
version, the adpcm decompression code itself (at adpcm%) appears to have
been completely rewritten - but I can't find any source for that. So
instead, I have tried to make it as far as possible that the code here
builds a vanilla 0.88 adpcm codec instead. The vanilla 0.88 adpcm codec can
be found in binary form on the Skynet NFS mount, in the root !ARMovie and in
the "ForCharles" directory.

Note that the version of ARMovie included on NCs and STBs via the MultiMedia
module doesn't include an adpcm codec, so there are no issues with
regressing their software.
