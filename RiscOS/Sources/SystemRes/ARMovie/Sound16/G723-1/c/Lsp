**
** Function:            AtoLsp()
**
** Description:     Transforms 10 LPC coefficients to the 10
**          corresponding LSP frequencies for a subframe.
**          This transformation is done once per frame,
**          for subframe 3 only.  The transform algorithm
**          generates sum and difference polynomials from
**          the LPC coefficients.  It then evaluates the
**          sum and difference polynomials at uniform
**          intervals of pi/256 along the unit circle.
**          Intervals where a sign change occurs are
**          interpolated to find the zeros of the
**          polynomials, which are the LSP frequencies.
