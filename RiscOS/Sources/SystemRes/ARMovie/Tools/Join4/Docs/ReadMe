Features Added to Join
----------------------

-Index N	Finally added (21/10/97)

-Subsample N	When using normal sound file input, subsamples by N (21/10/97)

		Automatic subsampling of ARMovie sound source files with the
		incorrect replay rate (22/10/97)

		Bugfixes! Subsamples stereo sound properly (23/10/97)

11 Nov 1997	Just fiddled one subsample Warning: that appeared a little to
		happily.

18 Nov		Fixed minor flaw in compressed sound size calculation that
		occurs occasioanlly (GSM, sometimes, occasionally!)

5 Dec		Fixed multiple sound track operation which was seriously broken.
		Now deletes Join$ExtraArgs after use (old join never did this,
		but I was getting far too confused when testing!).
		Accurate -help

7 Jan 1998	If there are images, the datestamp of the output ARMovie file
		is set to that of the first iamge chunk.

9 Jan		Copes with new type 2 sound compressors (specifically MPEG)
		and their extra parameter strings. (I've got docs about this
		here).

		Currently needs at least 4Mb free because I've required this
		for an increadibly large stack! (I'll reduce this soon...)

		MPEG codecs work, but are not particularly stable.
		The play code is downright dangerous.

13 Jan		Removed the massive stack requirements.

15 Jan		Fixed clicks at end of type 2 sound tracks, now a .25 MB stack
		space.

27 Jan		Caching of variable ratio compressed type 2 sound data to
		half compression time.

28 Jan		Cache is put in Wimp$ScrapDir if it exists.
		Caching fixed!
