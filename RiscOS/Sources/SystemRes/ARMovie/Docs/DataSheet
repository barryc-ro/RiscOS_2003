           Overview to Replay III
           ----------------------

Replay III is a multitasking audio and video player (audio only multitasks on
16 bit sound systems) for RISC OS. It supports a large number of capabilities:

Data:

data can be contained in RISC OS file system files (or things to which RISC OS
has access like NFS) and read from them incrementally (you don't need the whole
file in RAM in the machine to play it!) in a variety of formats (extensible).
We have Acorn's own "ARMovie" format, Apple's QuickTime MOV format and
Microsoft's AVI format, plus minor formats like QuickTime VR, AIFF, ANIM, DL,
FLI, FLC, VOC, WAV and WVE. We have an open license for NCs for AVI and MOV and
a restricted one for desktop sales (AVI/IV32 only). In addition, data may be
fetched from a RealAudio 3 streaming server and from various real time devices
such as digitisers and videophones.

Video:

Lots of compressors and decompressors, many of which are ours, but many need a
license, which has been done for NC space for many of the 6xx codecs.

Of these, formats 9,10,11,21,22,23,24,25 are all trivially real time (and many
are used in ARMovie acquisition systems)(they are quite high bit rate, though!)
and format 18 (h263) is real time on fast enough machines (1500 macroblocks per
second (176x144x15fps) on a 233MHz SA110).

Paint code:

Replay can support most possible screen modes and pixel shapes (or this can be
used to magnify the image). Interpolation or dithering is supported on more
capable systems when magnifying.

As well as the committed vertical scale factors above, Replay is also capable
of supporting (somewhat less efficiently) arbitrary vertical scaling without
interpolation vertically.

In addition, Replay can support real time distortion of the picture to follow
"shapes" and "trajectories". This does not multi-task, nor does it support all
the paint capabilities above.

Colour space support for:

8 bit colour indexed                 (RGB8)
14 bit Ultimotion colour (4UV6Y)     (ULTI16)
15 bit RGB colour                    (RGB16)
15 bit YUV colour                    (YUV16)
15 bit CCIR YUV colour               (CYUV16)
16 bit 6Y5UV colour                  (6Y5UV16)
16 bit CCIR 6Y5UV colour             (C6Y5UV16)
16 bit CCIR 6Y5CC colour             (6Y5CC16)
18 bit 6Y6UV colour                  (6Y6UV16)
18 bit CCIR 6Y6UV colour             (6Y6UV16)
24 bit YUV colour                    (YUV24, 6Y5UV24, 6Y6UV24)
24 bit CCIR YUV colour               (CYUV24, C6Y5UV24, C6Y6UV24)
24 bit CCIR YCC colour               (YCC24, 6Y5CC24)

In the above, UV refers to colour subcarrier data which is sign extended and CC
refers to components which are excess 128.
