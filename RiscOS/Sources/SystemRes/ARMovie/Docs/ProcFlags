Processor flags in Replay and related APIs
==========================================

BASIC
-----
CALL, USR:
  only the V flag is examined by BASIC on exit, an error is thrown if it is set

SoundDMA
--------
Sound_LinearHandler 1:
  linear handler routine exit flags are ignored

SharedSound
-----------
SharedSound_InstallHandler:
  handler routine exit flags are ignored
SharedSound_InstallDriver:
  driver routine exit flags are ignored, irrespective of reason code

CBAI
----
CBAI_RegisterPollWord:
  callback routine exit flags are ignored

SoundFile
---------
Service_IdentifySoundFile:
  the routines filled into the SoundFile_Format block by the service call
  claimant (LoadData, To16, Dispose) have a common flags interface: on exit,
  only the V flag is examined (if set, the error pointer in R0 is passed out
  the the caller of the relevent SoundFile SWI).

Sound codecs
------------
Entry point +0 (sndplay/arplayfn):
  Called from ARLib, FilePlay and SoundPlay, which assume APCS compatibility,
  and from Player
Entry point +4 (sndstop/arstopfn):
  Called from ARLib, FilePlay and SoundPlay, which assume APCS compatibility,
  and from Player
Entry point +8 (snddata/ardatafn):
  Called from ARLib, FilePlay, ReplaySupport and SoundPlay, which assume APCS
  compatibility, and from Player
From v0.58 (29 Jan 2001), Player calls all entry points from SVC mode and
ignores exit flags - previously it sometimes CALLed them directly which (a) has
conflicting exit conditions with APCS-R, and (b) called them in USR mode which
prevents interrupt disabling using TEQP/MSR from working. The most restrictive
conditions are those imposed by the APCS in use, so at least R4-R11 must be
preserved. In 26-bit mode, the flags from R14 on entry should be current on
exit, since there is no way to know whether APCR-R or APCS-32 is in use. In
32-bit mode, APCS-32 will be in use, so exit flags need have no particular
setting.

Player
------
-mouse:
  mouse handler routine exit flags are ignored
-paint:
  time bar paint handler routine exit flags are ignored
