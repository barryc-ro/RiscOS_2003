			PNA module interface
			


PNA_Prepare
-----------

This call warns the PNA module that a connection to a given URL is probably
about to be requested. The PNA module will start a background connection to
that URL and pull back enough information for an ARMovie header to be faked
for that file.  The state of the the connection may be monitored via the
returned handle (see PNA_State).

The PNA module will also speculatively stream data from the URL.

On Entry:
	R0=Pointer to null terminated URL

On Exit:
	R0=Unique connection handle

Use:

The purpose of this SWI is to allow a preloader application to warm up a
connection while preserving the machine's responsiveness to the user, so that
when the stream is eventually played, a call to PNA_Open for the same URL
will return immediately.

Two attempts to 'prepare' the same URL will result in 2 different
connection handles.

Warmed up connections time out after a period of ten seconds, after which
passing them to any of the SWIs below will lead to an error being returned.



PNA_Open
--------

This call opens a connection to a URL if one does not exist already, or
picks up on a previously 'prepare'd one that is not currently open.

If this call picks up on a prepared connection which has been polled and
reported as connected, (or one that has previously been opened and
closed but not fetched from) then this call will return instantly.
Otherwise it will block until the connection has been sucessfully made.

On entry:
	R0=Pointer to null terminated URL

On exit:
	R0=Connection handle

Use:

Within the current system, this SWI is called by the recogniser (the module
MFSRA) when requested by MovieFS to fake an ARMovie file header.



PNA_Close
---------

Called on the close of the image file containing the faked ARMovie. This
releases any claim the owner of the handle has on the connection, but does
not necessarily close the connection to the remote host.

On Entry:
	R0=Connection handle

On Exit:
	R0 preserved



PNA_Destroy
-----------

Release a connection and close it releasing all associated resources.

On Entry:
	R0=Connection handle

On Exit:
	R0 preserved

Called form the Close entry point of the RealAudio fetcher.



PNA_State
---------

Returns the state of an open or warming up connection.

On Entry:
	R0=Connection handle

On Exit:
	R0=state

Valid states are:

	1	Resolving server address
	2	Waiting for connection
	3	Waiting for proxy info
	4	Greeting server
	5	Verifying server
	6	Requesting resource
	7	Ready for playback
	8	Closing connection
	9	Successful completion
	10	Connection failed

States returned from any single connection handle will move down the list
with time.  Handles returned from PNA_Open will yield states in the range
"Ready for playback" or below.



PNA_Error
---------

If a connection handle is in the "Connection failed" state then the reason
for failure can be discovered by calling PNA_Error.  In that case this SWI
will also fail with a corresponding error.  If the connection hasn't failed
then PNA_Error does nothing.

On Entry:
	R0=Connection handle

On Exit:
	R0 preserved



PNA_Info
--------

This call returns the information on a given file needed to fake an
ARMove header.  R0-R2 become valid only when the connection is in the ready
state.

On entry:
	R0=Connection handle

On exit:
	R0=Pointer to info block (see below for format)
	R1=Size of .ra file header
	R2=Pointer to .ra file header
	R3=Server address
	R4=Resource path
	

Called by a recogniser to get the information required to fake an ARMovie
file.  Only R0 is used in the current system.  R1 and R2 are provided so that
a stream can be saved locally as a .ra file.  R3 and R4 are for user feedback

PNA_Fetch
---------

Called by the fetcher's Fetch routine. This returns a list of data if there
is enough to be worthwhile, returns a postpone code if there is not enough,
and returns an error code if the connection dropped.


On Entry:
	R0=Connection handle
	R1=Chunk number

On Exit:
	R1=Pointer to list of sound data in the same format as passed
	
	R1-> 0 Number of buffers
	     4 Address of buffer 1
	     8 Size of buffer 1
	    12 Address of buffer 2
	    16 Size of buffer 2
	            .
	            .
	            .

Number of buffer =  0	means postpone
                   -1	means error
