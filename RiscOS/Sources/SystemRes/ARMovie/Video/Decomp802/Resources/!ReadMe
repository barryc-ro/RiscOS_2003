 Movie 16:3
 ==========

 'Movie 16:3' is a Replay compressor for 'real-world' frames, guaranteed to
compress at least 16:3 (to 18% of the size of the uncompressed frame in 15bpp
RGB).
 The compressor does not at all like computer generated graphics, eg. output
from raytracers and modelling programs.


 Compressor
 ----------
 The compressor is compatible with other Replay compressors and Replay
compressor frontends, eg. !AREncode or !RCompress, but can also be used on its
own from the CLI.


 Install
 -------
 Simply copy the Decomp802 directory to your !ARMovie directory. On a Risc PC,
this is stored inside the directory !Boot.Resources.


 How to compress from the CLI
 ----------------------------
 The Comp802 program converts any Replay file to the Movie 16:3 format:


 *<ARMovie$Dir>.Decomp802.Comp802 [options] <infile> <outfile>


 Options are
 -display    - display in MODE 28.
 -keys       - allow playback to be started at the start of any chunk.
 -area n     - n can be 0, 1, 2 or 3. Larger number gives better quality and
               smaller files, but compression is much slower. Default is 1.

 infile      - can be any Replay file which includes video.
 outfile     - the output file.

 If <infile> is in YUV format, Comp802 will require access to the file
'<ARMovie$Dir>.MovingLine.16yuv'.
 If the -display option is set, Comp802 will require access to the files
'<ARMovie$Dir>.MovingLine.8rgb11' and '<ARMovie$Dir>.MovingLine.8rgb22'.


 How to compress using a Replay compressor frontend
 --------------------------------------------------
 The compressor will appear with the other compressors and can be selected
just like those.
 NOTICE: The compressor ignores the settings of framesize/quality/data rate
which can be specified in most Replay compressor frontends. It simply
compresses as much as it can.
 If you've set the 'Make keys' option, you should delete the keys after
compression. If this option is set, the compressor will use a special
compression scheme for the first frame in each chunk, and thus the keys are
not needed and will only take up a lot of space.

 ---------------------------

 Unfortunately, Acorn don't provide much support for PublicDomain
programmers. I've asked twice for an 'official' Replay compression type
number; first time I never got any answer so I tried again (4 months later)
and this time I was asked to email them my postal address, but 4 weeks later I
still hadn't heard anything.
 In a previous version of this file, I said some not at all nice things
about Acorn. Since then, they've complained to Oregan Software Development
about this. I have written several commercial applications for Oregan, so
I guess Acorn thought Oregan were to blame, in one way or another.
 However, this program has NOTHING to do with Oregan; it is a Public Domain
program, written by me alone and released by me alone.
 I've been told that Acorn cannot allocate filetypes, SWI chunk numbers,
Replay compressor numbers etc. to all the Public Domain programmers who
want this, and I can understand that. But I don't like being fooled to believe
that they WILL allocate a Replay compression number for me, and then never
hear from them again.

 Anyway, I've picked the number 802 at random, which effectively means that
this compressor is useless!! I have also written compressors which use the
numbers 800, 801 and 803; what happens when Acorn allocate these numbers
to a commercial Replay compressor?

 Replay allows 9999 different compressors. Why can't Acorn allocate just
1000 or 2000 of these for PublicDomain, like they've done it with  filetypes
and SWI chunk numbers???
