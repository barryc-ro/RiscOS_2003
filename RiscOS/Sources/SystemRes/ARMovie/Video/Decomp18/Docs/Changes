entry.c & entry.h

	Renamed control.c entry.c and decomp.h entry.h; it makes sense. Added
	nice comments to make it understandable (by me, a bearer of very little
	brain). Took a superflous parameter (int *list) out of ShutEntry.
	
	Reformatted the code (how I like it since i'm looking at it, also
	helped me to work out what's going on).
	
	There's lots of Mod_Malloc that should be removed.

DISCLAIM.h

	Removed it since its not in the original distribution anyway
	and its only a file full of comments.

Global.h

	Left it as it is at the moment since there's a lot going on in there.
	It is an original file, but there are copious modifications.

Memory.h

	Created this from 3 separate headers involving memory;
	dy_malloc, mallarr and amemset64

s.veneer

	Put much of this veneer into the same file coalescing veener, entries
	dosetxy and nullcopy.
	
s.tryout & s.trout16

	Since I haven't a clue what these do, I've copied them across and
	hust put useful(?) comment headers on them

s.output

	Copied across with header

getbits.h

	put agetbits.h into it

mallarr.c

	removed a * from RJW's addition of get1array

tryout16

	Put in some comment breaks to separate macros (its hard enough to get
	my head around as it is without bad layout!). Commented out whole
	tryout file and still crashed in 24bpp multi modes!

	Tried 602 type movies, and they crash in the same circumstances...


	18 Sep 1997
	-----------
	
Player

	Sophie Wilson fixes the ARMovie:Player program, since it does something
	that the StrongARM doesn't like. (Duck for cover and don't mention the
	StrongARM!)
	
Bits left out of this version!

	There are a number of files that appear to be superflous. These are
	arecon.h fastidct.h
	HierProf.h profile.h (I have commented out the need for these, they
	                      may need to ve put back in)
	                     (P.S. Why copy the HierProf header???)
	testare.c testbits.c testdecomp.c testidct.c writeout.c
	getbits.c getblk.c getpic'.c reconold.c testdecom2.c
	
	recon.s reconold.s testven.s tryoutB.s tryout16B.s tryoutK.s
	tryout).s tryoutP.s
	
	Some of the .c files have been replaced by assembler equivalents.
	Some files are old versions not deleted (getpic'.c), or development
	versions (all those tryoutX.s).   I hope.
	
hdr.plook

	Moved this to s.plook.
	
	
	19 Sep 1997
	-----------

hdr.D

	Put all D definition files into one, with conditional statement
	selecting Decompressor type at top. Neater. No more file copying.

s.veneer

	Removed the 'iii' section which was not being used.


	24 Sep 1997
	-----------

s.tryoutFast

	New doframe function for FastDec24 that uses cunning additive colour
	lookup tables
