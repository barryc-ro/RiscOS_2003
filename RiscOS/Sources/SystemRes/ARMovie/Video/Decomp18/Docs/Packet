For a packet variant, link with entrypack.o and getpicpack.o instead of
entry.o and getpic.o. This will introduce a dependency on packet.h.

I'm not sure what difference a packet build makes; I don't have time to work
it out, and there's no documentation or even comments to explain it.

In the original build structure, complete sets of Dec files of both packet
and non-packet variants were built simultaneously.
