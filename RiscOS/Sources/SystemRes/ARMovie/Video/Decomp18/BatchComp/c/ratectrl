/* IMPORTANT NOTE:

   The H.263 standard does not specify a rate control method.  Each
   H.263 encoder has to implement a rate control suited for what the
   encoder is going to be used for. This software now includes two
   rate control methods: (i) the rate control from the TMN5 document,
   and (ii) the rate control method used to encode the H.263
   bitstreams submitted to the MPEG-4 tests. The default rate control
   is (i) which is suitable for low-delay teleconferencing. If the
   software is compiled with the OFFLINE_RATE_CONTROL flag, (ii) will
   be used. Read more about (ii) below.

   */
#include "Logger.h"
#include "sim.h"

#ifdef OFFLINE_RATE_CONTROL

/* ABOUT THE OFFLINE RATE CONTROL:

   If you compile the TMN encoder with OFFLINE_RATE_CONTROL, you will
   get the same rate control as was used to generate the MPEG-4
   anchors. This rate control does not skip any extra pictures after
   the first frame, and it uses a fixed frame rate. It is possible to
   start the rate control after a certain percentage of the sequence
   has been encoded with a fixed quantization parameter. Its purpose
   is to achieve the target bitrate as a mean bitrate for the whole
   sequence. In other words, it is a rate control method optimized for
   offline compression.

   If oyu use the offline rate control, you will risk not achieving
   the target rate under one or more of the following conditions :

   (i)   too high frame rate
   (ii)  too low start value for the quantization parameter
   (iii) the rate control is started too late
   (iv)  the sequence encoded is too short

*                  can be done at any macroblock if so desired.

*  Input: current macroblock number (raster scan), mean quantizer
*  paramter for previous picture, bit rate, source frame rate,
*  hor. number of macroblocks, vertical number of macroblocks, total #
*  of bits used until now in the current picture.
