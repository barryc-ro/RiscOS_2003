    This decompressor does not support the following ProgIf arguments:
    
    -follow
    -mode
    -mouse
    -paint
    -shape
    -small
    -track (irrelevant)
    
    nor the configuration variables
    
    ARMovie$PrefMode
    ARMovie$PrefBigMode
    ARMovie$Interpolate (interpolation is never done)
    ARMovie$Place (usage deprecated)
    ARMovie$Suffix (irrelevant)
    ARMovie$4Colour (always treated as present)

    However, it *does* support the 'fast forward' and 'slomo' buttons,
which MovingLines and friends currently do not.

    The -explode argument doesn't do quite the same thing as the
MovingLines one: it places in the given directory an IotaFilm file
(type &C2A) containing the film from the Replay file. This can be
edited using Image Animator or The Complete Animator.
