 LinePack
 ========

 'LinePack' is a Replay compressor, mainly for compressing computer generated
graphics (animations, raytracer-output etc).
 The compressor is LOSSLESS, and ignores the settings of frame-size,
compression quality or data rate which can be specified in most Replay
compressor frontends. It simply compresses as much as it can.


 Compressor
 ----------
 The compressor is compatible with other Replay compressors and Replay
compressor frontends, eg. !AREncode or !RCompress, but can also be used on its
own from the CLI.


 Install
 -------
 Simply copy the Decomp800 directory to your !ARMovie directory. On a Risc PC,
this is stored inside the directory !Boot.Resources.


 How to compress from the CLI
 ----------------------------
 The Comp800 program converts any Replay file to the Movie 16:3 format:


 *<ARMovie$Dir>.Decomp800.Comp800 [options] <infile> <outfile>


 Options are
 -display    - display in MODE 28.
 -keys       - allow playback to be started at the start of any chunk.

 infile      - can be any Replay file which includes video.
 outfile     - the output file.

 If <infile> is in YUV format, Comp800 will require access to the file
'<ARMovie$Dir>.MovingLine.16yuv'.
 If the -display option is set, Comp800 will require access to the files
'<ARMovie$Dir>.MovingLine.8rgb11' and '<ARMovie$Dir>.MovingLine.8rgb22'.


 How to compress using a Replay compressor frontend
 --------------------------------------------------
 The compressor will appear with the other compressors and can be selected
just like those.
 NOTICE: The compressor ignores the settings of framesize/quality/data rate
which can be specified in most Replay compressor frontends. It simply
compresses as much as it can.
 If you've set the 'Make keys' option, you should delete the keys after
compression. If this option is set, the compressor will use a special
compression scheme for the first frame in each chunk, and thus the keys are
not needed and will only take up a lot of space.


 Conditions of use
 =================

 'LinePack' is copyright (c) Henrik Bjerregaard Pedersen, 1995.

 The author cannot accept any liability for any damage or loss of any kind as
a result of the use of this program.

 You may use, copy, distribute this program freely as long as this file is
included unaltered and as long as you don't make any profit from it.
 PublicDomain libraries may charge a nominal fee to cover disc, postage etc.

 Decompressor (the files Decompress and Info):
 You may include the decompressor with PublicDomain/ShareWare/commercial
software as long as this file is included unaltered.

 Compressor (the files BatchComp, Comp800, Compress, Decompress and Info):
 If you want to included the compressor with a product of your own, please
contact me so that we can sort out the details.

 ---------------------------

 Please notice that the compression type numbers used by this compressor
and by my other Replay compressors are not allocated by Acorn, so at some
point, Acorn will find great pleasure in allocating these numbers to
a commercial developer, effectively rendering this compressor useless.

 Acorn cannot allocate Replay compression number (or filetypes or SWI chunk
number etc.) to every PublicDomain programmer who wants it, which I fully
understand. But at least they could allocate a few thousands of the 9999
available Replay compression number for PublicDomain, like they've done
with SWI numbers and filetypes.
 Instead, all the many hours I've spend writing my compressors are vasted;
if you intend to distibute the Replay movies you create without risking that
they collide with a commercial compressor, you should buy a commercially
available compressor (from Acorn!!!!!!) and use that. I could of course
change the compression number used by the my compressors, but that wouldn't
really change the fact that Acorn at any point could allocate that number
to someone else.
