This is version 2 of the MovieMagic Replay support code.

The contents of this directory are as follows:-

  !Run
  ----

Ensures needed versions of modules are loaded
Sets up MPEG$ExtraArgs variable and the MPEG run type. Note unlike 
ARMovie$ExtraArgs, MPEG$ExtraArgs is not cleared after each use.

This file should be run from the !ARMovie.!Boot file. eg add a line

/<Obey$Dir>.Decomp12.!Run

to the end of !ARMovie.!Boot.


  DitherExt
  SpriteExt
  ---------
  
CC modules to paint sprite onto screen from framestore at end of playback.
Only SpriteExt is loaded in the run file. DitherExt is loaded from the UI
if it is needed (in >8bpp modes). If SpriteExt is not found then OS_SpriteOp
will be used instead.

  Info
  ----
Codec info for ARPlayer and other applications.

  !RunImage
  ---------
  
This is called from !ARMovie.Player with the original command line. It does
some preprocessing on this command line (converting replay arguments to MPEG
arguments where possible and putting all unknown arguments into 
ARMovie$ExtraArgs) and then runs the original MPEG file. The run type for
which has been setup (by !Run) to call MCode21.!RunImage.

  MMagicUI
  --------
  
This is the user interface library for the MovieMagic card. It is loaded by
MCode21.!RunImage and handles communication with the controlling application.
It decodes the contents of ARMovie$ExtraArgs and ARMovie$Return (set by
the first !RunImage) and sets all necessary variables on exit.

  MCode21.MPEGCtrl
  MCode21.MPEGVideoM
  MCode21.MPEGAudioM
  MCode21.MPEGTrans
  MCode21.!RunImage
  ------------------
  
The real control code. Upgradeable independently of the rest of the system.
