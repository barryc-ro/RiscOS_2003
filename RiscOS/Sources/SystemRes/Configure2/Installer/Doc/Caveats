Known problems with the approach taken by Installer
===================================================

1) Source font aliases

Where the messages file in the source font directory contains aliases,
Installer does not copy these into the destination messages file.

2) Font encodings directories

When adding/updating/removing files in an Encodings directory within a Fonts
directory, Installer has no way to know that the files are going into a Fonts
directory, and subsequently does not update the MessagesN file(s). To get
around this, the caller must *Wipe !Fonts.Messages#* then install a new font;
Installer will then build a new MessagesN file for the current territory,
including the encodings.

3) Removal of whole !Fonts directories

When Installer is removing a complete !Fonts directory, first it removes fonts
with family names early in the alphabet, then it removes the MessagesN file(s),
then it removes the remaining fonts. This can result in the backup version of
the MessagesN files being incomplete, because when each of the early fonts is
removed it is also stripped from the MessagesN files.

4) Repeated removal of font faces

Take as an example the font family NewHall; this contains both NewHall.Medium
and NewHall.Medium.Italic. When asked to remove NewHall.Medium, Installer
recognises it as a font directory, and simply removes the files in that one
directory. If the same operation is performed subsequently, Installer no longer
sees NewHall.Medium as a font directory, and so performs a full hierarchical
removal, including NewHall.Medium.Italic.
