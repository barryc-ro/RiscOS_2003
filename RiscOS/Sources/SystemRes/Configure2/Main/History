0.10	10/12/1997	BJGA	Added info box handling code

0.12	15/12/1997	BJGA	Handles being quit from the Task Manager
0.13	16/01/1998	BJGA	Minor tweaks to !Boot/!Run, changed CMOS file

				'Default CMOS' menu items, and now uses
				BootResources:Configure.!* to locate plug-ins
0.14	02/02/1998	BJGA	Plug-in system decsriptor changed to &50DBF
0.15	27/03/1998	BJGA	Now handles multi-directory BootResources$Path

0.16	29/04/1998	BJGA	Can now cope with BootResources$Path being
				unset (change is actually in ConfigureLib).

				cannot be found. If Boot$OSVersion is unset,

				Message_PlugInQuitAbort now broadcast before
				first Message_PlugInQuit
2.00	24/07/1998	BJGA	Re-running Configure while it's still active
				now forces the main window of the existing
				application to the top of the window stack,
				instead of bringing up an error box; cranked
				version number up to 2.00 to avoid clashes
				with old !Configure apps
2.01	05/08/1998	BJGA	If !Help is already loaded, a click on the
				"Help..." menu item now broadcasts Message_
				HelpEnable 0 to ensure it is unsuspended.
