| The four cases suggested here for full-screen Replay video are as follows:
|   240 x 352 at 16 bit per pixel, the usual choice for VGA monitors
|   384 x 288, the usual choice for non-VGA monitors
|   480 x 352, providing a large logical area for VGA monitors (for very large movies)
|   384 x 288 at a different magnification, to provide a big play area for non-VGA movies.
