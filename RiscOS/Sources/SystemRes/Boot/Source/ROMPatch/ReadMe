New version of ROMPatch, introduced to patch 3.70,
and added to source tree for 3.71.

*** There is no proper make install - if changed, the ***
*** new !!ROMPatch obey file and ROMPatch directory   ***
*** (from Install directory) should be placed in:     ***
***                                                   ***
*** Sources.SystemRes.Boot.RO360Hook.Boot.PreDesk     ***


[ This release of ROMPatches also supports patching 3.60.
  To achieve this, the !!ROMPatch obey file and the ROMPatch
  directory should be in !Boot.Choices.Boot.Tasks in the
  3.6 !Boot. ]
