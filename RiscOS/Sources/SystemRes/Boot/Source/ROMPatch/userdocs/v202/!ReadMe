ReadMe for ROMPatch version 2.02, 24-Feb-97
-------------------------------------------

This release of ROMPatches fixes some problems with RISC OS 3.60 and
with 3.70. It supersedes ROMPatch 2.01 for RISC OS 3.70 (and provides
additional patches).


Purpose of patches
------------------

The problems fixed are briefly as follows:

 1) 3.70:      Slow printing to some HP printers on parallel port. (Same
               as ROMPatch 2.01)

 2) 3.70:      Occasional "No stack for trap handler" on some StrongARMs
               (SA110, revision less than 3). (Same as ROMPatch 2.01)

 3) 3.70:      Errors from some applications using several in-memory
               transfers in succession.

 4) 3.60,3.70: Crashes for very large in-memory transfers between
               applications (typically more than 7 Mb, or smaller transfers
               from applications with very large Wimp slots).

 5) 3.60,3.70: Failure of in-memory transfer if the transfer involves a 
               dynamic area at a very high address (2Gb or more).

 6) 3.60,3.70: System centisecond timing reference can run a few percent
               fast or slow for periods of about an hour. The system
               real time clock correspondingly gains or loses time until the 
               next hour, or until a reset.

 7) 3.60:      Floppy discs cannot be formatted if the hard disc is locked.
