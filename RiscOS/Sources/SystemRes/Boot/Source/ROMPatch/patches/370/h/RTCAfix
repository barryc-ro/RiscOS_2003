/*
   unconditional fix for RTCAdjust

   - On ROM start, RTCAdjust installs two CallEvery's instead of one. One is
     installed for module init, one for Service_Reset. The two are typically
     a few seconds apart, and the second can make a very large adjustment,
     based on an error over the very small interval, which is not readjusted
     for about an hour (the CallEvery period). The upshot is that the centisecond
     timing reference may run very fast or slow (several %) in some hours.

     This cannot be patched as such (the problem occurs during ROM boot), but
     can be fixed as a run time restoration of the intended single CallEvery.

     Hence, this routine returns NULL patches, but does the fix the first time
     it is called. It should be perfectly safe to mess with RTCAdjust's CallEvery
     at this time, because ROMPatch will be run by !Boot, long before the
     first CallEvery is due.
