   FreePool moves all the memory in application space into the free pool,
leaving only an amount equal to the WimpSlot -next value. This means that
applications running in the startup environment are given a next-slot's worth
of memory to work in, while leaving memory free for moving into the RMA,
system head, etc, if anything like that is needed.
