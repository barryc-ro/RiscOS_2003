; Trigger CBs - just fire off a few SWIs to let callbacks happen in the
; middle of an Obey file. Otherwise RMLoading MbufManager, Internet, Net
; all in one Obey file doesn't quite work properly; the Internet module
; hasn't sorted itself out or found its drivers by the time the Net module
; appears.
