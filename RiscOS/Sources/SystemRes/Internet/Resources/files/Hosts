# Host Database

# the accessible internet.  For each host a single line should be
# present with the following information:

#     official host name
#     Internet address
#     aliases

# Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab characters.
#  A ``#'' indicates the beginning of a comment; characters up to the
# end of the line are not interpreted by routines which search the file.
#
# Network addresses are specified in the conventional dot notation, a.b.c.d.
# Host names may contain any printable character other than a field delimiter,
# newline, or comment character.
