#| Hosts
#|
#| This file should contain the IP address and hostname
#| of every video server host which may be accessed by the STB,
#| and also every STB booting from this directory, as the STB
#| searches this file to obtain its own hostname. This
#| is combined with the time since boot, expressed in
#| hours:mins:secs, to obtain a unique player name for each
#| playback session, e.g
#|
#|       playername = stb23/2:42:27
