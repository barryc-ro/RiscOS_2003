FLASH ROM BUILDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The flash images use !Builder and one of the EtherISTB# env
files. These reference the BuildSys.Components.EtherISTB#
components files.

The following phases are usually required for a flash build:

  [*] List
  [*] Clean
  [*] Install RAM   (requires a fairly new !Builder)
  [*] Join ROM

This will create an image in the "Images" directory of your
build structure. Copy this into the Baseline as "FlashImg" and
settype it to Text (for historic reasons).

For every new flash image build which is going to be released,
you should update the BuildSys.Components file for that build
so that the FlashVsn module is built with an incremented version
number (i.e. each different released flash image can be uniquely
identified) - remember that this will affect the file:

  !STBBoot.PreDesktop.#.!Flash

(i.e. there will be a different value assigned to the system
variable "Flash$Version$STB#').
