| Remove the comments from the following lines if you want to redefine
| the keys used to launch the Engineering Menu. This should take the
| key codes as documented in the RISC OS Programmer's Reference Manual
| volume 1, page 849. The key codes stored here should also have been
| exclusive-ORed with &80 to give the correct internal code.
|
| Due to the design of the PS/2 keyboard matrix, there are restrictions
| on the number of keys which can accurately be detected simultaneously.
| If you want to scan for many keys, you should use modifier keys such
| as Shift, Alt and Ctrl.
|
| The keys specified here as an example, denote left-alt, right-alt and
| 'Q'.
|
| E.g.  Key0 = left-alt  = &05 XOR &80 = &85
|       Key1 = rigth-alt = &08 XOR &80 = &88
|       Key2 = 'Q'       = &10 XOR &80 = &90
|
|SetEval EngMenu$Key0 &85
|SetEval EngMenu$Key1 &88
|SetEval EngMenu$Key2 &90
|SetEval EngMenu$Key3 &90
|
| Note: set all of these values to &00 to reset to the old "Select" key
| mappings.
