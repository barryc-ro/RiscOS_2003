| Set the minimum size of the font cache (KBytes) - Default 128K
| Note that the font manager will try to discard data for fonts that are not in
| use in order to reduce the font cache size down to this value. If you are
| using fonts with many characters (e.g. Asian ones) you may want to increase
| this value to improve caching. If the outlines are in memory (e.g. inside a
| TFTP archive) 256K should be enough since only the font bitmaps are cached.
| If the outlines are on a server you may want a much larger value so that
| more outlines remain cached.
Set Fonts$CacheSize    "128K"

| Set the maximum size of the font cache (KBytes) - Default 128K
| With large (e.g. Asian) fonts a larger value is appropriate. If the outlines
| are in memory 1024K should be enough. If the outlines are on a server, a
| larger value will improve performance at the expense of memory usage.
Set Fonts$MaxCacheSize "2048K"

| Set the maximum point size for anti-aliased fonts - Default 32
Set Fonts$AntiPointMax  "36"

| Set the maximum point size for cached fonts - Default 32
Set Fonts$CachePointMax "36"
