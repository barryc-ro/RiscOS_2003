This component is used as a catch-all for debugging instruments. If there are
any applications which would be of use for debugging STBs, they should be
installed into the !DEBUG directory.

Examples of debugging applications (applets) are:

  !SmallPlay
  !OSCLI
  !STBSummry

Debugging has three levels:

  Level:	Debug$State	Meaning:
  off		<unset>		debugging features disabled
  on		"Low"		debugging features enabled
  high		"High"		extra debugging features enabled

Extra debugging features include:

  è Browser can be killed with Ctrl-F2
  è Java stderr and stdout redirected to files in <Choices$Write>
  è NCFresco errors spooled to file in <Choices$Write> (if debug build)
  è STB boots to the STBSummary page
