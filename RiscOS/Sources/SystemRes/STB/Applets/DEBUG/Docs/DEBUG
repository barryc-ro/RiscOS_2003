This component is used as a catch-all for debugging instruments. If there are
any applications which would be of use for debugging STBs, they should be
installed along-side the !DEBUG directory.

Examples of debugging applications (applets) are:

  !SmallPlay
  !OSCLI
  !STBSummry

Debugging has three levels:

  Level:	Debug$State	Meaning:
  off		<unset>		debugging features disabled
  on		"Low"		debugging features enabled
  high		"High"		extra debugging features enabled

Extra debugging features include:

  è Browser can be killed with Ctrl-F2
  è Java stderr and stdout redirected to files in <Choices$Write>
  è NCFresco errors spooled to file in <Choices$Write> (if debug build)
  è STB boots to the STBSummary page
