GCPlay
======

GCPlay is a specialised video client for playing games using the G-cluster
games server. It acts as a front end for the GC Generic protocol module and
takes care of sending key/joystick input to the server.

Starting a session
------------------
A game session is started by using a URL of the form:

gcplay://<server>:<port>/

The URL path is not used, but if "?" is present the following options can be
set in the query portion of the URL.

"joythreshold=<n>" : If present, this sets the analogue joystick threshold
value. This must be a number between 1 and 127 and the default is 63.
Increasing this number means that the joystick must be moved further before
movements are reported to the server.

"debug" : If this is present, debug mode is enabled and debug options are
displayed in a menu on the screen.

"noaudio" : If this is present, the audio stream is ignored. This is only for
testing purposes.

Example URL:

gcplay://136.170.52.70:4999/?debug&joythreshold=23

Stopping a session
------------------
A session is stopped by pressing the 'Back' or 'Home' buttons on the remote
control, or by pressing 'S' on the keyboard. The session will also stop if the
server stops sending video data, or closes the control connection. In the
latter case no error is reported, unless debug mode is enabled. The last error
to occur is recorded in the system variable GCPlay$Error however.

Input devices
-------------
Key presses are trapped by an event handler and the up/down events sent to the
server. The key numbers sent in the 'axis' field of the G-cluster input event
packet are the low-level numbers used by the event handler. See PRM 1-156 for
details.

GCPlay also supports the Paradise parallel port joypad interface. If the
"Joypad" module is present in the System:Modules directory it is loaded by the
!Boot file. The following axis numbers are used in the input event packet:

128 : Left joystick analogue X position
129 : Left joystick analogue Y position
130 : Right joystick analogue X position
131 : Right joystick analogue Y position
132-139 : Buttons
140 : Left
141 : Right
142 : Up
143 : Down

Note that when the joypad is in analogue mode, the digital left/right/up/down
buttons are ignored.
