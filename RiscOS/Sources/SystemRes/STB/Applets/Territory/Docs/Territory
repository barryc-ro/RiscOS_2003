The Territory component is a cludge of galactic proportions; it provides a
method for configuring STB territory, time zone and language encoding either
globally (for all STBs booting from a given Baseline), or on a per-STB basis
(by mapping the above config options to the STB MAC address).

The !STBBoot.Choices.Territory.Config file contains global settings.

The !STBBoot.Choices.Territory.Override file contains per-STB mappings.

At the time of writing, it only /really/ supports UK, USA, French and
French-Canadian territories (assuming the required modules are installed into
!System).
