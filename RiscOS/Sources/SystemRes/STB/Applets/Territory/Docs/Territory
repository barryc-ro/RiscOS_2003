The Territory component is a cludge of galactic proportions; it provides a
method for configuring STB territory, time zone and language encoding either
globally (for all STBs booting from a given Baseline), or on a per-STB basis
(by mapping the above config options to the STB MAC address).

The !STBBoot.Choices.Territory.Config file contains global settings.

The !STBBoot.Choices.Territory.Override file contains per-STB mappings.

This component also houses the options pages for the STB. They are nested
within an OS-specific subdirectory (i.e. "400") then the locale-specific
subdirectory (i.e. "400.USA").

You cannot have support for both V1 and V2 variants of NCFresco in a single
Baseline!
