| NOTE: any time server configuration information returned in the DHCP response will take
| precedence over the configuration STB$TimeServer and STB$NTPServer system variables!

| Set the following system variable to the IP address of the server you want to use
| to get the initial time for the STB during the boot sequence. This server is also
| used to periodically get the network time if no NTP server is specified. If both
| this line and the NTP server line are commented-out, the STB will never contact
| the network to get the time (unless time server information was supplied in the DHCP
| response).
|Set STB$TimeServer <Inet$BootServer>

| Set Real-Time Clock in the STB using an NTP server, if required. This option overrides
| the above RFC868 setting for reading the network time periodically while the STB is
| active. It does *not* guarantee that the time when the box completes booting will be
| correct; for this, you should also use the above system variable.
|
| NOTE: this variable can take a server name rather than an IP address (unlike the above
| variable, which can only accept an IP address).
|Set STB$NTPServer earth.eng.cam.pace.co.uk

| Remove the comment from one of the following lines to configure the Daylight Saving 
| Time facility.
|
| Note: times should be specified in UTC (the default facility uses the European rule)
|Set NetTime$DST European
|Set NetTime$DST 7-Apr-2002.10:00:00;27-Oct-2002.10:00:00
|Set NetTime$DST No

| Set your local time offset from UTC; this *will* override any time zone specified by DHCP 
| and it will default to the NVRAM setting if neither is used.
|Set STB$TimeZone "-8:0"

| Change the territory name to alter the default territory (default is UK)
|Set STB$Territory USA

| Remove comment and set to the language as specified in HTML 4 specification. This string
| is sent in the Accept-Language HTTP header and is optional
|
| Examples:
|   China   zh,en,en-us
|   Japan   ja,en,en-us
|   Korea   ko,en,en-us
|   Taiwan  zh-tw,en,en-us
|   USA     en-us,en,en-gb
|
|Set STB$Languages en-us

| Set the default font encoding (if not specified in HTML page)
| The default is 2252 (Microsoft Latin 1)
| 2252 = Microsoft Latin 1
| 4004 = Japanese (Auto Detect)
|   18 = Japanese (EUC)
|   17 = Japanese (Shift-JIS)
|   38 = EUC-KR (Korean)
|   39 = Japanese (JIS)
| 2025 = Chinese Simplified (GB2312)
| 2026 = Chinese Traditional (Big Five)
|Set STB$Encoding 2252

| Remove the comment from the following line to make the STB pre-load the font
| for the configured territory into RAM. This only has an effect if the configured
| territory is a 'CJK' font, such as Taiwan, China, Korea or Japan.
|Set Fonts$CacheTerritoryFont Yes

| Remove the comment to force pre-loading even if the font is not for the configured territory.
|Set Font$CacheChina  Yes
|Set Font$CacheJapan  Yes
|Set Font$CacheKorea  Yes
|Set Font$CacheTaiwan Yes
