STBSystem is similar to a normal RISC OS !System directory but with some
notable differences:

  1) It is the designated home for ALL relocatable modules in the Baseline;
  2) 'Modules' directories are traversed in a different order;
  3) It is very slimmed-down.

In more detail, item (1) simply means that we have specified that ALL
relocatable modules should be installed into one or more of the system
'Modules' directories.

This makes it easier to maintain systems that customers may have introduced
their own software into.

For item (2), the STBSystem works as follows:

  i)  A module is looked-for in the STB-specific dir (ie: 300.Modules)
  ii) The generic dir is then checked (ie: Modules)

There are two reasons for this:

  a) it saves directory enumerations, which can be expensive on network file
     systems.
  b) when TFTP archives are generated of a Baseline, they may exclude module
     directories for unsupported machines to reduce the archive size. This
     means some modules may be 'lost' with a traditional !System.

Item (3) requires no further explanation.
