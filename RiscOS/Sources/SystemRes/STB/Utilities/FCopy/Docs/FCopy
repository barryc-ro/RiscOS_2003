FCopy is a very simply file copying utility. It loads the file into a dynamic
area and saves it out to the destination, then ensures access and date stamp
(inc. file type) are the same. It is not recursive and does not copy
directories.

The only reason this exists is because *Copy often fails with "Unable to move
memory" at obscure moments when used in the boot sequence.

Syntax: *FCopy <source file> <dest file>
