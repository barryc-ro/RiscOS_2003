*RMLoad2 <file>

This transient utility can replace RMLoad (ie: set an alias for RMLoad to this) by
providing the same functionality with a small benefit; if the module is in ResourceFS,
it will be linked into the module chain in place.

This trick currently doesn't work with RamFS or CacheFS as they don't return the base
address of the module in the same way as ResourceFS (via the FS information word).

Note that if the module in ResourceFS is squeezed (using ModSqz), it will be RMLoaded
as normal.

Note also that any unsqueezed C modules in the ROM part ResourceFS will cause nasty
crash problems if this utility is used to load them. However, this is unlikely (I
cannot think of any circumstance where this would happen).
