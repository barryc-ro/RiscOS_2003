*RMLoad2 <relocatable module>

This transient utility can replace RMLoad (ie: set an alias for RMLoad to this)
by providing the same functionality with a small benefit; if the module is in
ResourceFS, it will be linked into the module chain in place.

This trick doesn't work with RamFS or CacheFS (or any other FileCore FS) as
they don't return the base address of the module in the same way as ResourceFS
(via the FS information word).

Note that any unsqueezed C modules in the ROM part ResourceFS (MUST be a C
module, it MUST be unsqueezed and it MUST actually be in ROM not RAM) will
cause nasty crash problems if this utility is used to load them because the C
module will attempt to write to itself to initialise the misc gubbins inside.
The write will, of course, fail with a DataAbort.

However, this is unlikely to be done by any /sane/ build master - I cannot
think of any circumstance where this would be useful ;)

Squeezed C modules don't cause a problem because they are copied (by the
Kernel) into RMA, which is writable, before being unsqueezed.
