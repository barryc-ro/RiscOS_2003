*Modify -with <var> -add <str> [-before <str> | -after <str> | -replacing <str>] [-ci]

Add or remove a (sub)string to and from the specified system variable. The presence of
the '-ci' switch indicates that the comparison is case-insensitive.

Some examples are (if Run$Path is set to "Build:,,%.,Boot:Library.,Inet:bin."):

  *Modify -with "Run$Path" -add "Tmp:," -after "Boot:Library,"

  Would give: Run$Path = "Build:,,%.,Boot:Library.,Tmp:,Inet:bin."

  *Modify -with "Run$Path" -add "Tmp:," -before "BOOT:LIB" -ci

  Would give: Run$Path = "Build:,,%.,Tmp:,Boot:Library.,Inet:bin."

  *Modify -with "Run$Path" -add "" -replacing "Boot:Library.,"

  Would give: Run$Path = "Build:,,%.,Inet:bin."
