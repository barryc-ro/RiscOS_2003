*FontPath

Changes the search order of Fon$Path parameters

Should be called by TerrFont to re-order the parameters after it does
a FontInstall.

Reduces likelihood of the STB hanging when it can't find fonts on the
network paths by ensuring fonts in Resources: are searched first.

Order is based on the first 3 characters of the path name:
 1  Res
 2  Other
 3  STB
 4  NFS

If using Asian fonts the baseline should be set to cache the territory
font otherwise this utility will not stop the STB hanging.
