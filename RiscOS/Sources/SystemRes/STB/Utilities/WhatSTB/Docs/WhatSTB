WhatSTB

Sets OS$Version to reflect the type of STB (and STBOS version) as follows:

  100	STB1
  200	STB2
  220	STB22xx
  300+	STB3, STB400 and above (the OS version number)

This is roughly how the utility works...

  IF FindModule("OSVersion") THEN
    stb = STB3 or above   { extract the version from the *FX 0 string }
  ELSE
    IF FindModule("DOSFS") THEN
      stb = STB1          { the oldest 'known' STB }
    ELSE
      IF FindModule("MPEG2Video") THEN
        stb = STB22xx
      ELSE
        stb = STB2        { an old STB 2 }
      ENDIF
    ENDIF
  ENDIF

The extract routine is hard-wired to assume that the version number in the *FX 0
string is the first set of numeric characters immediately following a space and is
of the format "d.d.d". This gets translated into "ddd" format in the OS$Version
system variable.
