WhatSTB

Sets NIM$Version to reflect the network card in the STB (ie: 'ATM' or 'Ethernet').
Also sets OS$Version to reflect the type of STB (and STBOS version) as follows:

  100	STB1
  200	STB2
  220	STB22xx
  300+	STB3 and above (the STBOS version number)

This is roughly how the utility works...

  IF FindModule("OSVersion") THEN
    stb = STB3 or above   { extract the version from the help string }
  ELSE
    IF FindModule("DOSFS") THEN
      stb = STB1          { the oldest 'known' STB }
    ELSE
      IF FindModule("MPEG2Video") THEN
        stb = STB22xx
      ELSE
        stb = STB2        { an old STB 2 }
      ENDIF
    ENDIF
  ENDIF

The extract routine is hard-wired to assume that the version number is
the first set of numeric characters in the help string of the module
"OSVersion".

The format is "d.dd" so it is assumed that this is always going to be
three chars
