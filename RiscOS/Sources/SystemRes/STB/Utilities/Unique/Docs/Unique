The Unique utility does a few things. Read the comments in the source for more
info. An outline is given below:

  è Parse the Baseline versions file and put result into Baseline$Version
  è Set STB$Unique to the Unique ID (if any), ie: OS_ReadSysInfo 2 or 4
  è Store the STB MAC address in STB$MACAddress
  è Store the STB RAM size (in MB) in STB$RAMSize
  è Attempt to create a writable directory and set-up Choices$* vars

The writable directory is unique to each STB. It is created in the Baseline's
Public directory and the leaf name of the directory is the STB MAC address
(in upper-case hex, ie 'AA00CD3240D4').

If for any reason creating the unique Public subdirectory fails, a directory is
created in CacheFS.

Once we have the writable directory, Choices$Dir, Choices$Write and
Choices$Path are set-up. If the program fails during the above two phases, the
Choices$* vars are set-up to point at Wimp$ScrapDir.
