Purpose of patches
------------------

The problems fixed are briefly as follows:

 1) 3.70:      Slow printing to some HP printers on parallel port. (Same
               as ROMPatch 2.01)

 2) 3.70:      Occasional "No stack for trap handler" on some StrongARMs
               (SA110, revision less than 3). (Same as ROMPatch 2.01; see
               TechNote for advice for code developers.)

 3) 3.70:      Errors from some applications using several in-memory
               transfers (SWI Wimp_TransferBlock) in succession.

 4) 3.60,3.70: Crashes for very large in-memory transfers between
               applications.

 5) 3.60,3.70: Failure of in-memory transfer if the transfer involves a 
               dynamic area at a high address.

 6) 3.60,3.70: System centisecond timing reference and system clock can run
               a few percent fast or slow for periods of about an hour.

 7) 3.60:      Floppy discs cannot be formatted if the hard disc is locked.


Installing patches for RISC OS 3.60
-----------------------------------

If you have any third party patches, remove them from your !Boot
first (see compatibility section, below).

If you have used any previous form of Acorn ROM patching for RISC OS
3.60, remove it from your !Boot first.

The patches are easily installed by copying the supplied Obey file
!!ROMPatch and the supplied directory (with contents) ROMPatch
into your

 !Boot.Choices.Boot.Tasks

directory. To do this, open !Boot by holding down the Shift key
while double-clicking on !Boot. Next, double-click to open Choices,
then Boot, then Tasks. Now drag !!ROMPatch and ROMPatch into
Tasks.

Finally, restart your machine to activate the patches. You will
notice a new dynamic area 'ROM patches 3.60/1' in the task bar
display, if you click on the Acorn iconbar icon.


Installing patches for RISC OS 3.70
-----------------------------------

If you have any third party patches, remove them from your !Boot
first (see compatibility section, below).

The patches are easily installed by copying the supplied Obey file
!!ROMPatch and the supplied directory (with contents) ROMPatch
into your

 !Boot.Choices.Boot.PreDesk

directory. To do this, open !Boot by holding down the Shift key
while double-clicking on !Boot. Next, double-click to open Choices,
then Boot, then Predesk. Now drag !!ROMPatch and ROMPatch into
Predesk.

If you have used the previous release of ROMPatch (2.01), this will
update it.

Finally, restart your machine to activate the patches. You will
notice a new dynamic area 'ROM patches 3.70/2' in the task bar
display, if you click on the Acorn iconbar icon.


Compatibilty with third party patches
-------------------------------------

ROMPatch may not be compatible with third party patches (eg. to
add desktop features). We recommend that you remove them from
your !Boot structure at least to test installation of ROMPatch.

You may then wish to try reinstalling them, and check behaviour
again.

The most likely incompatibility is caused by modules being copied
out of the ROM (eg. RMFaster). This can either disable or scramble
any bug fix by ROMPatch in that module, depending on the order
of running the patches.

In general, RMFaster, or any module copying from ROM may cause
problems with a patched ROM.
