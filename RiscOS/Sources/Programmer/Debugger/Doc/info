Text extraction

Version: 1.25, AMG 11 Mar 91.

Fixing erroneous disassembly of ADR Rd,R15,Rm as an ADR. Bug was introduced
in 1.23. Also changed OS_Confirm usage to rely on the EQ flag returned as 
an affirmative response rather than an ASCII 'Y'. This version has NOT been
tested since the Territory Manager is required from version 1.24 onwards,
though both my changes have been checked in an earlier source.

Version: 1.26, AMG 12 Mar 91.

Altered handling of wacky shifts to give ADD R0,R0,#0,ROR #24 instead of
the less intelligible ADD R0,R0,#0,24 which no-one seems to like. Again
this was done blind, after checking the idea with 1.23's source.
