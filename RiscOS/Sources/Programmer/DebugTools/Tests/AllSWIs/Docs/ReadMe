This module adds a claimant to all of the OS SWI vectors which simply counts
the number of times each OS SWI is called (both X and error-returning forms).

The counters can be output for all SWIs using the star command:

  *AllSWIs

You can also output the count for just one SWI using:

  *AllSWIs <swi number in hex>

or:

  *AllSWIs <swi name>

or:

  *AllSWIs <base number>_<swi number in specified base>

For example:

  *AllSWIs D4                        for OS_ConvertHex8
  *AllSWIs 10_212                    for OS_ConvertHex8
  *AllSWIs OS_ConvertHex8            for OS_ConvertHex8
