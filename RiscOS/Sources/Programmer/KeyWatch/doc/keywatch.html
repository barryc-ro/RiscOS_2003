    <h2> <a name="overview"> 1.0 Overview </a> </h2>

    <P>There is a need amongst a number of applications (eg ICA, Java)
      to be able to capture all the users key-presses individually,
      rather than in the transformed form given by the Wimp. This
      module provides access to all these events in formats suitable
      for the applications currently requiring them.

    <P>The goals of this module are 
    <OL>
      <LI>It should be as simple as possible
      <LI>It should sit on top of existing interfaces and not require
	any changes to other modules (eg Wimp, Kernel etc.)
      <LI>It should work on RISC OS 3.1
      <LI>It should not introduce any significant extra problems to
	any future work to upgrade the RISC OS input system.
    </OL>

    <P>To cut down on module proliferation this is an extension of the
    KeyWatch module originally created for the NC100. This module (in
      version 0.01) originally only implemented the first two SWI calls.

    <P>
      <!-- ======================================================================= -->

      <!-- ======================================================================= -->

    <hr  noshade>
    <h2> <a name="technical"> 3.0 Technical background </a> </h2>

    <P>The module accomplishes its task by looking at the events
    generated 
    <OL TYPE="a">
      <LI>when a key is pressed or released 
      <LI>when a key is
	entered into the keyboard input buffer. 
    </OL>

    <P>On KeyV the kernel first calls EventV to pass the key up or
      down event and then processes the key through the international
      keyboard handler and, if necessary, inserts the key into the
      keyboard buffer. After a suitable interval if the key is still
      held down then it inserts the key in the keyboard buffer again.

    <P>All this information is combined to generate a new key event
    stream containing all the extended data required.

    <P>The characters inserted into the keyboard buffer by the
      keyboard driver are removed by the KeyWatch module therefore an
      application using this interface will not receive any keys
      through the usual wimp key event interface.

IN:
	R0 = flags
		bits 0-31: reserved
OUT:
	R0 = Address of PollWord
    </PRE>

    <P>Register with the module to have a pollword updated.



    <H3>SWI KeyWatch_Unregister (+01)</H3>

    <PRE>
IN:
	R0 = Address of PollWord

OUT:
    </PRE>

    <P>Unregister a previously allocated pollword.



    <H3>SWI KeyWatch_Version (+02)</H3>

    <PRE>
IN:
	R0 = flags
		bits 0-31: reserved
OUT:
	R0 = feature flags
	R1 = major version * 100
	R2 -> minor version string
    </PRE>

    <P>Return version and feature information about the module.



    <H3>SWI KeyWatch_RegisterScan (+03)</H3>

    <PRE>
IN:
	R0 = flags
		bit 0:  1 = store codes as PS/2 scan codes
			0 = store codes as Acorn internal scan codes
		bit 1:  1 = send code as message
			0 = store code in buffer
		bit 2:  1 = include mouse clicks
			0 = ignore mouse clicks
		bit 3:  1 = store key transition events (scan codes)
			0 = ignore transitions
		bit 4:  1 = store buffer events
			0 = ignore buffer events
		bit 5:  1 = remove code from input buffer
			0 = leave code in input buffer
		bits 5-31: reserved
		
	R1 = wimp task handle
OUT:
    </PRE>

    <P>Call this after receiving input focus to change from using
    KeyEvent to NewKeyEvent. Note that there may be characters in the
    input buffer before this is called. These will be delivered to the
    application as normal through the wimp key event. If possible
    these should be processed to avoid losing any key presses.

    <P>Note that even if scan codes are not entered in to the poll
      buffer then scan code processing is still performed which means
      that the shift state is accurate and the scan code is still
      stored with the buffer code.

      <P>If bit 5 is set then OS_Byte,145 is used to remove the key
      code from the buffer. This prevents the key press from also
      appearing via the Wimp key event or similar.


    <H3>SWI KeyWatch_DeregisterScan (+04)</H3>

    <PRE>
IN:
	R0 = flags
		bits 0-31: reserved

	R1 = wimp task handle
OUT:
    </PRE>

    <P>Call this after losing input focus or on window close to allow
      another window to set its mode correctly. 

    <P>If the application requested that key events were buffered then
    there may be keys left in the buffer. Therefore in this case the
    task should read any keys out using KeyWatch_Poll and send them
    back to the wimp using Wimp_ProcessKey so that they are sent on to
    the task receiving the input focus. This must be done before
      calling Deregister.

    <P>Similarly if the application had requested that the keys were
    delivered using messages then it should maintain a flag to say
    whether it currently owns the input focus and should call
    Wimp_ProcessKey for any messages received when it doesn't.


    <H3>SWI KeyWatch_Poll (+05)</H3>

    <PRE>
IN:
	R0 = flags
		bits 0-31: reserved
	R1 = wimp task handle
	R2 = address of buffer or null
	R3 = size of buffer
	R4 = max number of entries to retrieve
OUT:
	R0 = flags out
		bit 0: 1 = an overflow occurred on the internal buffer
		bits 1-31: reserved
	R1 = number of bytes per entry

	if R2 = NULL then 
	  R2 = NULL
	  R3 = size of buffer needed for all entries
	  R4 = number of entries pending
        if R2 <> NULL then 
	  R2 = byte after last buffer byte filled
	  R3 = size left in buffer
	  R4 = number of entries asked for and not retrieved
    </PRE>

    <P>The given buffer is filled with the pending data in the same
      format as the message data shown below. ie currently there are
      three words of data in the order flags, scan code, key code.

    <P>The flags in R1 are sticky and are cleared when some of the
    data is read from the buffer. R2 and R3 are updated with their new
    values after writing out the event structures. R4 contains the
    size of an individual structure (currently 12 bytes).

    <P>If the buffer address is given as null and the size of the
    buffer as zero then no data is written and R3 on exit will have
    been decremented by the size of the data that would have been
    written.

    <P>

    <H3>Command <CODE>*KeyWatchForceClose</CODE></H3>

    <P>This command forces keywatch to discard all registrations and
    detach from all event handlers. This means that it can be
    killed. It is only designed to be used if a client application
    crashes so that the module can be killed safely.

    <P>When a key code is event structure is created the scan code of
      the last key to go down is added to it. This only happens on
      the first key code received after the key goes down. Therefore
      an auto-repeat key can be distringuished by the fact that the
      scan code field is invalid.
   
    <P>Note that the scan code stored when a valid key code is stored
    and PS/2 scan codes have been requested is a 1 byte version of the
    code. Bit 7 set means it is an extended code (ie normally preceded
      by byte 0xE0);
