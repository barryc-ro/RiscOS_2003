-dmy and -delay are mutually exclusive since validity of time cannot be
checked at creation.
 eg.  At 22:00 26/2/97 the command "CronAdd -delay 1:50 -date 26/2/97" is
 run.  A while later, the time zone is changed by 1 hour, so that the
 delay ends on 27/2/97.

Schedule is activated when all of:
  1) UTC time is past
  2) Date is past
  3) Time is past recently.

Time is recently past when:
  1) Time is within last 2 hours(say)
  2) Time was in future

To estimate time schedule will be activated,
  Take specified UTC time - earliest schedule can be activated.
  Use now if now is later.
  Convert to local time ordinals.
  Adjust date if given and later.  If adjusted, set time to zero.
  Adjust time if given.  Make a note if this adjusts time backwards.
  Convert to UTC.
  Add 1 day if time went backwards.
