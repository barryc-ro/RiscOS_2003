(1) Copy contents of the Spark Archive to a hard disc (250Mb or larger).

(2) Double-click on !Env4 (build for 4 Megabyte Morris system).

(3) To build ROM image:
      In directory BuildSys.Morris4:
      - Double-click on !Config
        This ensures that the Makefile is uptodate w.r.t. Components

      To clean the system:
      - Double-click on !MkClean
        This will remove all derived objects in the Source tree with the
        following exceptions:
        (a) OSLib - to clean, open Sources.Lib.OSLib and double-click on
            MkClean
        (b) RISC_OSLib - to clean, open Sources.Lib.RISC_OSLib and
            double-click on MkClean
        (c) Dictionary tokens in Sources.OS_Core.Internat.Messages
            It shouldn't be necessary to rebuild the Dictionary, but
            if required, open Sources.OS_Core.Internat.Messages and
            double-click on MkCleanAll
      - The complete Install tree can be deleted (by hand) if wished
      - The complete Export tree can be deleted (by hand) if wished

      To build the system:
      - Double-click on BuildSys.Morris4.!MkSystem
        (if the Export tree hasn't been removed, the first two build phases
         'export hdrs' and 'export libs' can be commented out first).

      To split the ROM image into two 2Mb parts, use isplit <filename>


(4) To build HardDisc image:
    The harddisc components will be installed in 'Install' by default.
    This can be altered by setting an appropriate path for DiscInstall$Dir
    in !Env4 and re-executing. If the path isn't specified in terms of
    <Build$Dir>, use a complete disc specification:
    e.g. SCSI::disc_name.$.Install_path

      To build the system:
      - Double-click on BuildSys.HardDisc.!Mk
      When complete:
      - Double-click on BuildSys.HardDisc.!MkInstall
