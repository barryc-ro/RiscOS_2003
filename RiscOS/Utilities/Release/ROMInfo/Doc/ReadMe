ReadMe for ROMInfo.

	RomInfo is a utility that can display information about the modules
contained within a RISC OS ROM. 

Usage:
	ROMInfo <Image location> [-csv] [-loc] [-ressize]

	It has the following flags:
	-loc 
	This flag outputs the location that the module starts within the ROM
and the size of each module.
	-csv
	This flag outputs a CSV listing of the module information, as
required for Software Information Sheets.
	-ressize.
	This will attempt a rough calculation of the size of the resources
held within the ROM image. This is currently unoptimised and can take some
time, especially if accessing the image over a network.
