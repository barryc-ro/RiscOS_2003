Changes to ROMinfo

	The main change was modifying the reados() function to read an OS ROM
image from disc as opposed to a block in memory.  This change removed the
extension/expansion ROM functionality, this was replaced by changing the
readimage() function to call the old memory method when an
expansion/extension ROM is detected.  The function strfind() was added to
replace the memfind() function for locating a string in a block of memory,
this is used in conjunction with the new reados() function.  Two other
functions, findResourceFSBlockSize() and fastFindResourceFSBlockSize(), are
two methods of finding the size of a ResourceFS block at the end of an image
file.  They are discussed in more detail in the code comments.  A function
fsize() was added to find the size of an image file.  The rest of the program
remains fairly unchanged from the original.
