Help file for !LoadURL
----------------------

LoadURL is a simple program designed to interface with NCFresco.  It allows you to load web
pages into Fresco but unlike just double clicking on them you can specify the Frame Target into
which they are loaded.  This is especially useful for loading pages into the __dbox Popup frame
target.

The web page to be loaded can be dragged or typed into the file:/ writable.  Where the page is
loaded to depends on the Target optionbutton.  If it is ticked then the page will be loaded into
the target specified, otherwise it will be loaded into the main page.

To close a PopUp LoadURL takes the target specified (regardless of whether it is faded or not) and
issues a ncint:loadurl?remove=<TARGET> to NCFresco.
