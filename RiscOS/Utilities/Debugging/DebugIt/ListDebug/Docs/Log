Log file of changes to !ListDebug

07-Jul-95  Started.
04-Aug-95  Window behaviour for adding/removing lines in system font now
            seems to be satisfactory - and now in desktop font (although
            a fudge factor had to be included ...).
07-Aug-95  Now copes with change between system font and outline desktop
            font.
14-Aug-95  Optional line numbering, pause/resume, clear and saveas all
            implemented. Made available as version 0.02.
15-Aug-95  "dprintf(..)" will now send debugging output to a file (if one
            has been opened) and to the DebugIt module (if this is loaded).
25-Oct-95  Now uses version of DebugIt module with registered SWI numbers;
            released as version 0.04.
26-Oct-95  Extent of main debug window made much wider - so that it's
            possible to view very long lines. This update copied into the
            release directory, too.
           Source tree created under the SrcFiler - version 001.

07-Dec-95  Removed test option.
           Added "Buffer size" and "Ignore empty lines" options.
           RMEnsure 0.10 of DebugIt module.
           Added "Buffer size" for window option.

08-Dec-95  Enhanced buffer size options (current value is now inserted into
            dbox before display).
           Default buffer size is 32k.
           Version 0.05, SrcFiler version 002.

31-07-97   Placed an entry in the Messages file to allow the user to select monospaced
           fonts in the display regardless of the currently selected font.
           Version 0.06, SrcFiler version 003.

23-11-98   Modified file structure to conform to new build format.  Added
           !Mk, !MkClean and !MkClnAll.  With fussy warnings on a lot of
           'declared but not used' warnings appeared - they have been 
           dealt with.  Added the ability to configure buffer size.
           Version 0.07, added to CVS for the first time.
