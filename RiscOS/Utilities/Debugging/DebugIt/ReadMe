ReadMe for DebugIt
------------------

DebugIt is a debugging system written by MChallis for the Aquarius/Aurora 
projects.  There are two components:

DebugIt - a module which receives debug text from code being debugged and
passes it to any registered receivers.

ListDebug - is the only receiver app capable of registering with DebugIt to
receive output.  ListDebug provides a simple Wimp window to view the output.
