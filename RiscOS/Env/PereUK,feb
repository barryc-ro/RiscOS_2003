| STB22 system on STB22 hardware (Peregrine is STB22)
|
| 1999-07-23: BAL
| Created due to requirement to build ATM Boot ROM for STB22 system -
| requires components which have hardware-dependent features.
| Couldn't use the original Peregrine Env file because
| (a) it was removed from the repository
| (b) it used the old-style Env system
