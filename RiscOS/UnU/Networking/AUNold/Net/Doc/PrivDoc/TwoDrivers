One Ethernet III expansion card (full set of modules) One EtherH network
card (driver only)

  Ether3 starts
  Internet restarts
  Net retsarts
  EtherH starts
  Service call from Ether3, Net module uses Ether3, sets IP address on i/f
  Service call from EtherH (now bottom of Internet module's list but top of
  Service EnumerateNetwrokDriver list), Net uses first in Internet list, but
  reports self as using first in EnumerateNetwork Drivers list, which is
  EtherH.

If set mns.mns_module to module name of driver actually used when setting
the IP address in do_myaddress(), then actual use and reported use would
match. Would still have two i/fs up with same IP address.
