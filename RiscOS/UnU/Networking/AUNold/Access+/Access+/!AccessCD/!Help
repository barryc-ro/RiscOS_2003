!AccessCD
=========

The !AccessCD application allows you to set the size of the AccessCD data
cache, and allows details of CD shares to be saved so that they may be
automatically shared when the machine is next booted.

Details of all discs which are shared through the CDFS icon bar menu after
the !Access+ application has been seen will be saved inside the application.
When the application is first seen after the machine is rebooted, these discs
will be automatically be re-shared.

Running the !Access+ application will load the cacheing facilities and bring 
up a window which allows you to set the size of the RAM cache, which is used to 
speed up CD accesses from remote machines.

It will load CDFSFiler version 2.21 with share option enabled if you have an
old one.
