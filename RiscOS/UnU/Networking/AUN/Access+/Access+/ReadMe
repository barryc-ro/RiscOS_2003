      Access+ Applications
      ====================

The !Access application allows you to share a directory in an Authenticated
manner (so that access from the network requires a password).

!AccessCD speeds up the network sharing of CDROMs by setting up a cache
memory.

Both the applications have help files inside them to provide further 
information.
