 Changes to CDFS version 2.14 to make it 2.15:


 By Mark Watson of Eesox.  1st May 1993

 1. Funtion 'AnotherDriveHasBeenAdded' in file 'Open' was changed to use the new CDFSDriver SWI
    call CD_Identify.  This is so that additional CD-ROM drivers can be added without changes
    to CDFS.

 2. The block copy routine has been removed and the CD_ByteCopy SWI used instead.

 3. *Supported in file 'Misc' changed - don't know what is supported !

 4. Fixed XAR problem.
