 * Empty the output buffer --- called whenever buffer fills up.

 * In typical applications, this should write the entire output buffer
 * (ignoring the current state of next_output_byte & free_in_buffer),
 * reset the pointer & count to the start of the buffer, and return TRUE
 * indicating that the buffer has been dumped.
 *
 * In applications that need to be able to suspend compression due to output
 * overrun, a FALSE return indicates that the buffer cannot be emptied now.
 * In this situation, the compressor will return to its caller (possibly with
 * an indication that it has not accepted all the supplied scanlines).  The
 * application should resume compression after it has made more room in the
 * output buffer.  Note that there are substantial restrictions on the use of
 * suspension --- see the documentation.
 *
 * When suspending, the compressor will back up to a convenient restart point
 * (typically the start of the current MCU). next_output_byte & free_in_buffer
 * indicate where the restart point will be if the current call returns FALSE.
 * Data beyond this point will be regenerated after resumption, so do not
 * write it out when emptying the buffer externally.
