This is only needed for softloading a SoundDMA (Sound0)
that replaces ROM version.

The built NewSound and built SoundDMA (Sound0 renamed),
currently version 1.53, should be in

  Sources.SystemRes.Boot.RO360Hook.Boot.PreDesk.SoundDMA

with !run file, to be installed in !Boot (required for RISC
OS 3.7, which only has 1.51 in ROM).
