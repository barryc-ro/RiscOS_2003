LHardwick: dir read/write permission displayed for dirs by Filer.
LHardwick: The defaulting of a loged on user to their given home directory
   ( stored in the unix password file )? if no other path is given.
LHardwick: Interfaces to chmod and chgrp
LHardwick: C Library interface to NFS facilities
LHardwick: LOCKD
LHardwick: Hourglass
LHardwick: Can not currently save into directory with own group
   write access. But can CDIR ! fault is probably setting
   different group number before trying to save file. Can
   this be fixed ?
LHardwick: *free to be available to give quotas
LHardwick: terminal emulation (VT220 + AVC)
   terminal emulations over telnet are of course needed. I would suggest
   VT 220 and AVC to match the R140 specifications as a minimum. An API to the
   telnet application should be defined to allow alternative terminal
   emulators to access hosts via telnet.
WStoye: Set a csd on mount if no csd set already.
WStoye: shift-logon shouldn't open the viewer.
WStoye: Save of alternative field contents without having to edit template.
WStoye: Use the hourglass.
HMeekings: NULL char in cat and info output
LHardwick: Executing the *mount and *dismount commands in BASIC causes BASIC to execute the current BASIC program (well strange!).
LHardwick: bug:
   From RISC OS
   f12
   BASIC
   *nfs 
       (syntax error)
   *help mount
   *nfs
        (ok)

NB does not cause any error from command line
after the f12 but does cause the error if you
go into basic.

MHardy:

NFS bug:
========

When you try to copy a file from Risc OS to a mounted NFS partition, and the
file already exists (ie it should be overwritten), it doesn't work. Instead,
you get an "Insufficient access" error, and the NFS file loses all its
permissions.
