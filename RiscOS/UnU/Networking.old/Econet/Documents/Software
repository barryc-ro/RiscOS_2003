        Changes required to the Econet Relocatable Module.
       ====================================================

  1)    Remove all the hardware detection code.  This code will no
      longer be required since the loading of the RM into RAM will
      only occur when the hardware is present (because both are on the
      same Expansion Card).

  2)    Change the address of the Econet chip (MC68B54) from a fixed
      address to one stored in private workspace after being
      calculated from the initialisation value.

  3)    Change the addresses and masks used for the FIQ control
      registers in IOC to use the Podule_FIQ rather than
      InternalEconet_FIQ.


        New software required for an Expansion Card.
       ==============================================

  1)    A Loader, this is easily derived from an existing loader, but
      can only be done when the hardware design is complete.  This is
      because it needs the page register address and the page size as
      part of its design specification.

  2)    A Joiner, this is easily derived from an existing joiner, but
      can only be done when the hardware design is complete.  This is
      because it needs the page size and configuration as part of its
      design specification.

  3)    A stand-alone Econet messages file built as a module.
