Econet on a Podule.

Ideas for a product.


  1)  Econet interface as it is now (circuit-wise).

  2)  Socket the line driver chip.

  3)  Add tracks and layout for termination and for clock generation.

  4)  EPROM with Econet, NetFS, NetPrint, BBCEconet, BroadcastLoader,
      NetStatus, NetFiler and the required messages and templates.  Current
      sizes of the modules are (respectively); 11K, 25K, 8K, 2K, 6K, 1K, 6K.
      The total length of all the templates and messages files is 4K which
      means it should all just about fit in a 27512.

  5)  On-board non-volatile storage (NMC93C06 256 bit EEPROM) so that
      the use of system CMOS RAM is avoided.  Current usage is as follows;

        Station number          1  Byte         Econet
        Protection              1  Byte         Econet

        File server number      2  Bytes        NetFS
        File server name       15  Bytes        NetFS
        Library configuration   1  Bit          NetFS

        Print server number     2  Bytes        NetPrint
        Print server name       5  Bytes        NetPrint

        Sort mode               1  Bit          NetFiler
        Icon type               2  Bits         NetFiler

        Enable broadcast        1  Bit          BroadcastLoader

        Coloured hourglass      1  Bit          NetStatus

  6)  Choice of output connectors on prototypes; DIN, Mini DIN, 9 way D,
      and if space permits 15 way D.

  7)  Add a 'User Port'.
