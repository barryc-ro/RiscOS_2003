  From Peter Watkinson's email I have a list of the following hardware
tasks that will need to be done by me;

        Specify the product to be designed. Overview & detail.

        Hardware circuit design.

        Identify and specify any new components required.

        Enter schematic into Valid.

        Compile and remove any errors.

        Circuit design review.

        Supervise the PCB layout.

        PCB layout review.

        Test & debug.

        Re-iterate PCB if required.

        Write up TRM and notes for Service manual.


  The work required on the software (all done by me) is as follows;

        Modify Econet to keep the hardware address in RAM rather than
        burning it into the image.

        Make a stand-alone Econet messages module.

        Make a Podule Loader program.

        Make a Podule Joiner program.

        Blow EPROM images and test.
