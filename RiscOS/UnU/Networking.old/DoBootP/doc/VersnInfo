Version Info for DoBootP
========================

v0.03 24/10/95
--------------

CHanged operation to do just one bootp request, then reset the box.

This is to work around the bug in bootp, whcih means that only one bootp
packet ever gets sent even though there can be many requests issued by the
controlling application.
