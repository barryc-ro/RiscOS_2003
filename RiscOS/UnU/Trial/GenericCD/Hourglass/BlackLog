Version: 2.04 Wed 24-Oct-90        Ran Mokady                    

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 2.05 Thu 25-Oct-90        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Added a new SWI call (SWI Hourglass_Colours) that allows the setting of
     the colours that the hourglass is displayed in, and the reading of the
     old colours at the same time.

     Entry conditions:

        R0 = New colour to use as colour 1 (-1 for no change)
        R1 = New colour to use as colour 3 (-1 for no change)
     
     Exit conditions:

        R0 = Old colour that was being used as colour 1
        R1 = Old colour that was being used as colour 3

  *  Hourglass_Smash now restores the default colours (Cyan and Blue).

  *  Service_Error now calls the internal routine to smash the hourglass
     rather than actually doing a SWI call to itself.

  *  Service_Reset now checks to make sure the reset wasn't HARD before
     initialising its workspace.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 2.06 Wed 06-Mar-91        Neil Raine                    

  *  Hourglass_Percentage only sets the percentage if it hasn't already been
     set by some higher level, ie.

        SYS "Hourglass_On"
        SYS "Hourglass_On"
        SYS "Hourglass_Percentage",10           :REM sets to 10%
        SYS "Hourglass_Percentage",20           :REM sets to 20%
        SYS "Hourglass_On"
        SYS "Hourglass_Percentage",30           :REM DOESN'T set to 30%
        SYS "Hourglass_Off"
        SYS "Hourglass_Percentage",30           :REM sets to 30%
        SYS "Hourglass_Off"                     :REM turns off percentages
        SYS "Hourglass_Off"                     :REM turns off hourglass

  *  Hourglass_Off removes the percentages if they were initially turned on
     at the level pertaining before the Hourglass_Off.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 2.07 Wed 06-Mar-91        Neil Raine                    

  *  Fixed bug: Hourglass_Percentage,100 now re-enables alteration of the
     percentages at lower levels subsequently.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 2.08 Wed 27-Mar-91        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Internationalised the only error message to a kernel error message
     (BadSWI), now it has a proper error number as well rather than 10_486!

  *  Made a RISC OS 2.00 compliant version for the Broadcast Loader product,
     has the same version number, doesn't use MessageTrans, and has " (2.00)"
     appended to the help string.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 2.09 Wed 09-Oct-91        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Removed most switches from the source.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 2.10 Tue 01-Feb-94        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Put a semaphore in the ticker routine to stop reentrancy which caused
     stack overflow after vsyncs are turned off by DPMS.
