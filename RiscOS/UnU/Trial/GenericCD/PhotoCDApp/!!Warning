crose@omi.co.uk:  I copied the contents of this directory over from the
source filer and recompiled.  When I try to run !PhotoCD I get "No
writable memory at this address".  I have a 4M SIM in my STB.  In
addition there are error messages appearing on the screen.  This should
not happen.  See !CD or !AudioCD for how to trap these kinds of errors.
In the same context there are no problems with !AudioCD and !VideoCD,
although once PhotoCDApp has had a look in it things become broken and
nothing works thereafter, I suspect this is because !PhotoCD fails to
obey !CD's message passing protocol on encountering this particular
error.

Although I was supposed to take over PhotoCDApp (!PhotoCD), I never 
actually got a look in before moving on to other things.  This code is 
untouched by me.  

The above was done in a non ROM environment.  I was running the cd apps
on a STB from my RiscPC via ShareFS.
