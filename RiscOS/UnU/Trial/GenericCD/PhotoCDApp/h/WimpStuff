/*                  !cd's MESSAGE HANDLING PROTOCOL                      */
/*-----------------------------------------------------------------------*/

/*

Four message types exist in !cd's world.  These messages pass between !cd
itself, and the other cd task / application.  (At most, !cd and one other task
is active.  At least, only !cd is active in which case the machine is in an
idle state waiting for the user to insert a cd).  The four message types are as
follows.  In terms of coding, they are message numbers (see macro definitions
further below), also referred to as message actions on p.3-197 of the PRM.
Apart from TASK_HANDLE, none of the messages contain data beyond byte 20 of the
message block (refer PRM p.3-197). 

Messages TO !cd:-

(Action Number)

TASK_ACTIVE       Let !cd know that I am a new task starting up.

TASK_DEAD         Let !cd know that I am about to die.



Messages FROM !cd:-

(Action Number)

TASK_HANDLE       !cd broadcasts its task handle, thus allowing for direct
                  communication as mentioned above under TASK_HANDLE_ACK.

TASK_DIE          !cd tells the other task to die.


A task launched by !cd should obey the following rules:

1.  Send !cd a TASK_ACTIVE message when starting up.

2.  Wait for !cd to send it's task handle if you wish to communicate directly
    with !cd rather than on a broadcast basis.

3.  Tell !cd when I am about to die.  Do this by sending a TASK_DEAD message.

4.  If a TASK_DIE message is received from !cd, do number 3 above.

5.  All messages are user messages (event code 17 on p.3-116 of the PRM).
