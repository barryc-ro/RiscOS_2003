 !VideoCD ASSUMPTIONS:
--------------------

!VideoCD is part based upon the following assumptions.  So far, none of these 
assumptions have been found to be false.

1.  All video cd's contain either an EDISON wildcard text file in their root directories,
    OR they contain an MPEGAV directory in the root directory.  Non-video cd's do not
    contain $.EDISON*, nor do they contain an MPEGAV directory in the root.
    
2.  All MPEG file names on video cd's consist partly of numerics (e.g. TREK600/RTF,
    SEQ1/RTF,AVSEQ01/DAT).
    
3.  All MPEG file names on video cd's end in "/RTF" if they reside in the root directory.
    (But there can be other "/RTF" files in the root which are not MPEG files, e.g.
     Hunt For Red October disc 1 contains PAR_PRESENTS/RTF which has no packet starts
     codes (000001BA), no video packet codes (000001E0), no audio packets (000001C0),
     and no sequence start codes (000001B3)).
     
4.  All files in an MPEGAV directory are MPEG files.

5.  Some video cd's, for example Bryan Adams "Waking Up The Neighbours", 
    and The Naked Gun, apparantly contain no textual information.  The textual files 
    in the root of the cd all appear to be empty and any textual files found in other 
    sub-directories don't contain the disc name or any of the track names.  Although 
    the track names were displayed by the CD-i player, this could be because they are 
    part of a bitmap image and not because they  exist separately as text.
    
    i.e. green book music cd's do not contain track names.  Is is impossible to tell
    the user what the names of the tracks are from any textual information found on
    the cd.
    
6.  White book (Video CD) music videos contain a KARAOKE directory within which is a
    KARINFO/US file.  This file contains textual information which includes track
    title names.
    
    The track names within KARINFO/US are all found immediately after character
    sequences "|I|?",where ? is anything (including newline etc.).  Example:-
    |NKnight/Chapman%|NKnight/Chapman|@a|H|LUS1234567803|I|TBetter Be Good To Me.
    The |? part of the string tells us how long the title name is which follows.  E.g. 
    |FHeroes, ABCDEF, 123456, 6 is the length of Heroes.  If |I is followed by a newline,
    the newline character is 10, so the title length should be 10.  E.g. David Bowie 
    Let's Dance.  This will also pick up the Copyright Notice string and the cd title
    string, i.e. e.g.
    |@"|@|TThe Video Collection|A|F1234-5 |B17|@O|H|LUS1234567801|I|PCopyright Notice
    The "|I" part of the sequence is the tab character (integer value 9).
MODIFICATION - DAVID BOWIE CD.  AFTER HEROES.  |IBowie/Eno% etc. violates the
above.    Solution:- look for sequence "|I|?xxxxxxxxxx\n, where xxxxxxxxxx is the 
track title, xxxxxxxxxx must not contain any tab ("|I") characters.
Also, last track on Bowie the video collection - Blue Jean.  Can have tabtabtitle
i.e. |I|IBlueJean.
    
  
7.  If a cd contains an MPEGAV directory in it's root, MPEG files will only be found
    in the MPEGAV directory.  There won't be any MPEG files in any of the other 
    directories on the cd.
    
8.  In an MPEGAV directory, the first file may be a copyright MPEG clip, or it may
    not be.  If there is a KARINFO/US file as described above, this will indicate
    whether or not it's a copyright clip.  Failing this, if the size of the first file 
    in MPEGAV is < 12M (approx), it is a copyright clip, otherwise it is one of the 
    track titles.   

9.  The KARINFO/US file mentioned above is always 2048 bytes in length.

10  If the size of a file is greater than approx. 10M, and if it is in the root 
    directory, it is an MPEG file.
    

FALSE ASSUMPTIONS:-

These have already been checked and have failed.

1.  The first file in an MPEGAV directory on disk 1 only, is a copyright MPEG clip.
    FALSE:- Bryan Adams, Waking Up The Neighbours.  
    TRUE:- Bowie The Video Collection and Tina Turner.
    See assumption number 8 above.
    
2.  Carrying on with assumption number 6 above, immediately preceding the name 
    (including the copyright MPEG clip, but not the title ("The Video Collection" 
    above)), is a numerical sequence where the last two digits are the track number.  
    E.g. Better Be Good To Me above is file number 3, the copyright notice MPEG clip 
    also above, is file number 1.  But this doesn't apply to about half way through
    Bowie - The Video Collection, disc2, where everything stops and then remains at
    number 3.

OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS:-

1.  Tina Turner "Simply The Best '94" contains a $.CDI.CDI_ALL/RTF file (as well as
    an MPEGAV directory containing MPEG clips).  This file is 21 MBytes.  It does not
    seem to be a video or a video only MPEG clip.  What type of file is it?  It's 
    possible it could be the player software as used by Philips CD-i players.  The
    file doesn't contain any MPEG sequence start codes or picture start codes as
    defined in the MPEG video spec.
