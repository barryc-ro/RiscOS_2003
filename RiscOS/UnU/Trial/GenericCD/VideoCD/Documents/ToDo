                            OUTSTANDING (!VideoCD)
                            =====================
                            
*  Slow motion in !VideoCD - repeated slow motion button presses cause it to jerk
   and slow down etc.  Check and fix.
   [Priority: Low]
   
*  Get #define LOW_MEM (see display.c) working properly.  Title rubout bars
   aren't positioned correctly for this at present, as well as pointer positions
   etc.
   [Priority: Low]
   
*  Stop menu showing after ejecting from within BASIC Player.
   [Priority: Medium]

*  Volume control on the STB2 handset?
   [Priority: Low]

   grossly non-standard cd's.
   [Priority: Low]
   
*  Find a more reliable way of detecting whether NTSC or PAL.
   [Priority: Low]   

*  Improve performance (speed).  Release of the new CDFS should contribute 
   towards this.
   [Priority: Medium]
   
*  Add a mute icon to the player user interface library.  
   [Priority: High]
   
*  Take out use of the right and down right arrows for eject.  
   [Priority: Medium]

   [Priority: High]

   which have no titles and which have more than one column of clip
   numbers.
   [Priority: Medium]
   
*  Allow for higher numbers of MPEG clips on the digits only selection
   screen.
   [Priority: Medium]
      
*  Attempt to incorporate a "skip to" facility.
   [Priority: High]
   
*  The only way to change tracks is to return to the main menu.  Users expect
   to be able to use it like !AudioCD.  Adjust accordingly.
   [Priority: Medium]
   
*  Add a way of telling the user how many minutes into the movie he was when
   it was stopped so that he knows where to come back to later.
