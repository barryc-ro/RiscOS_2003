N.B. Beware for further testing - CDFS sometimes doesn't realise you've 
     changed cd's.  E.g.  did a . directory listing for Bryan Adams and got 
     MUSIC01/DAT thru. to MUSIC08/DAT.  Put in the Tina Turner cd and did a 
     directory listing.  Got the Bryan Adams directory listing!  Did . again
     and this time got AVSEQ01/DAT thru. to AVSEQ12/DAT, which is the Tina 
     Turner listing.  Inserted Hunt For Red October and kept on getting Tina
     Turner directory listing.  Reset machine when changing cd's.

*1 David Bowie Disc1 - Track 10 is a video only file (tested on Owen's CD-i
   player), but when I tried to play it with -noaudio (and -novideo just to
   see what would happen), drive access stopped more or less immediately and
   I got no picture on screen.
  
*2  Bryan Adams - Credits behaved same as David Bowie above (didn't try it
   on the CD-i player or with -noaudio or -novideo though).
  
*3 Bryan Adams assumption 6 - as expected no KARAOKE directory.

*4 Contained a non-MPEG file which was 6MBytes.  10M seems to be safe for
   now.
