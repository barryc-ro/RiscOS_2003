To be a legitimate VideoCD format disc, it must follow the spec, which
places certain requirements on MPEG encoding parameters, directory
structure, data files, file naming conventions & there must also be
a CD-i viewer program.  The naming conventions require the MPEG
bitstreams to be located in the MPEGAV directory, regardless of
whether the disc is PAL or NTSC.  The number and size of the files
in the MPEGAV directory will vary by title.  For most VideoCD discs,
only the largest file (typically 400-650MB) contains the (first half) of the
movie; the other files contain the bumper, FBI warning, etc.  I have
seen a couple of discs that divide the movie up into multiple  roughly
equally sized files.

In addition to those discs that actually carry the "VideoCD" or "VCD"
designation, I've seen several discs from Asia which are labelled "MPEG
Movie".  These discs do not seem to follow any convention at all--each
disc's directory is different.  The biggest hint I can offer is to look at
the size of the file: MPEG-1 Constrained Parameter Bitstreams use
approx 150KB/sec.
