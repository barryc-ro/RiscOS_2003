<CENTER><H3>25. What the heck does `Red Book', `Yellow Book', etc. mean?</H3></CENTER>
"Red Book" is the common name of the "Compact Disc Digital Audio  Standard".  When a disc conforms to the red book standard, it will  usually have "digital audio" printed below the "disc" logo.  Most music  CDs conform to this standard.<P>  "Yellow Book" is the standard for CD-ROM.  When a disc conforms to the  yellow book, it will usually say "data storage" beneath the "disc" logo.<P>  "Green Book" is the CD-I (compact disc interactive) standard.<P>  "Orange Book" is the standard for write-once compact discs.<P>  "Blue Book" is the standard for LaserDisc. **<P>  You can get the Red Book and Yellow Book from<P>      ANSI<br>      Attn: Sales<br>      1430 Broadway<br>      New York, NY  10018<br>      (212) 642-4900<br>      Red Book:       CEI IEC 908<br>      Yellow Book:    ISO 10149:1989<br>   You can get the Green Book from<P>      American CD-I Association<br>      11111 Santa Monica, Suite 750<br>      Los Angeles, CA  90025<br>      (213) 444-6619<br>   The Orange Book is still proprietary to Philips and Sony, and available   only to their licensees.<P>  [If anyone can tell me where the other standards are available, I will  include that information here.]<P>  ** [ "Blue Book" may be apochryphal.  Pioneer reportly has a pre-mastering       guide that may or may not have a blue cover, but it is not a statement       of the LD standard.<P>       The only standards found so far are IEC-857 (NTSC) or IEC-856 (PAL).       In the US, the only reliable source for these is Global Engr Documents.       They aren't cheap.<P>       '857 only covers the analog portions of LD.  It does not include       digital audio, TOC, LD-ROM, LD+G, CDV-5 or anything peculiar to       Laser Karaoke. ]<P>
