Version 1.00 28-11-95:  Initial release.
---------------------

Version 1.01 01-12-95:
---------------------

* Previously had to press SELECT to play something from the selection 
  screen menu.  Can now press either SELECT or PLAY to play something
  from the selection screen menu.
  
* Cd's without titles, i.e. numerical display only, on the selection
  screen -> pressing the right arrow button, down right, or blue button
  on the handset now results in the selection pointer moving to the eject
  option on screen, followed by actual eject.  This is more consistent with
  the titles selection screen display.
  
* Cd's without titles, i.e. numerical display only, on the selection 
  screen -> in maintaining consistency with the titles selection screen,
  the user no longer has to press SELECT after positioning the pointer 
  next to the Eject option.  Simply positioning the pointer next to the
  Eject option is all that is needed to eject the cd now.  This applies
  to both types of selection screen and is no longer specific to the titles
  selection screen.

* Standby now works from within the BASIC player program.
  
* Added screen dumping facility.

* More than 20 tracks on a cd which has no titles will result in error when
  attempting to display the selection screen.  A temporary safety check has
  been incorporated which limits the maximum number of tracks to 20 for 
  now.  (Refer Initialise() in main.c).  Unfortunately this safety check
  also limits the number of MPEG clips on cd's which do contain titles.
  Wants fixing in future.
  
  
Version 1.02 12-12-95:
---------------------

* Addition of -hoffset -44 in invoking the BASIC player program, to
  combat displaced MPEG caused by the Issue 2 MPEG cards.  Checked 
  with TDobson that it is now safe to always assume that -hoffset -44
  is required.
 
* !VideoCD now uses Dizzy's new Font Manager module if it is available.
  This results in neater blending of foreground and background colours.
  Dizzy has looked at a magnified screen dump of this being applied in
  !VideoCD (because initially I couldn't notice any difference) and confirms 
  that the results are as he expects.
  
* Incorporated drawer open detection code into the BASIC Player program.
  This is necessary because the BASIC Player program does not poll the
  wimp and therefore will not pick up any TASK_DIE messages from !cd.
  In previous versions if the user pressed pause and then manually ejected
  the cd without first un-pausing, !VideoCD would fail to realise that
  the cd had been changed and would get in a mess.  With the addition of
  the drawer open detection code this is no longer true.
  
Version 1.03 22-12-95:
---------------------

* Uses Dizzy's latest Fonts modules (Build.Sources.OS_Core.Video.Render.
  Fonts (ITable and Manager).  Version number was reduced to bring it in
  line with Acorn version numbering. 
  
* Updated "ToDo" list as a result of feedback from users.

* Renamed "Docs" directory to "Documents".

* Addition of Help screen, although currently it's not selectable from 
  within the BASIC Player program.  It can only be invoked by pressing
  the Help button when in the selection screen menu.
  
* As usual, memory tracing was turned on to check for memory leaks prior
  to release.
  
* Updated Video CD section of the !CD User Guide.

* Successfully tested a JPEG Help image of only 100 by 100 pixels with
  LOW_MEM undefined, and then with LOW_MEM defined.
  
Version 1.04 27-02-96:
---------------------

* Documentation changes.
