   Takes a JPEG splash file of any size and scales it up to fit the entire
   screen.  If the screen mode in which !cd is to run is known, it is useful to make
   the splash screen JPEG (on disk) the same width as the screen, but only half the
   height.  This halving means that a degree of anti-twitter will be achieved when
   scaling up as each of the original JPEG lines will be written to both of the
   interlace fields (assuming interlace screen mode).  Further anti-twitter is
   achieved by averaging over 3 lines once the image is on screen.  A more recent
   version of anti-twitter code is now available but !cd currently calls the old
   module because the new one has no effect.  The stage at which rescaling takes
   place depends upon the definition of LOW_MEM, which is described and defined at
   the start of display.c.
