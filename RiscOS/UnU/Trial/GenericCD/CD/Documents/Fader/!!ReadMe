                      Worried about "screen-burn"?

       Had a heavy lunchtime entertaining and forgot your sunglasses?

                           Worry no longer!

   Just let NFS::spinner.$.Sources.Anthony.Fader.Fader dim your screen!

Issue the magic rune "*Fade 128" and watch your screen drop to half brightness!

               Tell it "*Fade 0" and your cares will vanish!

      When you are ready to face the world again "*Fade 256" brings back
                        the sunshine to your life!

                  This has been a "Hax'R'Us" production.
