Indenting is controlled in three places.

1) HTMLRISCOS.c fills in the indent field of the ROStyle structure
   this is INDENT_WIDTH in spaces
2) tables.c/backend.c calculate the left margin from this value
   this is scaled by INDENT_SCALE (in consts.h)
3) obullet.c defines the width of the bullet item
   this is BULLET_WIDTH in spaces (in consts.h)
