Information categories

  1) Progress information from a fetch
     type=""
     can occur at any time, low priority

  2) Help information
     type = "Help"
     occurs as message reply when over status window, dbox, or menu
  
  3) Link information
     type = "Link"
     when over the main window, can be null

  4) Window title
     type = "Title"
     always available, only use when no other information available


These are two types of info really. 2 and 3 are exclusive and 4 is only
considered when 2 and 3 are null.

1 is always used when it arrives but if a simple string comparison is used
1 messages wil not last long when the pointer is over something that
generates messages.

So only generate 2-4 when pointer moves.
