STBWeb things to do
===================

Frames
 - Don't use margins when view is a frameset.
   This requires including the margins in struct fe_view_dimensions
 - Cope with moveable windows.
 * Ensure text is reformatted when scroll bars are added
   Added possible reformat after set_dimensions
 - Targetting of windows via the HTTP headers isn't finished. The
   access_d contains the information but I think it requires a target
   parameter to frontend_view_visit.
 - Make cursor link highlighting work with frames
 - Allow frame resizing.

Imagemaps
 * Cope with case where imagemap is stored in a separate file 
   to the image itself.
   Done - file is loaded/parsed/transferred to main map list/discarded
 * Add status messages to tell frontend which link you are over
   new call backend_item_pos_info can return this

Backend
 * Scale images to the size as given in the HTML.
 - Scale everything!
   This means anything that has an explicit pixel size attached to it.
   - Font size.
   - Image size.
   - Frame size.
   - Fixed size table elements.
   - Margins.
   - Indents.
 * Indent needs to be smaller/configurable
 - Text flow.
 - visited link recording/colouring
 * active link highlighting
 - URLs of the form /fred/bill convert to fred.bill rather than $.fred.bill
 * Better use of frontend_view_update for less flickery update on STBWeb
   All except mask images
 - Use of ALT labels when image can't be loaded for any reason
   I think this means changing oimage.c to be abe to render text as well
   as images - could be complicated.
 - Cacheing of tile sprite in current mode/palette.
 - IMG ALIGN=TOP is wrong.
 - P ALIGN=*
 - if input is off-screen then screen scrolls to view it in doc_complete
 - Word1"nl""tag"Word2 has no space in between the two words.
 - \r in PRE needs to be equivalent to \n
 - option to pause rendering until image size discovered.

Transports
 - Server push support (multipart/x-mixed-replace)
 - can we go over to direct to memory transfers?

Parser
 - <LI><P> shouldn't cause a line break - probably other cases also
 - Disallow line breaks except where explicit white space.
 - cope with unterminated entities better
 - Change paragraph spacing to be above and below rather than just above,
   this would improve the look of documents.

Cache
 - Needs to free space when needed. So if document downloading runs out
   of space, should remove something from the cache to make room.

Frontend
 - If first window has no margins then draw background window
 - Cope with changing screen size
 - Redraw with anti-twitter correctly without stomping on other windows
 * Scrolling menus
 * Button bar/Status bar
 * Keeping track of document position in the history list
 - Better hotlist control.
 * More controls in stbwebinternal
 - Fix losing of input focus when destroying frames (doesn't matter on 
   NC with Sennan running - but is a bit messy).
 +  Reintroduce RiscOSLib?
   Nope used toolbox instead
 - Do vertical cursor movement
 * Displayable history list
 - Paste text into FORM

Trial
 * Insert session management code
    URL when a site is requested, visited, or failed
    Only record domains for external sites, full URLs for internal
 - Alphanumeric entry 
   Probably not to be done
 * Better control of highlight colours
   Changed to use active link colour - should be better

Netscapeisms
 - Font colour
   This could have an impact on memory usage (colour needs to be stored
   per text item eg word)
 - HR attributes
 - list bullet/numbering attributes
 - NOBR/WBR
 - font styles (BIG,SMALL,SUB,SUP)
 - P/DIV and attributes.
 - TEXTAREA WRAP attribute

Microsoftisms
 - Font colour names
 - BGSOUND
 - BODY margins, bgproperties.
 - Font Face
 - Heading alignment
 - IMG multimedia support
 - MARQUEE (scrolling text)
 - Strikethrough
 
New stuff
 - PICS (Platform for Internet Content selection)
 - Style sheets
 - File upload
 - Embed audio/video support into STBWeb
 - Whole helper application business needs sorting out.
 - Directory displays as HTML pages (eg file: works as ftp:)
