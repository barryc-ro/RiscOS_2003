Borris,

A few collected thoughts on parsery stuff. Give me a bell sometime. I'm always
here till at least 7pm at the moment, I'm just away from my desk much of the
time between 5:30 and 7pm.

Some parser things to think of.

 -----------------------------
 1) Entities could be handled mroe robustly, eg this is fairly commonplace.

&amp</A>

You end up with something like 

&/A>

 -----------------------------
 2) This isn't right:
 
Hello
<A HREF="somelink">world</A>

comes out as

Helloworld

 -----------------------------
 3) Whereas:
 
<A HREF="somelink">
  <IMG SRC="someimage">
</A>

comes out as

<space><someimage><space>

and of the course since the spaces are part of a link they get underlined.

 -----------------------------
 4) In lists
 
<LI><P>Some text

comes out as

  *
    Some text

I'm sure it's illegal but it's very common.

 -----------------------------
 5) And then there are the many different ways of aligning things to cope
 with.
 
You can use <CENTER>, <P ALIGN=CENTER>, <DIV ALIGN=CENTER> and probably
others. They need to all work but be stacked separately so that ending
one doesn't end them all - I guess you already have something similar in
the tables code.

 -----------------------------

<SCRIPT>
</SCRIPT>

stuff gets passed to a separate parser that may generate some HTML that
will be inserted into the document at this point.

If this is done (which is possible although we're trying to avoid it) then
it will be done via wimp messages.

 -----------------------------

<STYLE>
</STYLE>

gets sent to the style sheet parser (hopefully built in) which will set
style values.

Same data can also be carried on STYLE attribute to be added to most
tags.

to be ignored for now

 -----------------------------
