The pictures in this directory were drawn using
Computer Concepts' ArtWorks package, and are
included as a demonstration of the display
capabilities of the computer. To see a picture
double-click on !AWViewer, the ArtWorks viewer
application, and then drag the picture file onto
the AWViewer icon on the icon bar.

These pictures look best in a screen mode with
32 thousand or 16 million colours.

In the AWViewer picture window, clicking with
SELECT or ADJUST will zoom in or out on the
picture.

Clicking and dragging with SELECT will create a
box. Releasing the mouse button will cause the
viewer to zoom into the box.

Clicking with SELECT while holding down the Ctrl
key will zoom the picture to 100%.

Clicking with ADJUST will zoom out of the
picture.

Clicking with SELECT while holding down Shift
will return to the previous scale factor (i.e.
the one before the last zoom).

There are no restrictions on the copying and
distribution of these ArtWorks pictures, but
please see the ReadMe file in the ArtWorks viewer
application for the conditions covering the
distribution of the application.
