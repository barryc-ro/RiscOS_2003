                  Hints And Tips For Playing Video Clips
                  --------------------------------------

To play the video clips in this directory smoothly with best results on an
A7000 or Risc PC without video memory, choose the following:

Screen mode -       Use the !ARPlayer 'Play big' button to play the video
                    full-screen, or choose a screen mode such as
                    640 x 480, 256 colours before playing.

!ARPlayer choices - Ensure that you do NOT use the 'Interpolate' option
                    on the !ARPlayer Global choices dialogue box.

Video clips -       Use the video clips in this directory, NOT those in
                    the HiRes subdirectory.
