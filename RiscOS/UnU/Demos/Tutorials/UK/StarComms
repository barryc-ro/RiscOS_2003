============================================================================


Introduction
============

This is an alphabetical list of every * Command available under RISC OS 3
(version 3.60). It does not contain * Commands provided by the addition of
expansion cards or extra filing systems.

Each command is followed by a short explanation of its function and its
command syntax. This is not intended as a complete explanation of the
command, but as a quick reference for experienced users who may prefer to
use the command line. All of these commands are explained in greater detail
in the RISC OS 3 Programmer's Reference Manual.


Command syntax
==============

The syntax of each command is described in a standard way. The symbols
used in syntax descriptions are:

<value>         indicates that an actual value must be substituted. For
                example, <filename> means that an actual filename must be
                supplied.

[...]           indicates that the item enclosed in the square brackets is
                optional.

|               indicates alternatives. For example, 0 | 1 means that the
                value 0 or 1 must be supplied.


The star commands
=================

*Access

    W   Write permission for you
    R   Read permission for you
    /   Separator between your permissions and the public's
