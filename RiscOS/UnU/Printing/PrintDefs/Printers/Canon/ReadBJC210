  The Canon BJC-210 is factory set to default to BJ emulation. You
  need to set LQ emulation before using the 210 with !Printers. This
  need only be done once. Refer to the printer user guide, or follow
  these instructions:

    - make sure the printer is turned off for at least 15 seconds

    - press and hold the power button, and listen for printer beeps

    - wait for eight beeps, then release the power button

  This sets European LQ mode, which is remembered until the set-up
  is changed again. The printer is now ready to use with !Printers.
