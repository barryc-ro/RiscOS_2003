Read_Me file for Acorn printers.
--------------------------------

The Acorn.JP-150 printer definition file is for
use with the Acorn JP 150 printer, which is a
Hewlett-Packard DeskJet Plus compatible printer.
See the HP.Read_Me file for more details.

Note that you should use "Generic DeskJet" paper
sizes in !Printers with the Acorn JP-150 printer.
If you use a version of !Printers earlier than
0.54, it will default to "A4 (Generic LJ)", which
you must change to "A4 (Generic DeskJet)". If you
do not do this, the output may be split over two
sheets of paper.
