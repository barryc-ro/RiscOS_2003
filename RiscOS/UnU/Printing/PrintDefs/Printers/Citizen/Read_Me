The following table shows which printer definition
file to use with which Citizen printer, together
with a brief indication of the DIP switch or
control panel settings needed on the printer
(don't select colour ribbon unless you have one
fitted):

To set the Citizen Swift 24E up, use the sequences
described below for the Swift 24, with the
exception that the Swift 24E has an extra category
at the start of the menus (LANGUAGE) and so you
will have to press JUMP twice rather than once to
get to the MAC CTRL stage (ie. "MENU", "JUMP", 
"JUMP", "MENU" to get to MAC CTRL DEFN MAC).

The "Citizen.Swift-24" printer definition file is
somewhat unusual. It utilises the unique features
of the Citizen Swift 24 to get the best results
possible from this printer.

Text printing is all done by switching the printer
to IBM Emulation Mode to allow the use of Code
Page 850 (Multilingual) which gives a very good 
mapping for the ISO Latin 1 character set.
However, the printer does not support the escape
sequence to switch code pages, so you must set the
printer up to default to IBM emulation mode, code
page 850 (multilingual). Additionally, you need to
enable the colour upgrade if it is fitted. This is
all done by using the printer control panel to
redefine MACRO 1, which contains the default
settings for the printer. This is detailed later.

Graphics printing is done by software switching
the printer to Epson  Emulation Mode, except for
the 360 DPI vertical resolution modes. For these,
the NEC Emulation Mode is used as this is the only
way to get the n/360 inch line spacing needed to
perform the vertical interlacing. Note that colour
printing should only be selected if you have
installed the colour upgrade in your Citizen Swift
24 printer.

The "Paper Y offset:" for this printer is 10 mm,
which is greater than the top margin of the "A4
(Generic DP)" paper size. This may cause graphics
output to appear slightly too far down the paper -
see the "Printers.Read_Me" file section on paper
offsets for more information. Also to get this
offset requires the printer VTOP (top of form) to
be set to -26 rather than the default of 0 using
the control panel. This is detailed later after
the main configuration information.

Although !Printers allows you to print in colour
at all supported resolutions, it should be
realised that resolutions above 180 by 180 DPI are
interlaced which results in 8 or 16 head passes
over the same line and on the second or subsequent
interlace passes, the light ribbon colours are
printed over dark colours already on the paper.
This can cause contamination of the lighter ribbon
colour.

The steps to configure the Citizen Swift 24 if you
do not have the colour upgrade fitted are given
below. If at any stage you think you have made a
mistake, switch the printer off and start the
sequence again.

 Turn the printer on and place it in the OFF LINE
 state (press the "ON LINE" button unless the
 printer is already offline because it has no
 paper in it).

 Hold down the "SELECT" button, keep it held down
 and additionally hold down the "ON LINE" and the
 "PARK/LOAD" buttons. Keep all three held down
 until the LCD display shows a FACTORY INITIAL
 message. Release all three buttons and wait for
 the LCD display to show the OFF LINE message.

 Hold down the "SAVE" button, keep it held down
 and additionally hold down the "ON LINE" button.
 Keep both of them held down until the LCD display 
 shows a BUFFER INITIAL message. Release both
 buttons and wait for the LCD display to show the
 OFF LINE message.

 Press "MENU", "JUMP" and then "MENU" - the LCD
 display should say MAC CTRL DEFN MAC.

 Press "SELECT" then "SAVE" - the LCD display
 should say LOADED MACRO 1.

 Press "MENU", "SELECT", "SELECT" again and "SAVE"
 - the LCD display should say EMLATION IBM.

 Press "JUMP" five times - the LCD display should
 say CHR TBL CODE PG.

 Press "SELECT", "SELECT" again and "SAVE" - the
 LCD display should say CODE PG MULTI.

 Press "SAVE" and "SAVE" again - the LCD display
 should say SAVED MACRO 1.

 Wait for the LCD display to say OFF LINE, and
 then switch the printer off. The printer will now
 configure itself correctly whenever you switch it
 on.

The steps to configure the Citizen Swift 24 if you
do have the colour  upgrade fitted are given
below. If at any stage you think you have made a
mistake, switch the printer off and start the
sequence again.

 Turn the printer on and place it in the OFF LINE
 state (press the "ON LINE" button unless the
 printer is already offline because it has no
 paper in it).

 Hold down the "SELECT" button, keep it held down
 and additionally hold down the "ON LINE" and the
 "PARK/LOAD" buttons. Keep all three held down
 until the LCD display shows a FACTORY INITIAL
 message. Release all three buttons and wait for
 the LCD display to show the OFF LINE message.

 Hold down the "SAVE" button, keep it held down
 and additionally hold down the "ON LINE" button.
 Keep both of them held down until the LCD display 
 shows a BUFFER INITIAL message. Release both
 buttons and wait for the LCD display to show the
 OFF LINE message.

 Press "MENU", "JUMP" and then "MENU" - the LCD
 display should say MAC CTRL DEFN MAC.

 Press "SELECT" then "SAVE" - the LCD display
 should say LOADED MACRO 1.

 Press "MENU", "SELECT", "SELECT" again and "SAVE"
 - the LCD display should say EMLATION IBM.

 Press "JUMP" four times - the LCD display should
 say INSTALL RIBBON.

 Press "SELECT", "SELECT" again and "SAVE" - the
 LCD display should say RIBBON COLOUR.

 Press "JUMP" - the LCD display should say CHR TBL
 CODE PG.

 Press "SELECT", "SELECT" again and "SAVE" - the
 LCD display should say CODE PG MULTI.

 Press "SAVE" and "SAVE" again - the LCD display
 should say SAVED MACRO 1.

 Wait for the LCD display to say OFF LINE, and
 then switch the printer off. The printer will now
 configure itself correctly whenever you switch it
 on.

Having configured your printer in this manner, it
will no longer work with Ace Computing's
!PrinterJX printer driver. This is because the
printer now defaults to IBM mode, whereas the Ace
driver expects it to be in Epson mode when using
the Epson LQ-360 compatible graphics resolutions.
There are two ways around this. The first is to
use the Citizen Swift 24 control panel to manually
switch it to Epson emulation mode. The second is
to modify the PrData file inside !PrinterJX to
include the control sequence to switch to Epson
emulation mode in the job_prologue. The control
sequence required is <27>~5<0>. An example PrData
file entry for !PrinterJX using this is given
below:

.............................................................

printer_name:    Citizen Swift 24 (180 by 180 dpi)
printer_number:  28

pxres:          180                     ; dots per inch
pyres:          180
pxres_halftone: 180/8
pyres_halftone: 180/8

dump_depth:     24                      ; 24 pin printer
job_prologue:   "<27>~5<0>"             ; Select Epson Emulation
line_prologue:  "<27>*<39>"             ; 180 DPI graphics
line_epilogue:  "<27>$<0><0><27>J<24>"  ; move down 24/180 inch
job_epilogue:   "<27>@"                 ; Reset printer

.............................................................


You now need to set the VTOP for the printer, such
that auto paper feed of cut sheets feeds as little
of the paper past the print head as possible.
Switch the printer on, feed a sheet of paper into
it, and put the printer ONLINE. Now hold down the
LF/FF key for 1 second or more until the LCD
display says OFF LINE VTOP 0. Hold down the LF/FF
button. This will cause the paper to feed
backwards and the 0 in the display will count
down. On most printers it will stop at -26, when
the LCD will say OFF LINE VTOP -26. This should
correspond to a "Paper Y offset:" of 10 mm, which
is what the Citizen.Swift-24 printer definition
file is set up for. Some printers will let you set
the VTOP further back by pressing LF/FF again and
holding it down. If you do this you will need to
use the "Printers.Top_Left" file in conjunction
with !PrintEdit to change the "Paper Y offset:".
Having set the VTOP to -26 (or some other number),
press the SAVE button. The LCD display will say
SAVE?, at which point you should press the SAVE
button again to store the setting. Wait until the
LCD display says ON LINE. The printer is now fully
configured.
