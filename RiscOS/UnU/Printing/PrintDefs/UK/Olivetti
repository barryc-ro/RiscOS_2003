JP 360
------
The Olivetti JP360 is compatible with the Hewlett-
Packard DJ500C printer, so you can use the printer
definition file 'HP.DJ500C'.

Because the JP360 can be fitted with either colour
or black cartridges, you should set the !Printers
configuration (see User Guide) appropriately:

 - When a black cartridge is fitted, use only the
   Mono or Grey options.
 - When a colour cartridge is fitted, use only the
   256, 32 thousand or 16 million colour options.

If the wrong printer configuration is used, the
printer will flash its Online and Form Feed lights
when you attempt to print.
