RISC OS 3.70:

 - Feeds directory required by some PostScript PDFs
 - Paper directory required by PostScript PDFs

 - both are currently installed in disc build
   (in !Boot.Choices.Printers.ps)

 - Paper is just a copy of Paper in Manager source; should
   probably be installed as ROM resource, but wasn't (ROM
   frozen now)

 - Feeds not held in manager source currently; arguably
   could be ROM'd as well
