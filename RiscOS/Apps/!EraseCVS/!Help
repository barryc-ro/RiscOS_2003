!EraseCVS
---------

Run it.
Drop a directory on it.
Watch those troublesome CVS directories and /cvstag files disappear.


Comments to me please.

Update

  EraseCVS will now ask you if it detects the directory dropped on 
  resides on NFS.  This should hopefully avoid people accidentally
  destroying their real CVS tags.
  
  Can now also be used from the command line.  Ensure !EraseCVS has
  been seen by the filer and then you can use 'EraseCVS' in your
  !MkClean or whatever, or 'EraseCVS adfs::4.$.Project' etc.
