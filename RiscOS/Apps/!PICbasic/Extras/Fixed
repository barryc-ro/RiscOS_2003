Bug fix details since V1.12 - ASSEMBLY
---------------------------
Expressions involving brackets previously needed a dummy space if the last
thing in the bracket was a user defined variable,eg.
 MOVLW#(someconstant*1.25)     was fine
 MOVLW#(1.25*someconstant)     caused a 'Missing )' error
 MOVLW#(1.25*someconstant )    was fine

Binary numbers which are longer than the PIC program bus width (or zero length)
cause 'Too big' and 'Mistake' errors respectively now as opposed to just 
warnings.

Use of GOTO <constant> is now supported as well as GOTO <label>.

Bug fix details since V1.12 - FOR/NEXT LOOPS
---------------------------
FOR...NEXT loops can be nested up to 8 deep,any deeper and a 'Too many FORs' 
error will be issued.
