MANUAL FOR !PICbasic (Application)

This file describes the program PICbasic which assembles a tokenised BASIC
program containing PIC mnemonics into a binary file ready to be programmed 
straight onto a chip,or tested in a simulator.
The manual and software are (C)1997 SPROW

INSTRUCTIONS-
To start using !PICbasic you should:
 - copy the application !PICbasic from the program diskette,and keep the 
   original somewhere safe.
 - then double click on its icon to start working

Assembly is simply a matter of CHAINing the source file just as you would do
in BASIC (or LOADing then RUNing if you prefer).

If the source code program contains any unsupported BASIC commands then these 
will halt assembly with a 'Command not supported' error - see the text files 
in the 'Extras' directory for more details.

Try typing "HELP" or "HELP." for some online help.

If memory is short then a 'Crunched' version is supplied,which should be 
swapped in place of "!RunImage" which will free up some more memory.

PICSUITE USERS-
Users of PICsuite will probably find it easier to use !PICbasic by dragging the
file to assemble onto the !PICbasic icon of !PIClauncher and dropping it there.
This will then assemble the code from the familiarity of the RISC OS desktop.

All that is needed is for the filer to have seen !PICbasic.

EXIT MESSAGES-
Each of the error messages below will be accompanied by ' at line xxxx' which
should aid in finding the problem in your text editor.
"Command not supported" - only the commands indicated by HELP. are allowed
"No help available on that topic" - all help details can be shown using HELP.
"File not found" - filing system could not locate the source code
"BPI not specified" - PICbasic expects either '-12bit' or '-14bit' to be 
                      somewhere on its command line
"Unable to open PIC mnemonic templates" - check the file 'PICplates' exists
"Chosen BPI not supported" - the templates file did not contain a template for
                             the PIC program bus width selected
"Bad program" - BASIC files are assumed to start &0D and end &FF
"No program loaded" - you tried to LIST or RUN before loading the source
"No such mnemonic" - implies a non PIC mnemonic was used
"Bad option" - assembler pseudo mnemonic OPT must be < 8
"Too big" - warning from the binary interpretter the number was > 14 bits long
"Silly" - the mnemonic EQU was encountered and PICs can't have in line data
"Missing #" - instruction such as XORLW needs a hash then a numeric after it
"Missing ," - instruction such as MOVF needs two comma separated variables
"Syntax error";"No such variable";"Missing "";"Mistake" - as per BBC BASIC
"No FOR";"No TO";"Bad DIM";"Type mismatch";"Can't Match FOR" - as per BBC BASIC
"STOP";"Too many FORs";"No FN";"The STEP cannot be zero" - as per BBC BASIC

KNOWN PROBLEMS/FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS-
No known problems.
Add multistatements per line support,and checking that file/literal numbers are
in range for the space they have in the opcode.

HISTORY-
See the file 'Extras.Fixed' for more details.
V1.12 GOTO with absolute addresses after are now accepted.Problems encountered
      with binary assignments are errors now not just warnings.
V1.13 END statement no longer reports the line number the END was at
V1.18 Support for 12/14 bit PICs added via command line '-12bit' and '-14bit'
      options,thus opcodes are now held in a seperate file - reducing the size
      of PICbasic itself.The FOR...NEXT stack has been extended to be 8 deep.
      Several OPT formatting/assigning bugs have been resolved.An error caused
      immediately after CHAINing would report an illegal file handle as the 
      error handler attempted to close the source file.
V1.20 Fixed bug in variable substitutor which previously required a space 
      before closing brackets.Small improvements to line parser/lister.
V1.21 Abbreviated versions of direct mode commands can now be used,for example
      typing "Q." is equivalent to "QUIT".
V1.22 Removed some legacy code from BBC Micro version,reworded manual.
