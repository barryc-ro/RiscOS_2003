Changes to logical memory map in RO 3.7:

Area from 31M+64k to 33M previously defined as:


 33M        ---------

            Reserved for fake screen (480K)    2M-64K Private

 31M + 64K  ---------


In RISC OS 3.70 this is now defined as:


 33M        ---------

            Reserved for fake screen (480K)    2M-96K Private

 31M + 96K  ---------

            Reserved for StrongARM support     32K Private

 31M + 64K  ---------


The 32k StrongARM area is used for two 16k data cache cleaner areas,
and must _never_ be accessed for any other purpose. (Note that the
physical space used is 4k at the start of ROM bank 1, ie. at &1000000,
and that IOMD is programmed to give maximum access speed for ROM bank
1). See the source file, Sources.OS_Core.Kernel.s.ARM600, for more
information.

The erosion of the fake screen area is not a problem because the
fake screen actually only needs the space from 32M-480K to 32M+480K.
