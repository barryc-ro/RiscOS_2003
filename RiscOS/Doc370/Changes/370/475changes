RISC OS ROM 4.75 (15 July 1996)
-------------------------------

Changes since RISC OS ROM 4.74 (06 July 1996):


** Kernel 4.75

  - Fix Service_PagesSafe handler in AMBControl, so that it does not die horribly if there is
    an AMB node with 0 pages (eg. can be generated by Pinboard module executing a *pinboard
    on boot up, and not having any backdrop; can also create task windows with 0 wimp slot).
    Symptom is error during screen mode change, and screen image shifted/split from then on.
    (Fixes PAN-00127)

  - default CMOS: fontmax2,fontmax3 now 36pt (was 32); fontmax set to 256k (was off)
                  (36 pt required for smooth banner)


** Desktop 2.52

  - new version that uses template based banner; banner stays up for minimum of 5s, or
    until clicked upon (but this does not delay desktop startup)


** FileSwitch 2.35

  - do SynchroniseCodeAreas after 2nd Service_UKCompression call (ie after any patching and
    unsqueezing), so that we are not reliant on patcher and/or unsqueezer to do this
    (except any synchronising necessary to their internal poking and calling)


** TaskManager 1.04

  -  fix bug with Desktop Boot file save to editor blowing away TaskManager (PAN-00095)
