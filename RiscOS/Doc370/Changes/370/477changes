RISC OS ROM 4.77 (30 July 1996)
-------------------------------

Note that this ROM release identifies itself as version 3.70, because
it is the proposed ROM for release. (4.77 is effectively the source
version). (You distinguish this from 4.76, also marked as 3.70, by
the date.)

Changes since RISC OS ROM 4.76 (24 July 1996):

** Kernel

  - date change only (to 30 July)


** FileSwitch

 - date format fix only


** UnSqueezeAIF

  - date format fix only


** ShareFS 3.40

 - fix bug, revealed by new desktop, that ShareFS used icon value of 0 to mean
   no icons, and icon 0 is valid (new desktop creates a temporary icon, so icon
   0 is freed and can be picked up by ShareFS). Symptom is degenerate copies of
   ShareFS icon, and consequent functional fowl ups.
