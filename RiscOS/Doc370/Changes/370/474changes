RISC OS ROM 4.74 (06 July 1996)
-------------------------------

Changes since RISC OS ROM 4.73 (27 June 1996):


** Kernel 4.74

  - OS_Byte 106 no longer performs a wait for Vsync (fixes PAN-00088)

  - StrongARM POST skip now revised to allow basic video setup to occur; colour is that for
    'warm start', ie. POST not performed (however, colour is typically too brief to see)

  - reset code turns on I cache and fast core clock for StrongARM at beginning of MemSize
    routine (near MemSizeIOMD label in s.ARM600); boot speed-up

  - reset code now makes the logical representation of RAM physical space bufferable
    temporarily, during the ClearPhysRAM routine (all ARMs). This is a big speed-up for
    StrongARM, which does not burst write to non bufferable space. Also, the routine
    now does 8-register STMs instead of 4-register.


** Debugger 1.48

  - version update (oversight in RISC OS 4.73)


** Desktop 2.51

  - clear bits 23,22 (poll word related) in R0 for Wimp_Poll near ClearScreen (possible
    cause of spurious error on a cancel of a failed disc boot; eg. !Boot missing)


** FSLock 1.18

  - perform OS_SynchroniseCodeAreas after code decryption (fixes PAN-00080)


** SharedCLibrary 4.84

  - make C stack backtracing for postmortems work with ARM architecture 4 (PC+8 stores)

  - fix C _swi(x) veneer bugs present at least since RISC OS 3.60
      1) use of R0 as an output register, plus a _swi() return value (PAN-00085)
      2) use of R0 as an output register, plus a block parameter     (PAN-00091)


** ShareFS 3.39

  - version update (previous oversight)
