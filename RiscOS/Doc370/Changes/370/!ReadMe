Clearly, this is not like unwindable, change-logged
source info, but is better than nothing.

A useful tip in looking at the source, is that StrongARM
changes should all be flagged with either a comment or
assembler flag "StrongARM". Other changes from released
3.60 are those in the current 3.60 source tree, save for
a few functional changes in 3.7 (OS_AMBControl, Networking
etc).

RISC OS 3.7 was sourced as versions 4.71,4.72..4.77
during testing (4.77 is release 3.70).
