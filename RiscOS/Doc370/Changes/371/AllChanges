RISC OS 3.71 (02 Jan 1997) 
==========================

Background
----------

RISC OS 3.71 is an update of 3.70 with two main aims:

  1) Support production StrongARM Risc PC
     - make POST operative with StrongARM
     - remove need for ROM patch to workaround STM^ bug

  2) Support A7000+
     - recognise 7500FE and assume 64MHz EDO memory if so

There is a new desktop banner (template/sprite change only) that
replaces the defunct ART logo with the Acorn logo. There are also a
few bug fixes.

RISC OS 3.71 should also work with Risc PC's fitted with ARM 610's or
ARM 710's, and with current A7000's, but this is unlikely to be tested.

RISC OS 3.71 does not support ARM 810.


Changes from RISC OS 3.70 (30 Jul 1996)
---------------------------------------

* UtilityModule 3.71 (Kernel)

    Fix bug that means kernel fails if one or more physical RAM chunks are
    on smaller than 1Mb boundaries (eg. Kryten with 2 Mb on motherboard, but
    not Risc PC).

    Fix STM^ for StrongARM bug (SA110 revision < 3), so that ROM patch is
    not required.

    Add in code to support POST for StrongARM on Risc PC.

    Add "RO371Timings" flag and set true - this disables all autospeed
    ROM stuff, and makes TimeCPU routine etc. check for 3 cases, and
    assume memory speed etc accordingly:

       if IOMD   (Risc PC) assume 32 MHz bus
       if 7500   (A7000)   assume 32 MHz bus
       if 7500FE (A7000+)  assume 64 MHz bus, EDO RAM

    In all cases, ROM access timing of 5-3 cycles, 32 MHz equivalent is
    set (ie. 5-3 cycle, half speed if 7500FE).
    Note that memory speed for 7500FE is kept at 32 MHz (/2 set in 320003c)
    until after main kernel boot, to avoid problems with POST and power-on
    key detect.

    Add code to make printed banner sensitive to 7500,7500FE (rather than
    just printing 710).

    Change power-on-default CMOS year from 95 to 97 (CMOS location 0x80)


* FileSwitch 2.36

    Fix STM^ for StrongARM bug (SA110 revision < 3), so that ROM patch is
    not required.


* PS2Driver 0.18

    Recognise 7500FE as Morris-style hardware (as well as 7500 as before).


* ADFS 3.28 

    Implement Simon Proven's fix for ADFSbuffers <> 0 and >2G disc.


* FPEmulator 4.07

    Fix STM^ for StrongARM bug (SA110 revision < 3), so that ROM patch is
    not required.


* ParallelDeviceDriver

    Implement fix for HP printers (as in 3.70 ROMPatch).


* SoundDMA 1.53

    Version 1.53 now in ROM (supplied on disc for RISC OS 3.70).


* TaskWindow 0.55

    Fix STM^ for StrongARM bug (SA110 revision < 3), so that ROM patch is
    not required.


* SharedCLibrary 4.85

    Fix STM^ for StrongARM bug (SA110 revision < 3), so that ROM patch is
    not required.


* PDriverDP 4.42

    Implement fix for interrupt hole while dropping into user mode (fix as in
    !Printers 1.53 update kit).


* PDriverPS 4.42

    Version change only (tracks PDriverDP).



RISC OS 3.71 (17 Jan 1997) 
==========================

Changes from RISC OS 3.71 (02 Jan 1997)
---------------------------------------

* FPEmulator 4.08
    Removed support for ARM2 silicon bug.
    Added SWIs FPEMulator_DeactivateContext and FPEMulator_ActivateContext for system use (by TaskWindow).

* TaskWindow 0.56
    Call FPEMulator_DeactivateContext then FPEMulator_ActivateContext on task switches to prevent
    spurious illegal instruction errors (see source comments for details). Fixes MED-05167.


RISC OS 3.71 (21 Jan 1997)
==========================

Changes from RISC OS 3.71 (17 Jan 1997)
---------------------------------------

* Kernel
    Add code to kick VCO in early kernel reset (if running on 7500/7500FE). This is intended to
    remove need for resistor fit on fast A7000's.



Disc build 3.71 (16-Jan-97)
===========================

Changes from preliminary 3.7 disc build (equals 3.6 production build with
3.7 release update).


* !Boot.Choices.Boot.PreDesk

    1) Remove BandLimit obey file
    2) Change Configure.!Run obey file and add Configure.BandLimit app


* Configure

    Screen configuration picks up and uses Alias$VIDCBandLimit (set by
    new BandLimit app. run in Predesk.Configure), rather than try to run
    BandLimit obey file in Predesk (now removed).


* SlideShow

    Change decision on using ChangeFSI from VRAM not present to
    suitable mode not available according to OS_CheckModeValid (hence
    allows decent use in 800x600x16bpp on A7000+)


* Videos

    Update !RunImages in !Warning and HiRes.!Warning to allow for higher
    bandwidth aviable in 7500FE case. [ReadMe info needs updating - not done yet.]


RISC OS 3.71 (04 Feb 1997)
==========================

Changes from RISC OS 3.71 (21 Jan 1997)
---------------------------------------

* Kernel 3.71
    In s.vdu.vdudriver, stop ComputeModuli stalling VCO when deciding to use
    ref clock, since this recreates the VCO start problem later.

* RTCAdjust 0.05
    Fix bug where RTCAdjust accidentally asks for two CallEvery's in quick succession
    (once on init, once on Service_Reset). This means that it potentially injects
    large variations in centisecond timing, to correct an error seen in the very
    short interval (then does no recorrection for the 1 hour interval).

* SerialDeviceDriver 0.35
    Fix interrupt on-then-off for StrongARM (5 NOPs to allow for synchroniser
    pipeline).

* Filer_Action 0.40
    Fixes for > 2Gb discs, from SProven


RISC OS 3.71 (05 Feb 1997)
==========================

Changes from RISC OS 3.71 (04 Feb 1997)
---------------------------------------

* Filer_Action 0.41
    Further fixes for > 2Gb discs, from SProven



RISC OS 3.71 (19 Feb 1997)
==========================

Changes from RISC OS 3.71 (05 Feb 1997)
---------------------------------------

* Kernel 3.71 (19 Feb 1997)
    ARM810 support added to source code, but switched out. Binary same as
    previous release except for date change.

* ARM 0.12
    ARM810 support added to source code, but switched out. Accidental
    setting of reserved bits during use of special StrongARM *cache syntax 
    corrected. Behaviour unaffected.

* ADFS 3.29
    ARM810 support added to source code, but switched out. Binary same as
    previous release except for date and version change.

* SoundDMA 1.54
    ARM810 support added to source code, but switched out. Binary same as
    previous release except for date and version change.

* Wimp 3.69
    Fix four bugs in Wimp_TransferBlock as follows:
    Bug since  Description    
         3.70  PAN-00249 "Wimp_TransferBlock scrambles application memory"
               Problem is page(s) left mapped in above current application;
               often harmless unless several TransferBlock's occur without
               an intervening Poll.
               eg. Load DataPower 1.51, load (say) Examples.Birthdays and
               type F7, then DataPower crashes.
         3.50  Transfer crashes if forced to map current task out because
               there is not enough spare Application space.
         3.50  Transfer crashes if transfer is large (> 7 Mb) and there is
               less than transfer_size spare Application space.
         3.50  Transfer fails or crashes if source or destination is a
               Dynamic Area at logical address 2G or greater.
