Log of changes from RO 3.70 to RO 3.71
======================================

  - Kernel
    In ClearPhysRAM routine, fix bug that means kernel fails if one or
    more physical RAM chunks are on smaller than 1Mb boundaries (eg.
    Kryten with 2 Mb on motherboard, but not Risc PC).
    Look for "MJS bug fix (since 3.70)" comments in source.

  - Kernel
    In TimeCPU, fix bug in code that decides to skip timing calculation
    for Risc PC.
    Look for "MJS bug fix (since 3.70)" comments in source.
    [In fact, compiled out if RO371Timings true - see below]

  - Kernel and PS2Driver
    Change all instances of IOMD id check to check for Risc PC id
    (and assume non Risc PC is Morris like), rather than for Morris.
    This allows 7500 and 7500FE to be recognised as Morris like. Each
    change consists of changing the two immediate constants for the
    id checks, and reversing the sense of the following decision.
    Changes not flagged explicitly, but look for "IOMD_ID0" in the
    source.

  - Kernel
    Change ROM speed timing pokes to NOPs (slowest possible speed
    remains, and it is assumed that !Boot will sort out what to
    do). Note that this will mean slowest speed on Risc PC too; may
    need to consider making this sensitive to Risc PC/Kryten.
    Look for "MJS fast Kryten change" in source (s and TestSrc).
    [Now superseded by RO371Timings change (see below) and removed]

  - Kernel
    Add in code to support POST for StrongARM (but not fully working
    for ARM 8; one beleived problem is that ROM checksum hits problem
    of ARM 8 aborting on 26 read of processor vectors).
    Look for "StrongARM_POST" flag in source (s and TestSrc).

  - Kernel
    Add "RO371Timings" flag and set true - this disables all autospeed
    ROM stuff, and makes TimeCPU routine etc. check for 3 cases, and
    assume memory speed etc accordingly:
       if IOMD   (Risc PC) assume 32 MHz bus
       if 7500   (A7000)   assume 32 MHz bus
       if 7500FE (A7000+)  assume 64 MHz bus, EDO RAM
    In all cases, ROM access timing of 5-3 cycles, 32 MHz equivalent is
    set (ie. 5-3 cycle, half speed if 7500FE).
    Note that memory speed is kept at 32 MHz (/2 set in 320003c) until
    after main kernel boot, to avoid problems with POST and power-on
    key detect.

  - Kernel, FileSwitch, FPEmulator, TaskWindow, SharedCLibrary
    Fix STM^ for StrongARM SA110 (revision < 3) bug in ROM. (So that patch
    not required). Flagged with "SASTMhatbroken" flag in source. (Old
    flags and NOPs removed - SAnaffsilicon and SAUBxferbroken.)
    The thinking here is to fix it in ROM, in same way as 3.70 patches. If
    not fixed in ROM, ROM would really have to have NOPs anyway, to allow
    reasonable in-line patch. Also, a new ROMPatch would be required (and
    Charles says, this would have to support 3.70 and 3.71).
    ** Needs proper testing **

  - Kernel
    Add code to make printed banner sensitive to 7500,7500FE (rather than
    just printing 710). Flagged with "MorrisIDString" in source.

  - Desktop, Wimp, Messages
    Change Template and Sprite resources to replace ART logo in desktop banner
    with Acorn logo. Probably needs further stylistic revision.

  - Parallel
    Implement fix for HP printers (as in 3.70 ROMPatch)
    ** Needs proper testing **

  - PDriverDP [PDriverPS]
    Implement fix for dropping into user mode (as in !Printers 1.53 update kit).
    PDriverPS version updates in tandem.
    ** Needs proper testing **

  - ADFS
    Implement Simon Proven's fix for ADFSbuffers <> 0 and >2G disc.
    ** Needs proper testing **

  - Kernel
    set ASTCR reg (0x32000cc) to 0x80 if 7500FE (i/o timing for fast memory
    clock). This is set with final memory speed.

  - Kernel
    Change power-on-default CMOS year from 95 to 97 (CMOS location 0x80)

  - Switcher
    Change template for proginfo to have copyright date 97.

^^^^ 3.71 release 1 (02 Jan 97)

  - Configure (disc build)
    change VIDCbandwidth limit setting after reinstantiating ScreenModes
    module, to pick up and use Alias$VIDCBandLimit (set by new BandLimit
    app. run in Predesk.Configure), rather than try to run BandLimit
    obey file in Predesk (now removed).
    (Look for "UseVIDCBandLimitAlias in source)

  - SlideShow (disc build)
    Change decision on using ChangeFSI from VRAM not present to
    suitable mode not available according to OS_CheckModeValid (hence
    allows decent use in 800x600x16bpp on A7000+)
    (See bas.!RunImage, added FNmodepossible)

  - Boot.PreDesk (disc build)
    1) Remove BandLimit obey file from Sources.SystemRes.Boot.RO360Hook.Boot.PreDesk
    2) Change Configure.!Run obey file and add Configure.BandLimit app. Add
       source for BandLimit in Sources.SystemRes.Boot.Source.BandLimit.
    3) Add new version of ROMPatch (for 3.70) in Sources.SystemRes.Boot.Source.ROMPatch
       (old versions moved into directory ROMPatchO).
    5) Update Sources.SystemRes.PartNumber.UK.HardDisc.PartNumber for 3.71 disc build

  - ARMovie (disc build)
    add extras to Sources.SystemRes.ARMovie.Resources for install (Decomp7.BatchComp,
    MovingLine.BatchComp, Decomp17, Shapes.Bounce, Shapes.Film, shapes.FilmB, Shapes.ZoomUp).

  - !Patch (disc build)
    add Advance to set of known patches

  - AREncode (disc build)
    add this to Sources.ARENcode, installing into $.Replay in hard disc build.

  - Video (disc build)
    update readmes and put new !warning in hires (to bring up to date
    with production disc build)

  - FPEmulator
    ARM2safe flag set to NOT Arm600 (disabled support for ARM2 bug)
    SWIs FPEMulator_DeactivateContext and FPEMulator_ActivateContext added for system use (TaskWindow)

  - TaskWindow
    Call FPEMulator_DeactivateContext then FPEMulator_ActivateContext on task switches to prevent
    spurious illegal instruction errors (see source comments for details). Fixes MED-05167.

  - Videos (disc build)
    Update !RunImages in !Warning and HiRes.!Warning to allow for higher bandwidth in 7500FE
    case. [ReadMe info needs updating - not done yet.]


^^^^ 3.71 release 2 (17 Jan 97)

  - Kernel
    Add code to kick VCO in early kernel reset (if running on 7500/7500FE). This is intended to
    remove need for resistor fit on fast A7000's.
    (Look for 'VCOstartfix' in source)


^^^^ 3.71 release 3 (21 Jan 97) 


   - BuildSys.SoftLoad (utility)
     Fix bug where softload can sometimes hang-up trying to find a slot for softload code.
     (Now version 1.01; version 1.00 code in c.softload_1)

   - Sources.SystemRes.InetSetup (disc build)
     Import updated InetSetup from KBracey (supports latest Acorn shipped network card)

   - SystemRes.Boot.Configure.Monitors (disc build)
     Update AKF91 file, changes as follows:
     1) add 800x600x56Hz mode from Kevin Lingley version (restores 800x600 capability
        in 16m colours with 2M VRAM and in 32k colours with 1M VRAM or on A7000+)
     2) replace 1024x768 modes (60Hz and 70Hz) with those from Kevin Lingley version
        (unstable picture on old values in 32k colours with test AKF91)

  - HForm (disc build)
    Update to version 2.47 (from Black source)


  - RTCAdjust
    Fix bug where RTCAdjust accidentally asks for two CallEvery's in quick succession
    (once on init, once on Service_Reset). This means that it potentially injects
    large variations in centisecond timing, to correct an error seen in the very
    short interval (then does no recorrection for the 1 hour interval).
    See SingleCallEveryFix in source.

  - Serial
    Fix interrupt on-then-off for StrongARM (5 NOPs to allow for synchroniser
    pipeline). See StrongARM in source.

  - FilerAction
    Fixes for > 2Gb discs (signed ints become unsigned ints), from SProven

  - Kernel
    in s.vdu.vdudriver, stop ComputeModuli stalling VCO when deciding to use
    ref clock, since this recreates the VCO start problem later. See
    VCOstartfix in code.

^^^^ 3.71 release 4 (04 Feb 97) 

  - FilerAction
    Further fixes for > 2Gb discs (signed ints become unsigned ints), from
    SProven (not quite right last time)


^^^^ 3.71 release 5 (05 Feb 97) 


   - Apply ARM810 support changes to source. Modules affected:
       Kernel
       ARM
       ADFS
       Econet
       Sound0 (SoundDMA)
     Each module's support controlled by "ARM810support" build flag.

   - Set "ARM810support" {FALSE} in each of the above modules. Verified that this
     builds the same binary modules (Kernel,ARM etc) as for 3.71 (05 Feb 97),
     apart from date and version changes.

   - ARM
     Fix small bug with special *cache syntax (pseudo bits not cleared before
     being used in MCR). Look for "set FALSE to be as for 3.71 05 Feb" in
     comment in s.Cache.

   - Wimp
    Fix four bugs in Wimp_TransferBlock as follows:
    Bug since  Description    
         3.70  PAN-00249 "Wimp_TransferBlock scrambles application memory"
               Problem is page(s) left mapped in above current application;
               often harmless unless several TransferBlock's occur without
               an intervening Poll.
               eg. Load DataPower 1.51, load (say) Examples.Birthdays and
               type F7, then DataPower crashes.
         3.50  Transfer crashes if forced to map current task out because
               there is not enough spare Application space.
         3.50  Transfer crashes if transfer is large (> 7 Mb) and there is
               less than transfer_size spare Application space.
         3.50  Transfer fails or crashes if source or destination is a
               Dynamic Area at logical address 2G or greater.

^^^^ 3.71 release 6 (19 Feb 97) 


  - HForm (disc build)
    Update to version 2.48 (from Black source)

  - Verify (disc build)
    Update to version 1.02 with !RunImage (from SProven email; version number
    not updated in sent version, so incremented by mjs).

  - BookWorm (disc build)
    Collected from AH and added to Source.Apps (Installs in $.Manuals on target
    disc)

  - System (disc build)
    Added modules 310.Modules.Network.URL.File and 310.Modules.Network.URL.URL
    (Bookworm support)

  - backdrop textures (disc build)
    Replace ART texture with Acorn texture, courtesy of Ali.

  - Sources.SystemRes.Boot (disc build)
    Source for new version of ROMPatches placed in Source.ROMPatch, and the
    new ROMPatches themselves RO360Hook.Boot.PreDesk (so that disc build
    supports 3.70 and installs patches appropriately).

* (12 Mar 97) incorporate minor disc build changes made for production
  machines (StrongARM Risc PCs; A7000FE's to come later):

  - BookWorm (disc build)
    Import latest HTML User Guide to Sources.Apps.BookWorm.Manual
    Update Sources.Apps.BookWorm.Manual.ReadMe.
    Add Sources.Apps.BookWorm.Manual.AppNote (3.7 app note)
    Update Sources.Apps.BookWorm.Resources.UK.User.HotList
    Update makefile appropriately

  - !Boot (disc build)
    change Sources.SystemRes.Boot.RO360Hook.Boot.PreDesk.Configure.NoVRAM to
    default to 256 colours

  - !System (disc build)
    add SSound module (version that is StrongARM compatible) to
    Sources.SystemRes.System.Modules (maybe this should be 310.Modules or
    whatever, but this is where it is for production).

  - PartNumber (disc build)
    update Sources.SystemRes.PartNumber.UK.HardDisc.PartNumber to -02
