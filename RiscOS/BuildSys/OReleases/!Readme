SrcList contains the list of source components to be included in
ChangeLogs - update this file as new components are included in releases.
The version files for the 'BASE' and 'PREVIOUS' releases will need
to be updated as well - list the version as 'None'.

To create a ChangeLog for a new release
---------------------------------------

1) Decide on a Release name e.g. 430
   Create a directory with this name and update the Makefile
   setting 'CURRENT' to the same name. Also update 'PREVIOUS'
   and 'BASE' in the Makefile as appropriate. BASE should
   be set to the last major release.

2) Log-on to the Black SrcFiler project (mount name riscos_bl).

3) Double-click on !Mk
   This will generate a versions file for the Release using
   the latest versions of components checked into the SrcFiler.
   The ChangeLog and NewLog files will then be created in the
   new release directory.
   If the 'BASE' and 'PREVIOUS' releases are the same, then
   the contents of ChangeLog and NewLog will be the same.
