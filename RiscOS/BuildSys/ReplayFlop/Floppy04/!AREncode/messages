HprogInfo:This \w shows information about the AREncode application.

Hcvtwin:This is the Movie setup \w.|mIt allows you to specify how the input file is used.
Hcvtwin0:\Srestore the default Movie setup options.
Hcvtwin1:\Sto cancel any changes you've made to the Movie setup options.
Hcvtwin2:\Sregister the changes you've made to the Movie setup options.
Hcvtwin14:This icon shows the frame rate of the uncompressed movie.
Hcvtwin16:\Senter the frame rate divisor for the compressed movie.
Hcvtwin20:\Senter the number of frames per chunk to use. A higher value means more memory is needed to decompress. A lower value means the movie may be more difficult to play on a slow machine.
Hcvtwin26:\Sset a position within the file from which to start compression.
Hcvtwin26S:\Sstart compression from the beginning of the file.
Hcvtwin27:\Senter a start position (in frames) within the file.
Hcvtwin31:\Sstore working files with a numeric prefix.
Hcvtwin31S:\Sstore working files with no numeric prefix.
Hcvtwin32:\Senter the numeric prefix for working files.
Hcvtwin35:\Sjoin the compressed movie with key frames.
Hcvtwin35S:\Sjoin the compressed movie without key frames.
Hcvtwin24:This icon shows the total number of frames in the movie.

Hedithdr:This is the main AREncode \w.|mYou can start or continue compression and joining from here.|mYou can also change the details stored with the movie, and its helpful sprite.
Hedithdr0:\Scontinue the compression from the last Check Point.
Hedithdr2:\Sstart compressing the ARMovie file.
Hedithdr1:\Sjoin the compressed chunks of video data and the sound data into a new ARMovie file.
Hedithdr21:Drag a sprite here to use it as the helpful sprite for the movie.
Hedithdr9:\Senter the description of the movie.
Hedithdr10:\Senter the date of compression and copyright details for the movie.
Hedithdr11:\Senter author details for the movie.
Hedithdr12:\Scompress in single-tasking mode. This will allow you to see the frames as they are compressed. Press the space bar to pause the compression.
Hedithdr12S:\Scompress in multi-tasking mode.
Hedithdr14:\Senter the screen mode to use during compression (must be at least 256 colours).
Hedithdr23:\Sdelete working files automatically after a movie has been joined and saved.
Hedithdr23S:\Sdisable automatic deletion of working files.

Hcompress:This is the Configure compressor \w.|mIt allows you to choose which compressor to use and configure the size and quality of the movie.
Hcompress0:\Srestore the default compression options.
Hcompress1:\Sclose the \w and cancel any changes you've made.
Hcompress2:\Suse the compression options as shown.
Hcompress33:This icon shows which compressor is currently selected.

Hcompress32:\Soutput key frames along with the compressed data.
Hcompress32S:\Sdisable output of key frames.
Hcompress7:\Screate a movie with a fixed quality value.
Hcompress8:\Screate a movie with a fixed frame size.
Hcompress9:\Screate a movie with a fixed frame size, calculated according to the specification of the playback device.
Hcompress11:\Senter the device latency in seconds.
Hcompress16:\Senter the device data rate.
Hcompress20:Click \s if double buffers will be used on playback (requires more memory but allows larger frame size).
Hcompress20S:Click \s if only single buffers will be used on playback.
Hcompress21:\Suse a faster (but lower quality) matching algorithm for adjusting frame quality.
Hcompress21S:\Suse the default (slow) matching algorithm for adjusting frame quality.
Hcompress22:\Slimit the frame size produced to that which can be decompressed by an 8MHz ARM2 machine.
Hcompress22S:\Sput no limit on the frame size produced.
Hcompress24:\Senter the quality factor for the compressed movie.
