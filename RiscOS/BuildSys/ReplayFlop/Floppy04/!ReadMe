This disc contains updated versions of the compression tools supplied with
the Acorn Replay Starter Kit.  The updated versions allow them to operate
on StrongARM.

Also, the skeleton !ARMovie directory supplied on this disc contains a
newly developed ARMovie Codec - 'Moving Blocks HQ'.  This is an improvement
over 'Moving Blocks'.

HQ stands for 'High Quality' - the new compressor gives improved quality
of movies for a given data rate over that given by Moving Blocks.  It
provides better coding of new data, and enhanced motion search.

!AREncode and !ARWork should be installed on your hard disc by simply
copying them.

Note that when you install !ARWork, the computer will have 'seen' the
!ARWork on the floppy and will attempt to use this for Replay movies. 
Thus when you have just installed !ARWork, you should double-click on the
newly installed copy to point the relevant system variables at the new
copy.  After a reboot, this will not be necessary again; simply opening
the folder containing !ARWork will suffice.

!ARMovie is a skeleton, containing just the new files to update the
!ARMovie supplied with the RISC OS 3.7 disc installation (first 3
floppies). To add these, open the !Boot.Resources directory (use shift
double-click to open !Boot) and copy !ARMovie from this floppy to
!Boot.Resources.

Purposes of Applications:

!AREncode - desktop movie compression utility
!ARWork   - temporary work directory for ARMovie tools
!ARMovie  - skeleton !ARMovie directory, containing the compressors and
            the new Moving Blocks HQ compressor/player
