              Release version 1.00 of the Rutherford software
              ===============================================

The various directories contain sources for the Replay elements. Each
directory has instructions for making that element.

Codec contains the sources for the moving blocks and moving lines compressor
and decompressor, together with CompLib (the common codec library).

Player contains the uncrunched Player file, and the command file, cx, which
crunches this to produce the final image. This goes in !ARMovie's root
directory.

Library contains the DDE tools used to build the C and assembler sources (ie
AREncode, ARPlayer, Extract, and Join). These are all released tools, though
some were provided as part of developer support, after C release 3.

Uniqueway contains the sources for AREncode and ARPlayer.

Extract contains the sources for Extract. Extract lives in !ARMovie.Tools.

Join contains the sources for Join. Join lives in !ARMovie.Tools.

Images contains the final build, provided so that it possible to verify
that the sources build to the images.
