!ARWork
-------

This is the Acorn Replay Work directory. It acts in much the same way as !Scrap
except that the files within it will tend to be much larger than most
applications' temporary files. Therefore it should be placed on the drive with
the most free space and should be 'seen' by the filer before running any of the
aplications that use it.

Current users of this directory are :-

AREncode:     Creates a directory 'AREncode' and stores the temporary files
              required by the compressor there. May also store files that were
              saved from other applications in here.

ReplayDIY:    Creates a directory ReplayDIY and records movies and sound files
              into a file called 'DIYFile'.
Empire:       Creates a directory 'Empire' and stores the working Output file
              as well as files that have been saved from other applications and
              other temporary files as needed.
EmConvert:    Sub tasks create temporary files here and final Output movie
              is first created here.
