  Details of tools used added



To Make ARPlayer and AREncode
=============================
To make just double-click on !MakeAll.

The following directories must exist:
  Libraries.ARLib.o
  Libraries.DBox.o
  Libraries.File.o
  Libraries.Mem.o
  Libraries.Replay.o
  Libraries.Spr.o
  Libraries.Struc.o
  Libraries.Sys.o
  Libraries.Wimp.o
  ToReplay.o
  ARTools.o

It assumes that amu,aasm,objasm,cc,link,libfile are all present on the Run
path. The makefile for ARPlayer assumes also that link supports the -k
command for removing unused areas. If it doesn't then the !RunImage file
will be unnecessarily large.

ARPlayer is contained within the directory ARTools (for historical reasons).
AREncode is contained within the directory ToReplay (for historical reasons).

They require the various different library files to have been made first,
then individual makefiles will make the !RunImage's and ReplaySupport
module.

--------------
Tools used (these are found in the directory Library)

Link is from the C++ developers evaluation kit. The other tools are from the
DDE Release 2 Beta.

  Link:       Acorn System Linker Version 4.09 Dec 10 1992
  CC:         Norcroft RISC OS ARM C vsn 4.05 [Nov 27 1992]
  LibFile:    Libfile version 4.01 [Nov 27 1992]
  AAsm:       ARM stand alone Macro Assembler Version 2.00
  ObjAsm:     ARM AOF Macro Assembler Version 2.00
  Squeeze:    squeeze vsn 4.01 [Nov 27 1992]
  AMU:        AMU vsn 4.01 [Nov 27 1992]

--------------

The files provided are

  !CleanAll - will remove all object and executeable files
  !MakeAll - will do the !SetPaths, !MakeLibs and then run the
  ARTools.Makefile and ToReplay.Makefile
  !SetPaths - sets up the paths needed for the make.
  Libraries.!MakeLibs - will make just the libraries.
  Libraries.LibComment - some general description of library structure

  ARTools contains the ARPlayer specific source
  ToReplay contains the ARPencode specific source
  Libraries contains the library source

So all you need to do is run !MakeAll. It sets up a a few system variables
which may well clash with any in use on the machine at the time.

--------------

The finished application is ARTools.!ARPlayer, relevant files are

Dummy      (ARMovie) - a dummy ARMovie file to get the version number of Player.

!Boot
!Run       (Obey) - the usual.

!State     (Obey) - This file is run from !Boot and should be empty except
for comments for shipping. On a RISC OS 3.5 machine it will never be written
as the state is written to <Boot$ToBeLoaded>.ARPlayer instead. Thus it is
important that nothing is left in this file.

Template2D (Template)
Templates  (Template) - 2D and 3D template files. I recommend for shipping
with Medusa that the Template2D file is deleted as no other application has
one and the icon set for 2D on old and new machines is different which makes
the 2D arrows look rather odd.

!RunImage  (Absolute) - the usual.

!Sprites   (Sprite) - contains !arplayer and ic_arplayer
!Sprites22 (Sprite) - contains !arplayer,sm!arplayer and ic_arplayer

ReplaySpt  (Module) - the ReplaySupport module.

!Help      (Text) - length help file.

Messages   (Text) - messages/menus/interactive help text. Note that messages
generated by library files are embedded into the library files. They are all
overrideable from the Messages file but are not present in it by default.

After being run and 'Save choices' selected you may find a file !Choices
(text) and !State may be written to. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT !CHOICES IS
REMOVED AND !STATE CLEANED OF ALL BUT COMMENTS. Otherwise some confusion may
result.

The !MakeAll file will do this for you but ARTools.Makefile doesn't.

--------------

ToReplay.!AREncode contains the following files

  !Boot
  !Run
  !Sprites
  !RunImage
  !Help
  Template2D
  Templates
  Messages

Note that AREncode should be shipped with ARWork else it will have nowhere
to put its temporary files.


--------------

Current versions are

!ARPlayer.!RunImage     1.27
!ARPlayer.ReplaySupport 0.03

!AREncode.!RunImage     0.61

--------------

There is documentation on the SWI interface to ReplaySupport in ARTools.txt.SWIinfo.
