softload
--------

'softload' is derived from SoftLoad9, but works with
StrongARM and RISC OS 3.7 (as well as ARM 6/7 and RISC OS
3.5 or 3.6). Now written in C and assembler.

Designed to be placed in a directory !Boot.SoftLoad, with a
4 MB ROM image, called 4MEG, and a line in !Boot.!Run (just
after the setting of Boot$Dir) of the form:

if "<wimp$state>" = "commands" then /<boot$dir>.softload.softload

Note that the boot ROMs that have been used for StrongARM (before
3.7 production ROMs) do not have the UnSqueezeAIF module, so
softload will crash during unsqueeze on StrongARM. Use softloadU
(not squeezed) instead.

full syntax:

  softload [-v|-f] [<filename>]

    -v = verbose
    -f = verbose and fake (do not really load), for testing

    <filename> = name for ROM image
                 if leaf name, directory defaults to <Boot$Dir>
                 if omitted, filename defaults to <Boot$Dir>.4MEG
