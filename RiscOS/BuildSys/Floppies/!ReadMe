Background

This directory contains the code and resources for creating a floppy
release of (part of) the RISC OS disc build. The components are:

  - Archiver
  Code and resources for creating a squashed archive file of the
  disc build, but split to fit on floppies.

  - Installer
  Code and resources to build the installer, !Installer, that sits
  on the first floppy and handles the install to target hard disc.
  This is originated for the RISC OS 3.7 upgrade (with StrongARM),
  so that some of this is tailored for that.

  - Floppy01,Floppy02,Floppy03
  The directories where the built components for the floppies
  are installed (currently, 3 required)


To build

 1) Make sure Hard disc build is up to date (see BuildSys.HardDisc)

 2) Run MkCleanAll

 3) Check Archiver.arcs.arcspec. This file controls what will be
    archived from the hard disc build.

 4) Run Mk in Archiver to make the archiver and the archive chunks.

 5) Look at the output from the archiver (also in arcs.arcstats).
    The information: total size of archive; max object size; may
    need to be transferred to the !Installer build (see 6).

 6) Check Installer.h.params, and see that the relevant parameters
    agree with the information from the archiver (see 5). Also, if
    the archived disc build has changed greatly (either total size
    or number and size of objects), the parameters for estimated
    disc space requirements may need changing. The ADFS target sizes
    versus disc granularity can be checked eg. with !DiscScan.

  7) Run Mk in Installer to remake !Installer

  8) Run MkInstall in this directory to install the complete floppy
     disc resources into Floppy01 etc. Note that the eventual
     floppies will need to be named to agree with the name in
     Installer.h.params, and that ReadMe and AppNote files are
     installed for floppy 1 (see Installer.Resources)
