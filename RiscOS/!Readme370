This file contains additional notes for Build-Masters on the changes
to the build structure introduced for RISC OS 3.7.

  Background
  Rebuilding
  Additional or changed structures (since Black tree) in 3.7
  Omissions in ROM
  Analysis of rebuild variances

Background
----------

The RISC OS 3.7 tree was taken from the Black source; the starting
point is therefore 3.60 release, plus subsequent checked-in changes
before about November 95 (primarily Stork and discless Boot work).

There was no specialist Build-Master for RO 3.7, so some additional
structures added in 3.7 are not yet as neatly integrated as they
could be.

There is no SrcFiler change logging for RO 3.6 -> 3.7. The 3.7
change logging summaries are in Doc370.Changes. StrongARM changes
in the source are flagged with "StrongARM" as a comment or symbol.

A collection of relevant documentation for 3.7 is in Doc370.


Rebuilding
----------

Rebuilding can proceed as in the main Readme, but note that
there is now optional floppy release building (see BuildSys.Floppies
and BuildSys.ReplayFlop).

Note that the disc build is currently set to produce only some
of the standard items (for floppy release only) - change the
components list in BuildSys.HardDisc.Components if required.

You should build on a RISC OS 3.7 (or later) machine. Building
might be possible on 3.5 or 3.6, with the CallASWI support
module loaded (see Sources.Utilities.Patches.CallASWI), but
this has not been tested.

It is advisable to read the whole of this ReadMe before
proceeding.


Additional or changed structures (since Black tree) in 3.7
----------------------------------------------------------

  Apps.!DiscScan
    used to calculate hard disc space requirements for RO 3.7
    disc installer

  BuildSys.Floppies
    source etc. for building the hard disc installation floppies
    (3 of them) for RO 3.7. See BuildSys.Floppies.ReadMe

  BuildSys.ROMrelease
    documentation produced for RO 3.7 ROM release, and some
    code to produce checksums etc for the docs.

  BuildSys.ReplayFlop
    data for floppy 4 (Replay upgrades), and source. See 
    BuildSys.ReplayFlop.Floppy04.!ReadMe for some info

  BuildSys.SoftLoad
    Version of SoftLoad that works with RO 3.7 and StrongARM.
    See BuildSys.SoftLoad.ReadMe.

  Doc370
    a collection of documentation and change history for RO 3.7.

  Library
    Some tools have been updated, to allow operation on StrongARM. See
    Library.!Version for info.

  Sources.Networking.AUN
    new networking stack since 3.6; old stuff in AUNold

  Sources.OS_Core.Desktop.Desktop
    new version for new (template based) banner.

  Sources.OS_Core.Desktop.Wimp
    all application space memory handling now in kernel
    (SWI OS_AMBControl).

  Sources.OS_Core.HWSupport.UnSqzAIF
    new ROM module to support unsqueezing AIFs on StrongARM

  Sources.OS_Core.HWSupport.Sound.NewSound
    source for NewSound utility - required if softloading a
    SoundDMA module (as happened for RO 3.7 disc build).
    See Sources.OS_Core.HWSupport.Sound.NewSound.ReadMe.

  Sources.OS_Core.Kernel.s.AMBControl
    important new part of kernel, supports application space
    for Wimp, and can swap tasks much faster.

  Sources.OS_Core.Video.Render.Fonts.ITable
    new, for blending font manager.

  Sources.OS_Core.Video.Render.Fonts.Manager
    background blending enabled.

  Sources.OS_Core.Video.UserI.Picker
    ColourPicker effectively unwound back to equivalent of version in 3.6 ROM
    (version picked up from Black source had bug PAN-00143). Now contains
    a local version of Support library, since main tree version of Support
    changed and incompatible.

  Sources.Printing
    new PDFs, manager etc, similar to soft release 1.53, but
    now in ROM.

  Sources.SystemRes.Patch
    new module (for disc build) that dynamically patches applications
    for StrongARM. Make does not have proper install or clean; see
    the ReadMe file.

  Sources.SystemRes.Boot.Source.ROMPatch4M
    new version, should work on StrongARM (briefly tested, but
    3.7 has been issued without need for ROMpatches). Old version
    in Sources.SystemRes.Boot.Source.ROMPatch4M.UK.360.

  Sources.SystemRes.InetSetup
    new InetSetup utility (launched from Configure); effectively
    an import, installed by Sources.SystemRes.InetSetup.!MkInstall,
    but the source has been included, in Sources.SystemRes.InetSetup.Source.

  Sources.SystemRes.Patch
    application patcher module (PatchApp) for StrongARM, supplied
    in !Boot.Utils on disc build. Make not fully integrated; if
    source is changed, rebuilt module must be copied (see
    Sources.SystemRes.Patch.README).

  Sources.Utilities.Patches
    new set of supplied patches, for RO 3.7 and StrongARM.


Omissions in ROM
----------------

After RO 3.7 was frozen, the following omissions were noted, and
the build structure has been modified to provide soft loaded fixes
(which were issued in the disc build).

  - Printing
    PostScript paper and bin switching files not in ROM; currently
    built to install in !Boot.Choices.Printers; makefile should
    be fixed to install in ROM for next build.

  - SoundDMA module out of date (had not picked up changes in Black
    source version 1.51); new version (1.53) placed in source, and
    Sources.SystemRes.Boot.RO360Hook.Boot.PreDesk.SoundDMA set-up
    to give install on disc. If you wish to remake the 3.7 ROM
    version of SoundDMA, the source is 
    Sources.OS_Core.HWSupport.Sound.Sound0.s.Sound0;151.


Analysis of rebuild variances
-----------------------------

If you rebuild the 3.7 ROM and disc (ie. from clean, but without source
changes), you will not get exact binary as released. This is mainly the
long-standing problem that some components have date strings or date
stamps included. However, the following additional variances occur:

  ROM

  - SoundDMA is version 1.53 (updated after ROM freeze, see above)

  - Printers module has newer date string (frozen before date built into
    message)

  - Messages module tokenization differs (Printers messages differs as
    above)

  Disc

  - exported ansilib differs (minor _swi(x) veneer bug fixes not exported
    before freeze - bugs PAN-00085 and PAN-00091)

  - BootVars utility differs (picks up different exported ansilib as above)

  - Vprotect is squeezed (released unsqueezed)

These are all minor, but are mentioned for the sake of honesty and possibly
to save someone some wasted hours tracking binary differences.
