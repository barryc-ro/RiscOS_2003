#	This is the list of modules to include in the product. The modules
#	should be listed in the order in which they are to be built.
#
#	* Blank lines and comment lines beginning with # are permitted
#
#	* Each module is listed on a separate module definition line
#
#	* Trailing comments on the same line as a module are not allowed
#
#	* Each module definition line should be in the following format,
#	  fields separated by white space; leading and trailing white
#	  space is ignored:
#
#	<module> <version> <required>
#
#	<module>	- the name of the module
#	<version>	- symbolic tag to identify the module version
#	<required>	- either Y or N (usually Y); during product build
#			  non-required modules do not cause the entire build
#			  to fail
