Notes:
	The 'main' script in this directory gets called during the PostBuild
process. It allows project customisations to be performed.

	For instance on the Bethany project we split the main ROM image into
two 16-bit wide parts ready for programming, zip's up all the images and
CRC's and checksums them ready for release.
