	* arcCRC. The CRC for the archive
	* SourcesC. The CRC for the unarchived sources.

* DR
	This directory contains the build archive.
	Files:
	* Betharc. The main archive.
	* arclist. A list of all the files in the main (root) archive.

	Files:
	* !ReadMe. This file.

	* Beth2
		* IM2CRC. The CRC of the second image.
		* IM2ZP.  A zipfile containing the second image.
		* IM2ZPCRC. A CRC of the zipfile containing the second image.
		* log. The log of the build.

the build comprises.
		* RomInfo. The ROM contents listing.
		* SPT20CRC. The CRC of the first split image.
		* SPT20ZIP. The first split image.
		* SPT21CRC. The CRC of the second split image.
		* SPT21ZIP. The second split image.				
	* SIS
		* BETH1SIS. The Software Information Sheet for the first image.
		* BETH2SIS. The Software Information Sheet for the second image.
		* SPT10SIS. The Software Information Sheet for the first half split image of the Beth1 build.
		* SPT11SIS. The Software Information Sheet for the second half split image of the Beth1 build.
		* SPT20SIS. The Software Information Sheet for the first half split image of the Beth2 build.
		* SPT21SIS. The Software Information Sheet for the second half split image of the Beth2 build.

* Tools
	This contains all the tools needed to dearchive the build and
associated items.
	Files:
	* !ReadMe. Instructions on how to dearchive the tools ready for use.
	* Arc. The file used to archive up the build tree.
	* DeArc. This obey file can be used to automatically dearchive the
build. Drag it onto a hard disc in the same directory as the build and double
click on it. For more extensive details, see the file ReadMe.HowBuild.
	* Extract. this file can be used to automatically extarct the 'PERL'
and 'XFILES' tarfiles.
	* Filecmp. A Perl script that can be used to compare two tar output
fils for differences.
	* FileCRC. This is the application required to generate the CRC's
which verify the archive and build. 
	* tar. This is the main application used to archive and dearchive
this build. Please use this version of tar rather than any other you may
have floating about.
	* TarExtend. The utility that was used to produce the archiver and
dearchiver scripts.

directory and type tar -xfv Xfiles
