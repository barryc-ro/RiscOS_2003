CD Contents
===========

	This CD is split into four main sections:

* CRCs
	This directory contains two textfiles, one of which contains the CRC
	for the unarchived sources and one other for the archived sources.  These are
	used by the dearchival script to check the validity of the archive.

	Files:
	* ArcCRC.  The CRC for the archive
	* SourcesC.  The CRC for the unarchived sources.

* DR
	This directory contains the build archive.

	Files:
	* SrcArc.  The main archive.
	* Arclist.  A list of all the files in the main (root) archive.
	* Manual.  A textfile explaining the changes done to the source tree
	  to fit it within tar's 100-character limitation.

* ReadMe
	This directory contains this file and the build instructions.

	Files:
	* !ReadMe.  This file.
	* HowBuild.  In depth build instructions.

* SwImage
	This directory contains a copy of the released image. This copy is
	only for reference and the actual image released to the customer should be
	obtained from the image CD.

	* Binaries.  A list of all the binaries in the image for which we do
	  not have sources.
	* ImageZip.  A zipfile containing the image.

	associated items.

	Files:
	* !ReadMe.  Instructions on how to dearchive the tools ready for use.
	* Arc.  The file used to archive up the build tree.
	* DeArc.  This obey file can be used to automatically dearchive the

	click on it.  For more extensive details, see the file ReadMe.HowBuild.
	* Extract.  this file can be used to automatically extarct the 'PERL'
	  and 'XFILES' tarfiles.
	* Filecmp.  A Perl script that can be used to compare two tar output
	  files for differences.
	* FileCRC.  This is the application required to generate the CRC's
	  which verify the archive and build. 
	* tar.  This is the main application used to archive and dearchive
	  this build.  Please use this version of tar rather than any other you may
	  have floating about.
	* TarExtend.  The utility that was used to produce the archiver and
	  dearchiver scripts.
	* Xfiles.  A tarfile that contains the application !X-Files, which is
	  needed by some build components.  To dearchive it, move in the CLI to it's
	  directory and type tar -xfv Xfiles
	* PerlArc.  A tarfile that contains the !Perl application.
	* SetSysV.  A script that informs the 'dearc' script where the archive
