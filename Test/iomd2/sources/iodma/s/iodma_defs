; notes

; this file defines control structures used to control the sequence of
; DMA transfers which are performed by the DMA test software (see the
; DrawFile 'structs')

; first, the control structure for a DMA channel

	^ 0
iodma_TransferList	#	4	; pointer to current transfer field for this channel
iodma_ScatterPtr	#	4	; pointer to scatter list entry currently being processed
iodma_ChannelState	#	4	; status of transfer at present
iodma_ChannelPtr	#	4	; pointer to control structures for this channel
iodma_ChannelTestPtr	#	4	; pointer to test control structure for this channel
iodma_SzChannelEntry	#	0	; size of this structure

iodma_StopBit		*	&80000000
iodma_LastBit		*	&40000000


; TransferState is a bitfield

; bit(s)    		interpretation

; 0                   	0 = current state : doing buffA
;                     	1 = current state : doing buffB

iodma_ChannelState_BuffA	* 0
iodma_ChannelState_BuffB	* 1

; 1                   	0 = this channel still in use
;                     	1 = this channel completed all tests

iodma_ChannelState_Finished	* 2

; 2                   	0 = no DMA transfer in progress on this channel
;                     	1 = DMA transfer in progress on this channel

iodma_ChannelState_Active	* 4

; 3                   	0 = not in final stage
;		      	1 = in final stage

iodma_ChannelState_Finalising	* 8

; other bits are reserved and set to zero

; next, the control structire for a given transfer

	^ 0
iodma_ScatterList	#	4	; pointer to scatter list for this transfer
iodma_TransferInfo	#	4	; defns for this transfer
iodma_SzTransferEntry	#	0	; size of this thing

; then we have a scatterlist entry:

	^ 0
iodma_BufStart		#	4	; size of this buffer
iodma_BufLen		#	4	; length of transfer (bytes)
iodma_SzScatterEntry	#	0	; size of scatter entry

; test control structure

	^ 0
iodma_TestControl	#	4
iodma_TestLength	#	4
iodma_TestOffset	#	4

; control structure for a given DMA channel

	^ 0
iodma_iocurA		#	4
iodma_ioendA		#	4
iodma_iocurB		#	4
iodma_ioendB		#	4
iodma_iocr		#	4
iodma_iost		#	4

; iodma control register bits

iodma_control_enable		* &20
iodma_width_byte		* 1
iodma_width_half		* 2
