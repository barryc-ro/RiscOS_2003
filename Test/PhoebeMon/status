Phoebe Debug Monitor
--------------------

Based on Tim Dobson's SA1500 monitor, modified by William Turner, then
Richard Leggett.

Work stopped 17/9/98 due to product cancellation.

To run
------
Connect via serial lead to a ASCII terminal emulation.
Switch on the Phoebe. If all goes well, the message 'UART initialised'
should appear on the remote machine. A list of commands can be found by
typing 'HELP'.

Adding extra commands
---------------------
Use the AddCommand macro in the file s.monitor, just before
InteractiveDebug label (currently line 1250). Then create a label of the
form:

Code_MYCOMMAND

Include your code and finish with a branch back to InteractiveDebug.
See s.monitor or s.more_cmds for examples.

Known problems
--------------
  * DOTESTS can fail near the end after the sound codec test has completed.
    Cause unknown.
