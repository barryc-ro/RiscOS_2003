<H1><A NAME="SEC1" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC1">About this manual</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2"></A>

</P>
<P>
Up to this point, one of the weakest parts of CVS
has been the documentation.  CVS is a complex
program.  Previous versions of the manual were written
in the manual page format, which is not really well
suited for such a complex program.

</P>
<P>
When writing this manual, I had several goals in mind:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

No knowledge of RCS should be necessary.

<LI>

No previous knowledge of revision control software
should be necessary.  All terms, such as <EM>revision
numbers</EM>, <EM>revision trees</EM> and <EM>merging</EM> are
explained as they are introduced.

<LI>

The manual should concentrate on the things CVS users
want to do, instead of what the CVS commands can do.
The first part of this manual leads you through things
you might want to do while doing development, and
introduces the relevant CVS commands as they are
needed.

<LI>

Information should be easy to find.  In the reference
manual in the appendices almost all information about
every CVS command is gathered together.  There is also
an extensive index, and a lot of cross references.

<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC2">Checklist for the impatient reader</A></H2>

<P>
CVS is a complex system.  You will need to read
the manual to be able to use all of its capabilities.
There are dangers that can easily be avoided if you
know about them, and this manual tries to warn you
about them.  This checklist is intended to help you
avoid the dangers without reading the entire manual.
If you intend to read the entire manual you can skip
this table.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT>Binary files
<DD>
CVS can handle binary files, but
you must have RCS release 5.5 or later and
a release of GNU diff that supports the <SAMP>`-a'</SAMP>
flag (release 1.15 and later are OK).  You must also
configure both RCS and CVS to handle binary
files when you install them.

Keword substitution can be a source of trouble with
binary files. See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC77">Keyword substitution</A>, for
solutions.

<DT>The <CODE>admin</CODE> command
<DD>
Careless use of the <CODE>admin</CODE> command can cause
CVS to cease working.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC91">admin--Administration front end for rcs</A>, before trying
to use it.

Roland Pesch, Cygnus Support &#60;<TT>pesch@cygnus.com</TT>&#62;
wrote the manual pages which were distributed with
CVS 1.3.  Appendix A and B contain much text that
was extracted from them.  He also read an early draft
of this manual and contributed many ideas and
corrections.

</P>
<P>
The mailing-list <CODE>info-cvs</CODE> is sometimes
informative. I have included information from postings
made by the following persons:
David G. Grubbs &#60;<TT>dgg@think.com</TT>&#62;.

</P>
<P>
Some text has been extracted from the man pages for
RCS.

</P>
<P>
The CVS FAQ by David G. Grubbs has provided
useful material.  The FAQ is no longer maintained,
however, and this manual about the closest thing there
is to a successor (with respect to documenting how to
use CVS, at least).

In the examples, the output from CVS is sometimes
displayed, sometimes not.

<LI>

The input that you are supposed to type in the examples
should have a different font than the output from the

This manual should be clearer about what file
permissions you should set up in the repository, and
about setuid/setgid.

<H1><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC5">What is CVS?</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX12"></A>
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>
<A NAME="IDX14"></A>

</P>
<P>
CVS is a version control system.  Using it, you can
record the history of your source files.

</P>

<P>
For example, bugs sometimes creep in when
software is modified, and you might not detect the bug
until a long time after you make the modification.
With CVS, you can easily retrieve old versions to see
exactly which change caused the bug.  This can
sometimes be a big help.

</P>
<P>
You could of course save every version of every file
you have ever created.  This would
however waste an enormous amount of disk space.  CVS
stores all the versions of a file in a single file in a
clever way that only stores the differences between
versions.

</P>
<P>
CVS also helps you if you are part of a group of people working
on the same project.  It is all too easy to overwrite
each others' changes unless you are extremely careful.
Some editors, like GNU Emacs, try to make sure that
the same file is never modified by two people at the
same time.  Unfortunately, if someone is using another
editor, that safeguard will not work.  CVS solves this problem
by insulating the different developers from each other.  Every
developer works in his own directory, and CVS merges
the work when each developer is done.

</P>
<P>

CVS started out as a bunch of shell scripts written by
Dick Grune, posted to <CODE>comp.sources.unix</CODE> in the volume 6
release of December, 1986.  While no actual code from
these shell scripts is present in the current version
of CVS much of the CVS conflict resolution algorithms
come from them.

</P>
<P>
In April, 1989, Brian Berliner designed and coded CVS.
Jeff Polk later helped Brian with the design of the CVS
module and vendor branch support.

You can get CVS via anonymous ftp from a number of
sites, for instance <TT>prep.ai.mit.edu</TT> in
<TT>`pub/gnu'</TT>.

There is a mailing list, known as <CODE>info-cvs</CODE>,
devoted to CVS.  To subscribe or

send a message to
<CODE>info-cvs-request@prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE>.  Please be
specific about your email address.  As of May 1996,
subscription requests are handled by a busy human
being, so you cannot expect to be added or removed
immediately.  The usenet group
<CODE>comp.software.config-mgmt</CODE> is also a suitable
place for CVS discussions (along with other
configuration management systems).

<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC6">CVS is not...</A></H2>

<P>
CVS can do a lot of things for you, but it does
not try to be everything for everyone.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT>CVS is not a build system.
<DD>
Though the structure of your repository and modules
file interact with your build system
(e.g. <TT>`Makefile'</TT>s), they are essentially
independent.

CVS does not dictate how you build anything.  It
merely stores files for retrieval in a tree structure
you devise.

CVS does not dictate how to use disk space in the
checked out working directories.  If you write your
<TT>`Makefile'</TT>s or scripts in every directory so they
have to know the relative positions of everything else,
you wind up requiring the entire repository to be
checked out.

If you modularize your work, and construct a build
system that will share files (via links, mounts,
<CODE>VPATH</CODE> in <TT>`Makefile'</TT>s, etc.), you can
arrange your disk usage however you like.

But you have to remember that <EM>any</EM> such system is
a lot of work to construct and maintain.  CVS does
not address the issues involved.

Of course, you should place the tools created to
support such a build system (scripts, <TT>`Makefile'</TT>s,
etc) under CVS.

Figuring out what files need to be rebuilt when
something changes is, again, something to be handled
outside the scope of CVS.  One traditional
approach is to use <CODE>make</CODE> for building, and use
some automated tool for generating the depencies which
<CODE>make</CODE> uses.

<DT>CVS is not a substitute for management.
<DD>
Your managers and project leaders are expected to talk
to you frequently enough to make certain you are aware
of schedules, merge points, branch names and release
dates.  If they don't, CVS can't help.

CVS is an instrument for making sources dance to
your tune.  But you are the piper and the composer.  No
instrument plays itself or writes its own music.

<DT>CVS is not a substitute for developer communication.
<DD>
When faced with conflicts within a single file, most
developers manage to resolve them without too much
effort.  But a more general definition of "conflict"
includes problems too difficult to solve without
communication between developers.

CVS cannot determine when simultaneous changes
within a single file, or across a whole collection of
files, will logically conflict with one another.  Its
concept of a <EM>conflict</EM> is purely textual, arising
when two changes to the same base file are near enough
to spook the merge (i.e. <CODE>diff3</CODE>) command.

CVS does not claim to help at all in figuring out
non-textual or distributed conflicts in program logic.

For example: Say you change the arguments to function
<CODE>X</CODE> defined in file <TT>`A'</TT>.  At the same time,
someone edits file <TT>`B'</TT>, adding new calls to
function <CODE>X</CODE> using the old arguments.  You are
outside the realm of CVS's competence.

Acquire the habit of reading specs and talking to your
peers.

<DT>CVS does not have change control
<DD>
Change control refers to a number of things.  First of
all it can mean <EM>bug-tracking</EM>, that is being able
to keep a database of reported bugs and the status of
each one (is it fixed?  in what release?  has the bug
submitter agreed that it is fixed?).  For interfacing
CVS to an external bug-tracking system, see the
<TT>`rcsinfo'</TT> and <TT>`editinfo'</TT> files
(see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC136">Reference manual for the Administrative files</A>).

Another aspect of change control is keeping track of
the fact that changes to several files were in fact
changed together as one logical change.  If you check
in several files in a single <CODE>cvs commit</CODE>
operation, CVS then forgets that those files were
checked in together, and the fact that they have the
same log message is the only thing tying them
together.  Keeping a GNU style <TT>`ChangeLog'</TT>
can help somewhat.

Another aspect of change control, in some systems, is
the ability to keep track of the status of each
change.  Some changes have been written by a developer,
others have been reviewed by a second developer, and so
on.  Generally, the way to do this with CVS is to
generate a diff (using <CODE>cvs diff</CODE> or <CODE>diff</CODE>)
and email it to someone who can then apply it using the
<CODE>patch</CODE> utility.  This is very flexible, but
depends on mechanisms outside CVS to make sure
nothing falls through the cracks.

<DT>CVS is not an automated testing program
<DD>
It should be possible to enforce mandatory use of a
testsuite using the <CODE>commitinfo</CODE> file.  I haven't
heard a lot about projects trying to do that or whether
there are subtle gotchas, however.

<DT>CVS does not have a builtin process model
<DD>
Some systems provide ways to ensure that changes or
releases go through various steps, with various
approvals as needed.  Generally, one can accomplish
this with CVS but it might be a little more work.
In some cases you'll want to use the <TT>`commitinfo'</TT>,
<TT>`loginfo'</TT>, <TT>`rcsinfo'</TT>, or <TT>`editinfo'</TT>
files, to require that certain steps be performed
before cvs will allow a checkin.  Also consider whether
features such as branches and tags can be used to
perform tasks such as doing work in a development tree
and then merging certain changes over to a stable tree
only once they have been proven.

</P>
<P>
CVS stores all files in a centralized
<EM>repository</EM> (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC15">The Repository</A>).

</P>
<P>
The repository contains directories and files, in an
arbitrary tree.  The <EM>modules</EM> feature can be used
to group together a set of directories or files into a
single entity (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC137">The modules file</A>).  A typical usage is to
define one module per project.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC8">Revision numbers</A></H2>

<A NAME="IDX29"></A>
<A NAME="IDX30"></A>
<A NAME="IDX31"></A>

</P>
<P>
Each version of a file has a unique <EM>revision
number</EM>.  Revision numbers look like <SAMP>`1.1'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`1.2'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`1.3.2.2'</SAMP> or even <SAMP>`1.3.2.2.4.5'</SAMP>.
A revision number always has an even number of
period-separated decimal integers.  By default revision
1.1 is the first revision of a file.  Each successive
revision is given a new number by increasing the
rightmost number by one.  The following figure displays
a few revisions, with newer revisions to the right.

</P>

<PRE>
       +-----+    +-----+    +-----+    +-----+    +-----+
       ! 1.1 !----! 1.2 !----! 1.3 !----! 1.4 !----! 1.5 !
       +-----+    +-----+    +-----+    +-----+    +-----+
</PRE>

<P>
CVS is not limited to linear development.  The
<EM>revision tree</EM> can be split into <EM>branches</EM>,
where each branch is a self-maintained line of
development.  Changes made on one branch can easily be
moved back to the main trunk.  

</P>
<P>
Each branch has a <EM>branch number</EM>, consisting of an
odd number of period-separated decimal integers.  The
branch number is created by appending an integer to the
revision number where the corresponding branch forked
off.  Having branch numbers allows more than one branch
to be forked off from a certain revision.

</P>
<P>
All revisions on a branch have revision numbers formed
by appending an ordinal number to the branch number.
The following figure illustrates branching with an
example.

</P>

</PRE>

<P>
The exact details of how the branch number is
constructed is not something you normally need to be
concerned about, but here is how it works: When
CVS creates a branch number it picks the first
unused even integer, starting with 2.  So when you want
to create a branch from revision 6.4 it will be
numbered 6.4.2.  All branch numbers ending in a zero
(such as 6.4.0) are used internally by CVS
(see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC153">Magic branch numbers</A>).  The branch 1.1.1 has a
special meaning.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC63">Tracking third-party sources</A>.

A file can have several versions, as described above.
Likewise, a software product can have several versions.
A software product is often given a version number such

</P>
<P>
Versions in the first sense are called <EM>revisions</EM>
in this document, and versions in the second sense are
called <EM>releases</EM>.  To avoid confusion, the word
<EM>version</EM> is almost never used in this document.

This section describes a typical work-session using
CVS.  It assumes that a repository is set up
(see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC15">The Repository</A>).

</P>
<P>
Suppose you are working on a simple compiler.  The source
consists of a handful of C files and a <TT>`Makefile'</TT>.
The compiler is called <SAMP>`tc'</SAMP> (Trivial Compiler),
and the repository is set up so that there is a module
called <SAMP>`tc'</SAMP>.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC11">Getting the source</A></H2>

<A NAME="IDX41"></A>
<A NAME="IDX42"></A>
<A NAME="IDX43"></A>
<A NAME="IDX44"></A>
<A NAME="IDX45"></A>

</P>
<P>
The first thing you must do is to get your own working copy of the
source for <SAMP>`tc'</SAMP>.  For this, you use the <CODE>checkout</CODE> command:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs checkout tc
</PRE>

<P>
This will create a new directory called <TT>`tc'</TT> and populate it with
the source files.

</P>

<PRE>
$ cd tc
$ ls
CVS         Makefile    backend.c   driver.c    frontend.c  parser.c
</PRE>

<P>
The <TT>`CVS'</TT> directory is used internally by
CVS.  Normally, you should not modify or remove
any of the files in it.

</P>
<P>
You start your favorite editor, hack away at <TT>`backend.c'</TT>, and a couple
of hours later you have added an optimization pass to the compiler.
A note to RCS and SCCS users: There is no need to lock the files that
you want to edit.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC37">Multiple developers</A> for an explanation.

<P>
When you have checked that the compiler is still compilable you decide
to make a new version of <TT>`backend.c'</TT>.

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs commit backend.c
</PRE>

<P>
CVS starts an editor, to allow you to enter a log
message.  You type in "Added an optimization pass.",
save the temporary file, and exit the editor.

</P>
<P>
The environment variable <CODE>$CVSEDITOR</CODE> determines
which editor is started.  If <CODE>$CVSEDITOR</CODE> is not
set, then if the environment variable <CODE>$EDITOR</CODE> is
set, it will be used. If both <CODE>$CVSEDITOR</CODE> and
<CODE>$EDITOR</CODE> are not set then the editor defaults to
<CODE>vi</CODE>.  If you want to avoid the overhead of
starting an editor you can specify the log message on
the command line using the <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> flag instead, like
this:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs commit -m "Added an optimization pass" backend.c

</P>
<P>
Before you turn to other tasks you decide to remove your working copy of
tc.  One acceptable way to do that is of course

</P>

<PRE>
$ cd ..
$ rm -r tc
</PRE>

<P>
but a better way is to use the <CODE>release</CODE> command (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC122">release--Indicate that a Module is no longer in use</A>):

</P>

<PRE>
$ cd ..
$ cvs release -d tc
M driver.c
? tc
You have [1] altered files in this repository.
Are you sure you want to release (and delete) module `tc': n
** `release' aborted by user choice.
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>release</CODE> command checks that all your modifications have been

When you use the <SAMP>`-d'</SAMP> flag with <CODE>release</CODE>, it

In the example above, the <CODE>release</CODE> command wrote a couple of lines
of output.  <SAMP>`? tc'</SAMP> means that the file <TT>`tc'</TT> is unknown to CVS.
That is nothing to worry about: <TT>`tc'</TT> is the executable compiler,

The CVS <EM>repository</EM> stores a complete copy of
all the files and directories which are under version
control.

</P>
<P>
Normally, you never access any of the files in the
repository directly.  Instead, you use CVS
commands to get your own copy of the files, and then
work on that copy.  When you've finished a set of
changes, you check (or <EM>commit</EM>) them back into the
repository.  The repository then contains the changes
which you have made, as well as recording exactly what
you changed, when you changed it, and other such
information.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX62"></A>
CVS can access a repository by a variety of
means.  It might be on the local computer, or it might
be on a computer across the room or across the world.
To distinguish various ways to access a repository, the
repository name can start with an <EM>access method</EM>.
For example, the access method <CODE>:local:</CODE> means to
access a repository directory, so the repository
<CODE>:local:/usr/local/cvsroot</CODE> means that the
repository is in <TT>`/usr/local/cvsroot'</TT> on the
computer running CVS.  For information on other
access methods, see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC24">Remote repositories</A>.

</P>
<P>
If the access method is omitted, then if the repository
does not contain <SAMP>`:'</SAMP>, then <CODE>:local:</CODE> is
assumed.  If it does contain <SAMP>`:'</SAMP> than either
<CODE>:ext:</CODE> or <CODE>:server:</CODE> is assumed.  For
example, if you have a local repository in
<TT>`/usr/local/cvsroot'</TT>, you can use
<CODE>/usr/local/cvsroot</CODE> instead of
<CODE>:local:/usr/local/cvsroot</CODE>.  But if (under
Windows NT, for example) your local repository is
<TT>`c:\src\cvsroot'</TT>, then you must specify the access
method, as in <CODE>:local:c:\src\cvsroot</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The repository is split in two parts.  <TT>`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT'</TT> contains
administrative files for CVS.  The other directories contain the actual
user-defined modules.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC16">Telling CVS where your repository is</A></H2>

<P>
There are a couple of different ways to tell CVS
where to find the repository.  You can name the
repository on the command line explicitly, with the
<CODE>-d</CODE> (for "directory") option:

</P>

<PRE>
cvs -d /usr/local/cvsroot checkout yoyodyne/tc
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX63"></A>
<A NAME="IDX64"></A>
<A NAME="IDX65"></A>
<A NAME="IDX66"></A>
<A NAME="IDX67"></A>
        Or you can set the <CODE>$CVSROOT</CODE> environment
variable to an absolute path to the root of the
repository, <TT>`/usr/local/cvsroot'</TT> in this example.
To set <CODE>$CVSROOT</CODE>, all <CODE>csh</CODE> and <CODE>tcsh</CODE>
users should have this line in their <TT>`.cshrc'</TT> or
<TT>`.tcshrc'</TT> files:

</P>

<PRE>
setenv CVSROOT /usr/local/cvsroot
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>sh</CODE> and <CODE>bash</CODE> users should instead have these lines in their
<TT>`.profile'</TT> or <TT>`.bashrc'</TT>:

</P>

<PRE>
CVSROOT=/usr/local/cvsroot
export CVSROOT
</PRE>

<P>
        A repository specified with <CODE>-d</CODE> will
override the <CODE>$CVSROOT</CODE> environment variable.
Once you've checked a working copy out from the
repository, it will remember where its repository is
(the information is recorded in the
<TT>`CVS/Root'</TT> file in the working copy).  

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>-d</CODE> option and the <TT>`CVS/Root'</TT> file both
override the <CODE>$CVSROOT</CODE> environment variable.  If
<CODE>-d</CODE> option differs from <TT>`CVS/Root'</TT>, the
former is used (and specifying <CODE>-d</CODE> will cause
<TT>`CVS/Root'</TT> to be updated).  Of course, for proper
operation they should be two ways of referring to the
same repository.

</P>
<P>
For most purposes it isn't important <EM>how</EM>
CVS stores information in the repository.  In
fact, the format has changed in the past, and is likely
to change in the future.  Since in almost all cases one
accesses the repository via CVS commands; such
changes need not be disruptive.

</P>
<P>
However, in some cases it may be necessary to
understand how CVS stores data in the repository,
for example you might need to track down CVS locks
(see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC42">Several developers simultaneously attempting to run CVS</A>) or you might need to deal with
the file permissions appropriate for the repository.

The overall structure of the repository is a directory

The history files contain, among other things, enough
information to recreate any revision of the file, a log
of all commit messages and the user-name of the person
who committed the revision.  The history files are
known as <EM>RCS files</EM>, because the first program to
store files in that format was a version control system
known as RCS.  For a full
description of the file format, see the <CODE>man</CODE> page
<CITE>rcsfile(5)</CITE>, distributed with RCS.  This
file format has become very common--many systems other
than CVS or RCS can at least import history
files in this format.

<A NAME="IDX71"></A>
<A NAME="IDX72"></A>
<A NAME="IDX73"></A>
<A NAME="IDX74"></A>
All <SAMP>`,v'</SAMP> files are created read-only, and you
should not change the permission of those files.  The
directories inside the repository should be writable by
the persons that have permission to modify the files in
each directory.  This normally means that you must
create a UNIX group (see group(5)) consisting of the
persons that are to edit the files in a project, and
set up the repository so that it is that group that
owns the directory.

</P>
<P>
This means that you can only control access to files on
a per-directory basis.

</P>
<P>
Note that users must also have write access to check
out files, because CVS needs to create lock files
(see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC42">Several developers simultaneously attempting to run CVS</A>).

</P>
<P>
Also note that users must have write access to the
<TT>`CVSROOT/val-tags'</TT> file.  CVS uses it to keep
track of what tags are valid tag names (it is sometimes
updated when tags are used, as well as when they are
created, though).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX75"></A>

CVS tries to set up reasonable file permissions
for new directories that are added inside the tree, but
you must fix the permissions manually when a new
directory should have different permissions than its
parent directory.  If you set the <CODE>CVSUMASK</CODE>
environment variable that will control the file
permissions which CVS uses in creating directories
and/or files in the repository.  <CODE>CVSUMASK</CODE> does
not affect the file permissions in the working
directory; such files have the permissions which are
typical for newly created files, except that sometimes
CVS creates them read-only (see the sections on
watches, section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC44">Telling CVS to watch certain files</A>; -r, section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC89">Global options</A>; or CVSREAD, section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC151">All environment variables which affect CVS</A>).

The directory <TT>`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT'</TT> contains some <EM>administrative

You can use CVS without any of these files, but
some commands work better when at least the
<TT>`modules'</TT> file is properly set up.

</P>

The most important of these files is the <TT>`modules'</TT>

In some situations it is a good idea to have more than
one repository, for instance if you have two
development groups that work on separate projects
without sharing any code.  All you have to do to have
several repositories is to specify the appropriate
repository, using the <CODE>CVSROOT</CODE> environment
variable, the <SAMP>`-d'</SAMP> option to CVS, or (once
you have checked out a working directory) by simply
allowing CVS to use the repository that was used
to check out the working directory
(see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC16">Telling CVS where your repository is</A>).

</P>
<P>
The big advantage of having multiple repositories is
that they can reside on different servers.  The big
disadvantage is that you cannot have a single CVS
command recurse into directories which comes from
different repositories.  Generally speaking, if you are
thinking of setting up several repositories on the same
machine, you might want to consider using several
directories within the same repository.

To set up a CVS repository, choose a directory
with ample disk space available for the revision
history of the source files.  It should be accessable
(directly or via a networked file system) from all
machines which want to use CVS in server or local
mode; the client machines need not have any access to
it other than via the CVS protocol.  It is not
possible to use CVS to read from a repository
which one only has read access to; CVS needs to be
able to create lock files (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC42">Several developers simultaneously attempting to run CVS</A>).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX94"></A>
To create a repository, run the <CODE>cvs init</CODE>
command.  It will set up an empty repository in the
CVS root specified in the usual way
(see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC15">The Repository</A>).  For example,

</P>

<PRE>
cvs -d /usr/local/cvsroot init
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>cvs init</CODE> is careful to never overwrite any
existing files in the repository, so no harm is done if
you run <CODE>cvs init</CODE> on an already set-up
repository.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>cvs init</CODE> will enable history logging; if you
don't want that, remove the history file after running
<CODE>cvs init</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC149">The history file</A>.

</P>
<P>
        Your working copy of the sources can be on a
different machine than the repository.  Generally,
using a remote repository is just like using a local
one, except that the format of the repository name is:

</P>

<PRE>
:<VAR>method</VAR>:<VAR>user</VAR>@<VAR>hostname</VAR>:/path/to/repository
</PRE>

<P>
The details of exactly what needs to be set up depend
on how you are connecting to the server.

</P>
<P>
If <VAR>method</VAR> is not specified, and the repository
name contains <SAMP>`:'</SAMP>, then the default is <CODE>ext</CODE>
or <CODE>server</CODE>, depending on your platform; both are
described in section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC25">Connecting with rsh</A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC25" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC25">Connecting with rsh</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX98"></A>
CVS uses the <TT>`rsh'</TT> protocol to perform these
operations, so the remote user host needs to have a
<TT>`.rhosts'</TT> file which grants access to the local
user.

</P>
<P>
For example, suppose you are the user <TT>`mozart'</TT> on
the local machine <TT>`anklet.grunge.com'</TT>, and the
server machine is <TT>`chainsaw.brickyard.com'</TT>.  On
chainsaw, put the following line into the file
<TT>`.rhosts'</TT> in <TT>`bach'</TT>'s home directory:

</P>

<PRE>
anklet.grunge.com  mozart
</PRE>

<P>
Then test that <CODE>rsh</CODE> is working with

</P>

<PRE>
rsh -l bach chainsaw.brickyard.com 'echo $PATH'
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX99"></A>
Next you have to make sure that <CODE>rsh</CODE> will be able
to find the server.  Make sure that the path which
<CODE>rsh</CODE> printed in the above example includes the
directory containing a program named <CODE>cvs</CODE> which
is the server.  You need to set the path in
<TT>`.bashrc'</TT>, <TT>`.cshrc'</TT>, etc., not <TT>`.login'</TT>
or <TT>`.profile'</TT>.  Alternately, you can set the
environment variable <CODE>CVS_SERVER</CODE> on the client
machine to the filename of the server you want to use,
for example <TT>`/usr/local/bin/cvs-1.6'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
There is no need to edit <CODE>inetd.conf</CODE> or start a
CVS server daemon.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX100"></A>
<A NAME="IDX101"></A>
There are two access methods that you use in CVSROOT
for rsh.  <CODE>:server:</CODE> specifies an internal rsh
client, which is supported only by some CVS ports.
<CODE>:ext:</CODE> specifies an external rsh program.  By
default this is <CODE>rsh</CODE> but you may set the
<CODE>CVS_RSH</CODE> environment variable to invoke another
program which can access the remote server (for
example, <CODE>remsh</CODE> on HP-UX 9 because <CODE>rsh</CODE> is
something different).  It must be a program which can
transmit data to and from the server without modifying
it; for example the Windows NT <CODE>rsh</CODE> is not
suitable since it by default translates between CRLF
and LF.  The OS/2 CVS port has a hack to pass <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP>
to <CODE>rsh</CODE> to get around this, but since this could
potentially cause programs for programs other than the
standard <CODE>rsh</CODE>, it may change in the future.  If
you set <CODE>CVS_RSH</CODE> to <CODE>SSH</CODE> or some other rsh
replacement, the instructions in the rest of this
section concerning <TT>`.rhosts'</TT> and so on are likely
to be incorrect; consult the documentation for your rsh
replacement.

</P>
<P>
Continuing our example, supposing you want to access
the module <TT>`foo'</TT> in the repository
<TT>`/usr/local/cvsroot/'</TT>, on machine
<TT>`chainsaw.brickyard.com'</TT>, you are ready to go:

</P>

<PRE>
cvs -d :ext:bach@chainsaw.brickyard.com:/usr/local/cvsroot checkout foo

Because the client stores and transmits passwords in
cleartext (almost--see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC29">Security considerations with password authentication</A> for details), a separate CVS password
file may be used, so people don't compromise their
regular passwords when they access the repository.
This file is <TT>`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/passwd'</TT>
(see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC20">The administrative files</A>).  Its format is
similar to <TT>`/etc/passwd'</TT>, except that it only has
two fields, username and password.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
bach:ULtgRLXo7NRxs
cwang:1sOp854gDF3DY
</PRE>

<P>
The password is encrypted according to the standard
Unix <CODE>crypt()</CODE> function, so it is possible to
paste in passwords directly from regular Unix
<TT>`passwd'</TT> files.

</P>
<P>
When authenticating a password, the server first checks
for the user in the CVS <TT>`passwd'</TT> file.  If it
finds the user, it compares against that password.  If
it does not find the user, or if the CVS
<TT>`passwd'</TT> file does not exist, then the server
tries to match the password using the system's
user-lookup routine.  When using the CVS
<TT>`passwd'</TT> file, the server runs under as the
username specified in the the third argument in the
entry, or as the first argument if there is no third
argument (in this way CVS allows imaginary
usernames provided the CVS <TT>`passwd'</TT> file
indicates corresponding valid system usernames).  In
any case, CVS will have no privileges which the
(valid) user would not have.

</P>
<P>
Right now, the only way to put a password in the
CVS <TT>`passwd'</TT> file is to paste it there from
somewhere else.  Someday, there may be a <CODE>cvs
passwd</CODE> command.

</P>

Before connecting to the server, the client must <EM>log
in</EM> with the command <CODE>cvs login</CODE>.  Logging in
verifies a password with the server, and also records
the password for later transactions with the server.
The <CODE>cvs login</CODE> command needs to know the
username, server hostname, and full repository path,
and it gets this information from the repository
argument or the <CODE>CVSROOT</CODE> environment variable.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>cvs login</CODE> is interactive -- it prompts for a
password:

</P>

<PRE>
cvs -d :pserver:bach@chainsaw.brickyard.com:/usr/local/cvsroot login 
CVS password: 
</PRE>

<P>
The password is checked with the server; if it is
correct, the <CODE>login</CODE> succeeds, else it fails,
complaining that the password was incorrect.

</P>
<P>
Once you have logged in, you can force CVS to
connect directly to the server and authenticate with
the stored password:

</P>

<PRE>
cvs -d :pserver:bach@chainsaw.brickyard.com:/usr/local/cvsroot checkout foo
</PRE>

<P>
The <SAMP>`:pserver:'</SAMP> is necessary because without it,
CVS will assume it should use <CODE>rsh</CODE> to
connect with the server (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC25">Connecting with rsh</A>).
(Once you have a working copy checked out and are
running CVS commands from within it, there is no
longer any need to specify the repository explicitly,
because CVS records it in the working copy's
<TT>`CVS'</TT> subdirectory.)

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX111"></A>
Passwords are stored by default in the file
<TT>`$HOME/.cvspass'</TT>.  Its format is human-readable,
but don't edit it unless you know what you are doing.
The passwords are not stored in cleartext, but are
trivially encoded to protect them from "innocent"
compromise (i.e., inadvertently being seen by a system
administrator who happens to look at that file).

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>CVS_PASSFILE</CODE> environment variable overrides
this default.  If you use this variable, make sure you
set it <EM>before</EM> <CODE>cvs login</CODE> is run.  If you
were to set it after running <CODE>cvs login</CODE>, then
later CVS commands would be unable to look up the
password for transmission to the server.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX112"></A>
The <CODE>CVS_PASSWORD</CODE> environment variable overrides
<EM>all</EM> stored passwords.  If it is set, CVS
will use it for all password-authenticated
connections.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC29" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC29">Security considerations with password authentication</A></H4>

<P>
The passwords are stored on the client side in a
trivial encoding of the cleartext, and transmitted in
the same encoding.  The encoding is done only to
prevent inadvertent password compromises (i.e., a
system administrator accidentally looking at the file),
and will not prevent even a naive attacker from gaining
the password.

</P>
<P>
The separate CVS password file (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC27">Setting up the server for password authentication</A>) allows people
to use a different password for repository access than
for login access.  On the other hand, once a user has
access to the repository, she can execute programs on
the server system through a variety of means.  Thus, repository
access implies fairly broad system access as well.  It
might be possible to modify CVS to prevent that,
but no one has done so as of this writing.
Furthermore, there may be other ways in which having
access to CVS allows people to gain more general
access to the system; noone has done a careful audit.

</P>
<P>
In summary, anyone who gets the password gets
repository access, and some measure of general system
access as well.  The password is available to anyone
who can sniff network packets or read a protected
(i.e., user read-only) file.  If you want real
security, get Kerberos.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC30" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC30">Direct connection with kerberos</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX113"></A>
<A NAME="IDX114"></A>
The main disadvantage of using rsh is that all the data
needs to pass through additional programs, so it may be
slower.  So if you have kerberos installed you can
connect via a direct TCP connection,
authenticating with kerberos.

</P>
<P>
To do this, CVS needs to be compiled with kerberos
support; when configuring CVS it tries to detect
whether kerberos is present or you can use the
<TT>`--with-krb4'</TT> flag to configure.

</P>
<P>
The data transmitted is <EM>not</EM> encrypted by
default.  Encryption support must be compiled into both
the client and server; use the
<TT>`--enable-encryption'</TT> configure option to turn it
on.  You must then use the <CODE>-x</CODE> global option to
request encryption.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX115"></A>
You need to edit <CODE>inetd.conf</CODE> on the server
machine to run <CODE>cvs kserver</CODE>.  The client uses
port 1999 by default; if you want to use another port
specify it in the <CODE>CVS_CLIENT_PORT</CODE> environment
variable on the client.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX116"></A>
When you want to use CVS, get a ticket in the
usual way (generally <CODE>kinit</CODE>); it must be a ticket
which allows you to log into the server machine.  Then
you are ready to go:

</P>

<PRE>
cvs -d :kserver:chainsaw.brickyard.com:/user/local/cvsroot checkout foo
</PRE>

<P>
Previous versions of CVS would fall back to a
connection via rsh; this version will not do so.

<P>
Because renaming files and moving them between
directories is somewhat inconvenient, the first thing
you do when you start a new project should be to think
through your file organization.  It is not impossible
to rename or move files, but it does increase the
potential for confusion and CVS does have some
quirks particularly in the area of renaming
directories.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC67">Moving and renaming files</A>.

What to do next depends on the situation at hand.

<H3><A NAME="SEC33" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC33">Creating a directory tree from a number of files</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX119"></A>

</P>
<P>
When you begin using CVS, you will probably already have several
projects that can be
put under CVS control.  In these cases the easiest way is to use the
<CODE>import</CODE> command.  An example is probably the easiest way to
explain how to use it.  If the files you want to install in
CVS reside in <TT>`<VAR>wdir</VAR>'</TT>, and you want them to appear in the
repository as <TT>`$CVSROOT/yoyodyne/<VAR>rdir</VAR>'</TT>, you can do this:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cd <VAR>wdir</VAR>
$ cvs import -m "Imported sources" yoyodyne/<VAR>rdir</VAR> yoyo start
</PRE>

<P>
Unless you supply a log message with the <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP>
flag, CVS starts an editor and prompts for a
message.  The string <SAMP>`yoyo'</SAMP> is a <EM>vendor tag</EM>,
and <SAMP>`start'</SAMP> is a <EM>release tag</EM>.  They may fill
no purpose in this context, but since CVS requires
them they must be present.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC63">Tracking third-party sources</A>, for
more information about them.

</P>
<P>
You can now verify that it worked, and remove your
original source directory.

</P>

<PRE>
$ cd ..
$ mv <VAR>dir</VAR> <VAR>dir</VAR>.orig
$ cvs checkout yoyodyne/<VAR>dir</VAR>       # Explanation below
$ ls -R yoyodyne
$ rm -r <VAR>dir</VAR>.orig
</PRE>

<P>
Erasing the original sources is a good idea, to make sure that you do
not accidentally edit them in <VAR>dir</VAR>, bypassing CVS.
Of course, it would be wise to make sure that you have
a backup of the sources before you remove them.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>checkout</CODE> command can either take a module
name as argument (as it has done in all previous
examples) or a path name relative to <CODE>$CVSROOT</CODE>,
as it did in the example above.

</P>
<P>
It is a good idea to check that the permissions
CVS sets on the directories inside <SAMP>`$CVSROOT'</SAMP>
are reasonable, and that they belong to the proper
groups.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC19">File permissions</A>.

</P>
<P>
If some of the files you want to import are binary, you
may want to use the wrappers features to specify which
files are binary and which are not.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC138">The cvswrappers file</A>.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT>From RCS
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX121"></A>
 
If you have been using RCS, find the RCS
files--usually a file named <TT>`foo.c'</TT> will have its
RCS file in <TT>`RCS/foo.c,v'</TT> (but it could be
other places; consult the RCS documentation for
details).  Then create the appropriate directories in
CVS if they do not already exist.  Then copy the
files into the appropriate directories in the CVS
repository (the name in the repository must be the name
of the source file with <SAMP>`,v'</SAMP> added; the files go
directly in the appopriate directory of the repository,
not in an <TT>`RCS'</TT> subdirectory).  This is one of the
few times when it is a good idea to access the CVS
repository directly, rather than using CVS
commands.  Then you are ready to check out a new
working directory.

The RCS file should not be locked when you move it
into CVS; if it is, CVS will have trouble
letting you operate on it.

<DT>From another version control system
<DD>
Many version control systems have the ability to export
RCS files in the standard format.  If yours does,
export the RCS files and then follow the above
instructions.

<A NAME="IDX122"></A>
<DT>From SCCS
<DD>
There is a script in the <TT>`contrib'</TT> directory of
the CVS source distribution called <TT>`sccs2rcs'</TT>
which converts SCCS files to RCS files.
Note: you must run it on a machine which has both
SCCS and RCS installed, and like everything
else in contrib it is unsupported (your mileage may
vary).

When more than one person works on a software project
things often get complicated.  Often, two people try to
edit the same file simultaneously.  One solution, known
as <EM>file locking</EM> or <EM>reserved checkouts</EM>, is
to allow only one person to edit each file at a time.
This is the only solution with some version control
systems, including RCS and SCCS.  CVS
doesn't have a very nice implementation of reserved
checkouts (yet) but there are ways to get it working
(for example, see the <CODE>cvs admin -l</CODE> command in
section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC92">admin options</A>).  It also may be possible to use
the watches features described below, together with
suitable procedures (not enforced by software), to
avoid having two people edit at the same time.

</P>
<P>
The default model with CVS is known as
<EM>unreserved checkouts</EM>.  In this model, developers
can edit their own <EM>working copy</EM> of a file
simultaneously.  The first person that commits his
changes has no automatic way of knowing that another
has started to edit it.  Others will get an error
message when they try to commit the file.  They must
then use CVS commands to bring their working copy
up to date with the repository revision.  This process
is almost automatic.

</P>
<P>
CVS also supports mechanisms which facilitate
various kinds of communcation, without actually
enforcing rules like reserved checkouts do.

</P>
<P>
The rest of this chapter describes how these various
models work, and some of the issues involved in
choosing between them.

Based on what operations you have performed on a

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT>Up-to-date
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX137"></A>
 
The file is identical with the latest revision in the
repository for the branch in use.

<DT>Locally Modified
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX138"></A>
You have edited the file, and not yet committed your changes.

<DT>Locally Added
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX139"></A>
You have added the file with <CODE>add</CODE>, and not yet
committed your changes.

<DT>Locally Removed

<A NAME="IDX140"></A>
You have removed the file with <CODE>remove</CODE>, and not yet
committed your changes.

<DT>Needs Checkout
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX141"></A>
Someone else has committed a newer revision to the
repository.  The name is slightly misleading; you will
ordinarily use <CODE>update</CODE> rather than
<CODE>checkout</CODE> to get that newer revision.

<DT>Needs Patch
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX142"></A>
Like Needs Checkout, but the CVS server will send
a patch rather than the entire file.  Sending a patch or
sending an entire file accomplishes the same thing.

<DT>Needs Merge
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX143"></A>
Someone else has committed a newer revision to the repository, and you
have also made modifications to the file.

<DT>Unresolved Conflict
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX144"></A>
This is like Locally Modified, except that a previous
<CODE>update</CODE> command gave a conflict.  You need to
resolve the conflict as described in section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC40">Conflicts example</A>.

<DT>Unknown

<A NAME="IDX145"></A>
CVS doesn't know anything about this file.  For

<P>
To help clarify the file status, <CODE>status</CODE> also
reports the <CODE>Working revision</CODE> which is the

When you want to update or merge a file, use the <CODE>update</CODE>
command.  For files that are not up to date this is roughly equivalent
to a <CODE>checkout</CODE> command: the newest revision of the file is
extracted from the repository and put in your working copy of the
module.

</P>
<P>
Your modifications to a file are never lost when you
use <CODE>update</CODE>.  If no newer revision exists,
running <CODE>update</CODE> has no effect.  If you have
edited the file, and a newer revision is available,
CVS will merge all changes into your working copy.

</P>
<P>
For instance, imagine that you checked out revision 1.4 and started
editing it.  In the meantime someone else committed revision 1.5, and
shortly after that revision 1.6.  If you run <CODE>update</CODE> on the file
now, CVS will incorporate all changes between revision 1.4 and 1.6 into
your file.

You resolve the conflict by editing the file, removing the markers and
the erroneous line.  Suppose you end up with this file:

<PRE>
#include &#60;stdlib.h&#62;
#include &#60;stdio.h&#62;

int main(int argc,
         char **argv)
{
    init_scanner();
    parse();
    if (argc != 1)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "tc: No args expected.\n");
        exit(1);
    }
    if (nerr == 0)
        gencode();
    else
        fprintf(stderr, "No code generated.\n");
    exit(nerr == 0 ? EXIT_SUCCESS : EXIT_FAILURE);
}
</PRE>

<P>
You can now go ahead and commit this as revision 1.7.

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs commit -m "Initialize scanner. Use symbolic exit values." driver.c

</PRE>

<P>
For your protection, CVS will refuse to check in a
file if a conflict occurred and you have not resolved
the conflict.  Currently to resolve a conflict, you
must change the timestamp on the file, and must also
insure that the file contains no conflict markers.  If
your file legitimately contains conflict markers (that
is, occurrences of <SAMP>`&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; '</SAMP> at the start of a
line that don't mark a conflict), then CVS has
trouble handling this and you need to start hacking on
the <CODE>CVS/Entries</CODE> file or other such workarounds.

If you use release 1.04 or later of pcl-cvs (a GNU
Emacs front-end for CVS) you can use an Emacs
package called emerge to help you resolve conflicts.

CVS will try again every 30 seconds, and either

For many groups, use of CVS in its default mode is
perfectly satisfactory.  Users may sometimes go to
check in a modification only to find that another
modification has intervened, but they deal with it and
proceed with their check in.  Other groups prefer to be
able to know who is editing what files, so that if two
people try to edit the same file they can choose to
talk about who is doing what when rather than be
surprised at check in time.  The features in this
section allow such coordination, while retaining the
ability of two developers to edit the same file at the
same time.

</P>
<P>
For maximum benefit developers should use <CODE>cvs
edit</CODE> (not <CODE>chmod</CODE>) to make files read-write to
edit them, and <CODE>cvs release</CODE> (not <CODE>rm</CODE>) to
discard a working directory which is no longer in use,
but CVS is not able to enforce this behavior.

When the conditions exist for notification, CVS
calls the <TT>`notify'</TT> administrative file.  Edit
<TT>`notify'</TT> as one edits the other administrative
files (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC20">The administrative files</A>).  This
file follows the usual conventions for administrative
files (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC140">The common syntax</A>), where each line is a regular
expression followed by a command to execute.  The
command should contain a single ocurrence of <SAMP>`%s'</SAMP>
which will be replaced by the user to notify; the rest
of the information regarding the notification will be
supplied to the command on standard input.  The
standard thing to put in the <CODE>notify</CODE> file is the
single line:

</P>

<PRE>
ALL mail %s -s \"CVS notification\"
</PRE>

<P>
This causes users to be notified by electronic mail.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX180"></A>
Note that if you set this up in the straightforward
way, users receive notifications on the server machine.
One could of course write a <TT>`notify'</TT> script which
directed notifications elsewhere, but to make this
easy, CVS allows you to associate a notification
address for each user.  To do so create a file
<TT>`users'</TT> in <TT>`CVSROOT'</TT> with a line for each
user in the format <VAR>user</VAR>:<VAR>value</VAR>.  Then
instead of passing the name of the user to be notified
to <TT>`notify'</TT>, CVS will pass the <VAR>value</VAR>
(normally an email address on some other machine).

<H3><A NAME="SEC46" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC46">How to edit a file which is being watched</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX181"></A>
Since a file which is being watched is checked out
read-only, you cannot simply edit it.  To make it
read-write, and inform others that you are planning to
edit it, use the <CODE>cvs edit</CODE> command.  Some systems
call this a <EM>checkout</EM>, but CVS uses that term
for obtaining a copy of the sources (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC11">Getting the source</A>), an operation which those systems call a
<EM>get</EM> or a <EM>fetch</EM>.

<P>
Prepare to edit the working files <VAR>files</VAR>.  CVS makes the
<VAR>files</VAR> read-write, and notifies users who have requested
<CODE>edit</CODE> notification for any of <VAR>files</VAR>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>cvs edit</CODE> command accepts the same <VAR>options</VAR> as the
<CODE>cvs watch add</CODE> command, and establishes a temporary watch for the
user on <VAR>files</VAR>; CVS will remove the watch when <VAR>files</VAR> are
<CODE>unedit</CODE>ed or <CODE>commit</CODE>ted.  If the user does not wish to
receive notifications, she should specify <CODE>-a none</CODE>.

</P>
<P>

</P>
</DL>

<P>
Normally when you are done with a set of changes, you
use the <CODE>cvs commit</CODE> command, which checks in your
changes and returns the watched files to their usual
read-only state.  But if you instead decide to abandon
your changes, or not to make any changes, you can use
the <CODE>cvs unedit</CODE> command.

Abandon work on the working files <VAR>files</VAR>, and revert them to the
repository versions on which they are based.  CVS makes those
<VAR>files</VAR> read-only for which users have requested notification using
<CODE>cvs watch on</CODE>.  CVS notifies users who have requested <CODE>unedit</CODE>
notification for any of <VAR>files</VAR>.

</P>
<P>
The <VAR>files</VAR> and <CODE>-l</CODE> option are processed as for the
<CODE>cvs watch</CODE> commands.

</P>
<P>
If watches are not in use, the <CODE>unedit</CODE> command
probably does not work, and the way to revert to the
repository version is to remove the file and then use
<CODE>cvs update</CODE> to get a new copy.  The meaning is
not precisely the same; removing and updating may also
bring in some changes which have been made in the
repository since the last time you updated.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
When using client/server CVS, you can use the

successful CVS command.

</P>

and your operation will likely be aborted.  To use the
watch features, you must upgrade all copies of CVS
which use that repository in local or server mode.  If
you cannot upgrade, use the <CODE>watch off</CODE> and
<CODE>watch remove</CODE> commands to remove all watches, and
that will restore the repository to a state which
CVS 1.6 can cope with.

<H2><A NAME="SEC49" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC49">Choosing between reserved or unreserved checkouts</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX193"></A>

</P>
<P>
Reserved and unreserved checkouts each have pros and
cons.  Let it be said that a lot of this is a matter of
opinion or what works given different groups' working
styles, but here is an attempt to briefly describe the
issues.  There are many ways to organize a team of
developers.  CVS does not try to enforce a certain
organization.  It is a tool that can be used in several
ways.

</P>
<P>
Reserved checkouts can be very counter-productive.  If
two persons want to edit different parts of a file,
there may be no reason to prevent either of them from
doing so.  Also, it is common for someone to take out a
lock on a file, because they are planning to edit it,
but then forget to release the lock.

</P>
<P>
People, especially people who are familiar with
reserved checkouts, often wonder how often conflicts
occur if unreserved checkouts are used, and how
difficult they are to resolve.  The experience with
many groups is that they occur rarely and usually are
relatively straightforward to resolve.

</P>
<P>
The rarity of serious conflicts may be surprising, until one realizes
that they occur only when two developers disagree on the proper design
for a given section of code; such a disagreement suggests that the
team has not been communicating properly in the first place.  In order
to collaborate under <EM>any</EM> source management regimen, developers
must agree on the general design of the system; given this agreement,
overlapping changes are usually straightforward to merge.

</P>
<P>
In some cases unreserved checkouts are clearly
inappropriate.  If no merge tool exists for the kind of
file you are managing (for example word processor files
or files edited by Computer Aided Design programs), and
it is not desirable to change to a program which uses a
mergeable data format, then resolving conflicts is
going to be unpleasant enough that you generally will
be better off to simply avoid the conflicts instead, by
using reserved checkouts.

</P>
<P>
The watches features described above in section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC43">Mechanisms to track who is editing files</A>
can be considered to be an intermediate model between
reserved checkouts and unreserved checkouts.  When you
go to edit a file, it is possible to find out who else
is editing it.  And rather than having the system
simply forbid both people editing the file, it can tell
you what the situation is and let you figure out
whether it is a problem in that particular case or not.
Therefore, for some groups it can be considered the
best of both the reserved checkout and unreserved
checkout worlds.

You can use the <CODE>tag</CODE> command to give a symbolic name to a

<CODE>status</CODE> command to see all tags that a file has, and
which revision numbers they represent.  Tag names can
contain uppercase and lowercase letters, digits,
<SAMP>`-'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`_'</SAMP>.  The two tag names <CODE>BASE</CODE>
and <CODE>HEAD</CODE> are reserved for use by CVS.  It
is expected that future names which are special to
CVS will contain characters such as <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`='</SAMP>, rather than being named analogously to
<CODE>BASE</CODE> and <CODE>HEAD</CODE>, to avoid conflicts with
actual tag names.

<P>
There is seldom reason to tag a file in isolation.  A more common use is
to tag all the files that constitute a module with the same tag at
strategic points in the development life-cycle, such as when a release
is made.

The <CODE>checkout</CODE> command has a flag, <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP>, that lets you check out
a certain revision of a module.  This flag makes it easy to
retrieve the sources that make up release 1.0 of the module <SAMP>`tc'</SAMP> at
any time in the future:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs checkout -r release-1-0 tc

<P>
This is useful, for instance, if someone claims that there is a bug in
that release, but you cannot find the bug in the current working copy.

<P>
You can also check out a module as it was at any given date.
See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC97">checkout options</A>.

When you tag more than one file with the same tag you
can think about the tag as "a curve drawn through a

At some time in the past, the <CODE>*</CODE> versions were tagged.
You can think of the tag as a handle attached to the curve
drawn through the tagged revisions.  When you pull on
the handle, you get all the tagged revisions.  Another
way to look at it is that you "sight" through a set of
revisions that is "flat" along the tagged revisions,
like this:

Suppose that release 1.0 of tc has been made.  You are continuing to
develop tc, planning to create release 1.1 in a couple of months.  After a
while your customers start to complain about a fatal bug.  You check
out release 1.0 (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC51">Tags--Symbolic revisions</A>) and find the bug
(which turns out to have a trivial fix).  However, the current revision
of the sources are in a state of flux and are not expected to be stable
for at least another month.  There is no way to make a
bugfix release based on the newest sources.

</P>
<P>
The thing to do in a situation like this is to create a <EM>branch</EM> on
the revision trees for all the files that make up
release 1.0 of tc.  You can then make
modifications to the branch without disturbing the main trunk.  When the
modifications are finished you can select to either incorporate them on
the main trunk, or leave them on the branch.

The <CODE>rtag</CODE> command can be used to create a branch.
The <CODE>rtag</CODE> command is much like <CODE>tag</CODE>, but it
does not require that you have a working copy of the
module.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC126">rtag--Add a symbolic tag to a module</A>.  (You can also use the <CODE>tag</CODE>
command; see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC130">tag--Add a symbolic tag to checked out versions of files</A>).

<P>
The <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> flag makes <CODE>rtag</CODE> create a branch
(rather than just a symbolic revision name).  <SAMP>`-r
release-1-0'</SAMP> says that this branch should be rooted at the node (in
the revision tree) that corresponds to the tag
<SAMP>`release-1-0'</SAMP>.  Note that the numeric revision number that matches
<SAMP>`release-1-0'</SAMP> will probably be different from file to file.  The
name of the new branch is <SAMP>`release-1-0-patches'</SAMP>, and the
module affected is <SAMP>`tc'</SAMP>.

</P>

To fix the problem in release 1.0, you need a working
copy of the branch you just created.

As the output from the <CODE>status</CODE> command shows the branch
number is created by adding a digit at the tail of the revision number
it is based on.  (If <SAMP>`release-1-0'</SAMP> corresponds to revision 1.4, the
branch's revision number will be 1.4.2.  For obscure reasons CVS always
gives branches even numbers, starting at 2.

The sticky tags will remain on your working files until
you delete them with <SAMP>`cvs update -A'</SAMP>.  The
<SAMP>`-A'</SAMP> option retrieves the version of the file from
the head of the trunk, and forgets any sticky tags,
dates, or options.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX220"></A>
Sticky tags are not just for branches.  For example,
suppose that you want to avoid updating your working
directory, to isolate yourself from possibly
destabilizing changes other people are making.  You
can, of course, just refrain from running <CODE>cvs
update</CODE>.  But if you want to avoid updating only a
portion of a larger tree, then sticky tags can help.
If you check out a certain revision (such as 1.4) it
will become sticky.  Subsequent <CODE>cvs update</CODE> will
not retrieve the latest revision until you reset the
tag with <CODE>cvs update -A</CODE>.  Likewise, use of the
<SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> option to <CODE>update</CODE> or <CODE>checkout</CODE>
sets a <EM>sticky date</EM>, which, similarly, causes that
date to be used for future retrievals.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX221"></A>
<A NAME="IDX222"></A>
Many times you will want to retrieve an old version of
a file without setting a sticky tag.  The way to do
that is with the <SAMP>`-p'</SAMP> option to <CODE>checkout</CODE> or
<CODE>update</CODE>, which sends the contents of the file to
standard output.  For example, suppose you have a file
named <TT>`file1'</TT> which existed as revision 1.1, and
you then removed it (thus adding a dead revision 1.2).
Now suppose you want to add it again, with the same
contents it had previously.  Here is how to do it:

The branch 1.2.2 has been given the tag (symbolic name) <SAMP>`R1fix'</SAMP>.  The

where the starred line represents the merge from the
<SAMP>`R1fix'</SAMP> branch to the main trunk, as just

<P>
Now suppose that development continues on the
<SAMP>`R1fix'</SAMP> branch:

</P>

<PRE>
+-----+    +-----+    +-----+    +-----+    +-----+

</PRE>

<P>
and then you want to merge those new changes onto the
main trunk.  If you just use the <CODE>cvs update -j
R1fix m.c</CODE> command again, CVS will attempt to
merge again the changes which you have already merged,
which can have undesirable side effects.

</P>
<P>
So instead you need to specify that you only want to
merge the changes on the branch which have not yet been
merged into the trunk.  To do that you specify two
<SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> options, and CVS merges the changes from
the first revision to the second revision.  For
example, in this case the simplest way would be

</P>

<PRE>
cvs update -j 1.2.2.2 -j R1fix m.c    # Merge changes from 1.2.2.2 to the
                                      # head of the R1fix branch
</PRE>

<P>
The problem with this is that you need to specify the
1.2.2.2 revision manually.  A slightly better approach
might be to use the date the last merge was done:

</P>

<PRE>
cvs update -j R1fix:yesterday -j R1fix m.c
</PRE>

<P>
Better yet, tag the R1fix branch after every merge into
the trunk, and then use that tag for subsequent merges:

</P>

<PRE>
cvs update -j merged_from_R1fix_to_trunk -j R1fix m.c

example, files received from a third-party vendor), use
the <CODE>import</CODE> command instead.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC112">import--Import sources into CVS, using vendor branches</A>.

</P>
<P>
The added files are not placed in the source repository
until you use <CODE>commit</CODE> to make the change
permanent.  Doing an <CODE>add</CODE> on a file that was
removed with the <CODE>remove</CODE> command will undo the
effect of the <CODE>remove</CODE>, unless a <CODE>commit</CODE>
command intervened.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC62">Removing files from a module</A>, for an
example.

</P>
<P>
The <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> option specifies the default way that
this file will be checked out; for more information see
section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC81">Substitution modes</A>.

</P>
<P>
The <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> option specifies a description for the
file.  This description appears in the history log (if
it is enabled, see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC149">The history file</A>).  It will also be
saved in the version history inside the repository when
the file is committed.  The <CODE>log</CODE> command displays
this description.  The description can be changed using
<SAMP>`admin -t'</SAMP>.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC91">admin--Administration front end for rcs</A>.  If you omit the
<SAMP>`-m <VAR>description</VAR>'</SAMP> flag, an empty string will
be used.  You will not be prompted for a description.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
For example, the following commands add the file
<TT>`backend.c'</TT> to the repository:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs add backend.c
$ cvs commit -m "Early version. Not yet compilable." backend.c
</PRE>

<P>
When you add a file it is added only on the branch
which you are working on (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC50">Branches</A>).  You can
later merge the additions to another branch if you want
(see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC59">Merging can add or remove files</A>).

</P>
<P>
Modules change.  New files are added, and old files
disappear.  Still, you want to be able to retrieve an
exact copy of old releases of the module.

</P>
<P>
Here is what you can do to remove a file from a module,
but remain able to retrieve old revisions:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Make sure that you have not made any uncommitted
modifications to the file.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC14">Viewing differences</A>,
for one way to do that.  You can also use the
<CODE>status</CODE> or <CODE>update</CODE> command.  If you remove
the file without committing your changes, you will of
course not be able to retrieve the file as it was
immediately before you deleted it.

<LI>

Remove the file from your working copy of the module.
You can for instance use <CODE>rm</CODE>.

<LI>

Use <SAMP>`cvs remove <VAR>filename</VAR>'</SAMP> to tell CVS that
you really want to delete the file.

<LI>

Use <SAMP>`cvs commit <VAR>filename</VAR>'</SAMP> to actually
perform the removal of the file from the repository.
</UL>

<P>
When you commit the removal of the file, CVS
records the fact that the file no longer exists.  It is
possible for a file to exist on only some branches and
not on others, or to re-add another file with the same
name later.  CVS will correctly create or not create
the file, based on the <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> options
specified to <CODE>checkout</CODE> or <CODE>update</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX248"></A>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>cvs remove</B> <I>[<CODE>-lR</CODE>] files ...</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX249"></A>

</P>
<P>
Schedule file(s) to be removed from the repository
(files which have not already been removed from the
working directory are not processed).  This command
does not actually remove the file from the repository
until you commit the removal.  The <SAMP>`-R'</SAMP> option
(the default) specifies that it will recurse into
subdirectories; <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> specifies that it will not.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
Here is an example of removing several files:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cd test
$ rm ?.c
$ cvs remove
cvs remove: Removing .
cvs remove: scheduling a.c for removal
cvs remove: scheduling b.c for removal
cvs remove: use 'cvs commit' to remove these files permanently
$ cvs ci -m "Removed unneeded files"
cvs commit: Examining .
cvs commit: Committing .
</PRE>

<P>
If you change your mind you can easily resurrect the
file before you commit it, using the <CODE>add</CODE>
command.

</P>

<PRE>
$ ls
CVS   ja.h  oj.c
$ rm oj.c
$ cvs remove oj.c
cvs remove: scheduling oj.c for removal
cvs remove: use 'cvs commit' to remove this file permanently
$ cvs add oj.c
U oj.c
cvs add: oj.c, version 1.1.1.1, resurrected
</PRE>

<P>
If you realize your mistake before you run the
<CODE>remove</CODE> command you can use <CODE>update</CODE> to
resurrect the file:

</P>

<PRE>
$ rm oj.c
$ cvs update oj.c
cvs update: warning: oj.c was lost
U oj.c
</PRE>

<P>
When you remove a file it is added only on the branch
which you are working on (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC50">Branches</A>).  You can
later merge the additions to another branch if you want
(see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC59">Merging can add or remove files</A>).

If you modify a program to better fit your site, you
probably want to include your modifications when the next

this task.

</P>

<A NAME="IDX252"></A>

In the terminology used in CVS, the supplier of the
program is called a <EM>vendor</EM>.  The unmodified
distribution from the vendor is checked in on its own
branch, the <EM>vendor branch</EM>.  CVS reserves branch
1.1.1 for this use.

</P>
<P>
When you modify the source and commit it, your revision
will end up on the main trunk.  When a new release is
made by the vendor, you commit it on the vendor branch
and copy the modifications onto the main trunk.

</P>
<P>
Use the <CODE>import</CODE> command to create and update
the vendor branch.  After a successful <CODE>import</CODE>
the vendor branch is made the `head' revision, so
anyone that checks out a copy of the file gets that
revision.  When a local modification is committed it is
placed on the main trunk, and made the `head'
revision.

</P>
<P>
Use the <CODE>import</CODE> command to check in the sources
for the first time.  When you use the <CODE>import</CODE>
command to track third-party sources, the <EM>vendor
tag</EM> and <EM>release tags</EM> are useful.  The
<EM>vendor tag</EM> is a symbolic name for the branch
(which is always 1.1.1, unless you use the <SAMP>`-b
<VAR>branch</VAR>'</SAMP> flag---See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC113">import options</A>).  The
<EM>release tags</EM> are symbolic names for a particular
release, such as <SAMP>`FSF_0_04'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX256"></A>
Suppose you use <CODE>wdiff</CODE> (a variant of <CODE>diff</CODE>
that ignores changes that only involve whitespace), and
are going to make private modifications that you want
to be able to use even when new releases are made in
the future.  You start by importing the source to your
repository:

</P>

<PRE>
$ tar xfz wdiff-0.04.tar.gz
$ cd wdiff-0.04
$ cvs import -m "Import of FSF v. 0.04" fsf/wdiff FSF_DIST WDIFF_0_04
</PRE>

<P>
The vendor tag is named <SAMP>`FSF_DIST'</SAMP> in the above
example, and the only release tag assigned is
<SAMP>`WDIFF_0_04'</SAMP>.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC65" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC65">Updating a module with the import command</A></H2>

<P>
When a new release of the source arrives, you import it into the
repository with the same <CODE>import</CODE> command that you used to set up
the repository in the first place.  The only difference is that you
specify a different release tag this time.

</P>

<PRE>
$ tar xfz wdiff-0.05.tar.gz
$ cd wdiff-0.05
$ cvs import -m "Import of FSF v. 0.05" fsf/wdiff FSF_DIST WDIFF_0_05
</PRE>

<P>
For files that have not been modified locally, the newly created
revision becomes the head revision.  If you have made local
changes, <CODE>import</CODE> will warn you that you must merge the changes
into the main trunk, and tell you to use <SAMP>`checkout -j'</SAMP> to do so.

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs checkout -jFSF_DIST:yesterday -jFSF_DIST wdiff
</PRE>

<P>
The above command will check out the latest revision of
<SAMP>`wdiff'</SAMP>, merging the changes made on the vendor branch <SAMP>`FSF_DIST'</SAMP>
since yesterday into the working copy.  If any conflicts arise during
the merge they should be resolved in the normal way (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC40">Conflicts example</A>).  Then, the modified files may be committed.

</P>
<P>
Using a date, as suggested above, assumes that you do
not import more than one release of a product per
day. If you do, you can always use something like this
instead:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs checkout -jWDIFF_0_04 -jWDIFF_0_05 wdiff
</PRE>

<P>
In this case, the two above commands are equivalent.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC66" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC66">How to handle binary files with cvs import</A></H2>

</P>
<P>
Moving files to a different directory or renaming them
is not difficult, but some of the ways in which this
works may be non-obvious.  (Moving or renaming a
directory is even harder.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC71">Moving and renaming directories</A>).

</P>
<P>
The examples below assume that the file <VAR>old</VAR> is renamed to
<VAR>new</VAR>.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC68" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC68">The Normal way to Rename</A></H2>

<P>
The normal way to move a file is to copy <VAR>old</VAR> to
<VAR>new</VAR>, and then issue the normal CVS commands
to remove <VAR>old</VAR> from the repository, and add
<VAR>new</VAR> to it.  (Both <VAR>old</VAR> and <VAR>new</VAR> could
contain relative paths, for example <TT>`foo/bar.c'</TT>).

</P>

<PRE>
$ mv <VAR>old</VAR> <VAR>new</VAR>
$ cvs remove <VAR>old</VAR>
$ cvs add <VAR>new</VAR> 
$ cvs commit -m "Renamed <VAR>old</VAR> to <VAR>new</VAR>" <VAR>old</VAR> <VAR>new</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
This is the simplest way to move a file, it is not
error-prone, and it preserves the history of what was
done.  Note that to access the history of the file you
must specify the old or the new name, depending on what
portion of the history you are accessing.  For example,
<CODE>cvs log <VAR>old</VAR></CODE> will give the log up until the
time of the rename.

</P>
<P>
When <VAR>new</VAR> is committed its revision numbers will
start at 1.0 again, so if that bothers you, use the
<SAMP>`-r rev'</SAMP> option to commit (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC100">commit options</A>)

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC69" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC69">Moving the history file</A></H2>

<P>
This method is more dangerous, since it involves moving
files inside the repository.  Read this entire section
before trying it out!

</P>

<PRE>
$ cd $CVSROOT/<VAR>module</VAR>
$ mv <VAR>old</VAR>,v <VAR>new</VAR>,v
</PRE>

<P>
Advantages:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The log of changes is maintained intact.

<LI>

The revision numbers are not affected.
</UL>

<P>
Disadvantages:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Old releases of the module cannot easily be fetched from the
repository.  (The file will show up as <VAR>new</VAR> even
in revisions from the time before it was renamed).

<LI>

There is no log information of when the file was renamed.

<LI>

Nasty things might happen if someone accesses the history file
while you are moving it.  Make sure no one else runs any of the CVS
commands while you move it.
</UL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC70" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC70">Copying the history file</A></H2>

<P>
This way also involves direct modifications to the
repository.  It is safe, but not without drawbacks.

</P>

<PRE>
# Copy the RCS file inside the repository
$ cd $CVSROOT/<VAR>module</VAR>
$ cp <VAR>old</VAR>,v <VAR>new</VAR>,v
# Remove the old file

</PRE>

<P>
By removing the tags you will be able to check out old
revisions of the module.

</P>
<P>
Advantages:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Checking out old revisions works correctly, as long as
you use <SAMP>`-r<VAR>tag</VAR>'</SAMP> and not <SAMP>`-D<VAR>date</VAR>'</SAMP>
to retrieve the revisions.

<LI>

The log of changes is maintained intact.

<LI>

</UL>

<P>
Disadvantages:

<UL>
<LI>

You cannot easily see the history of the file across the rename.

<LI>

Unless you use the <SAMP>`-r rev'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC100">commit options</A>) flag when <VAR>new</VAR> is committed its revision
numbers will start at 1.0 again.

If you want to be able to retrieve old versions of the
module, you must move each file in the directory
with the CVS commands.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC68">The Normal way to Rename</A>.  The old, empty
directory will remain inside the repository, but it
will not appear in your workspace when you check out
the module in the future.

</P>
<P>
If you really want to rename or delete a directory, you
can do it like this:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Inform everyone who has a copy of the module that the
directory will be renamed.  They should commit all
their changes, and remove their working copies of the
module, before you take the steps below.

<LI>

Rename the directory inside the repository.


<PRE>
$ cd $CVSROOT/<VAR>module</VAR>
$ mv <VAR>old-dir</VAR> <VAR>new-dir</VAR>
</PRE>

<LI>

Fix the CVS administrative files, if necessary (for
instance if you renamed an entire module).

<LI>

Tell everyone that they can check out the module and continue
working.

</OL>

<P>
If someone had a working copy of the module the CVS commands will
cease to work for him, until he removes the directory
that disappeared inside the repository.

</P>
<P>
It is almost always better to move the files in the
directory instead of moving the directory.  If you move the
directory you are unlikely to be able to retrieve old
releases correctly, since they probably depend on the
name of the directories.

Once you have used CVS to store a version control

<H2><A NAME="SEC73" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC73">Log messages</A></H2>

<P>
Whenever you commit a file you specify a log message.

</P>

To look through the log messages which have been
specified for every revision which has been committed,
use the <CODE>cvs log</CODE> command (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC116">log--Print out log information for files</A>).

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC74" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC74">The history database</A></H2>

<P>
You can use the history file (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC149">The history file</A>) to
log various CVS actions.  To retrieve the
information from the history file, use the <CODE>cvs
history</CODE> command (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC110">history--Show status of files and users</A>).

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC75" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC75">User-defined logging</A></H2>

<P>
You can customize CVS to log various kinds of
actions, in whatever manner you choose.  These
mechanisms operate by executing a script at various
times.  The script might append a message to a file
listing the information and the programmer who created
it, or send mail to a group of developers, or, perhaps,
post a message to a particular newsgroup.  To log
commits, use the <TT>`loginfo'</TT> file (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC144">Loginfo</A>).
To log commits, checkouts, exports, and tags,
respectively, you can also use the <SAMP>`-i'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`-o'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP> options in the
modules file.  For a more flexible way of giving
notifications to various users, which requires less in
the way of keeping centralized scripts up to date, use
the <CODE>cvs watch add</CODE> command (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC45">Telling CVS to notify you</A>); this command is useful even if you are not
using <CODE>cvs watch on</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX266"></A>
The <TT>`taginfo'</TT> file defines programs to execute
when someone executes a <CODE>tag</CODE> or <CODE>rtag</CODE>
command.  The <TT>`taginfo'</TT> file has the standard form
for administrative files (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC136">Reference manual for the Administrative files</A>), where each line is a regular expression
followed by a command to execute.  The arguments passed
to the command are, in order, the <VAR>tagname</VAR>,
<VAR>operation</VAR> (<CODE>add</CODE> for <CODE>tag</CODE>,
<CODE>mov</CODE> for <CODE>tag -F</CODE>, and <CODE>del</CODE> for
<CODE>tag -d</CODE>), <VAR>repository</VAR>, and any remaining are
pairs of <VAR>filename</VAR> <VAR>revision</VAR>.  A non-zero
exit of the filter program will cause the tag to be
aborted.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>$Author$</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX273"></A>
 
The login name of the user who checked in the revision.

<A NAME="IDX274"></A>
<DT><CODE>$Date$</CODE>
<DD>
The date and time (UTC) the revision was checked in.

<A NAME="IDX275"></A>
<DT><CODE>$Header$</CODE>
<DD>
A standard header containing the full pathname of the

will normally never be locked when you use CVS.

<A NAME="IDX276"></A>
<DT><CODE>$Id$</CODE>

The login name of the user who locked the revision
(empty if not locked, and thus almost always useless

<A NAME="IDX279"></A>
<DT><CODE>$Log$</CODE>
<DD>
The log message supplied during commit, preceded by a
header containing the RCS filename, the revision
number, the author, and the date (UTC).  Existing log
messages are <EM>not</EM> replaced.  Instead, the new log
message is inserted after <CODE>$Log$</CODE>.
Each new line is prefixed with a <EM>comment leader</EM>
which RCS guesses from the file name extension.
It can be changed with <CODE>cvs admin -c</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC92">admin options</A>.  This keyword is useful for
accumulating a complete change log in a source file,
but for several reasons it can be problematic.
See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC82">Problems with the $Log$ keyword.</A>.

<A NAME="IDX280"></A>
<DT><CODE>$RCSfile$</CODE>
<DD>
The name of the RCS file without a path.

<A NAME="IDX281"></A>
<DT><CODE>$Revision$</CODE>
<DD>
The revision number assigned to the revision.

<A NAME="IDX282"></A>
<DT><CODE>$Source$</CODE>
<DD>
The full pathname of the RCS file.

<A NAME="IDX283"></A>
<DT><CODE>$State$</CODE>
<DD>
The state assigned to the revision.  States can be

</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC79" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC79">Using keywords</A></H2>

<P>
To include a keyword string you simply include the
relevant text string, such as <CODE>$Id$</CODE>, inside the
file, and commit the file.  CVS will automatically
expand the string as part of the commit operation.

</P>
<P>
It is common to embed <CODE>$</CODE>Id$ string in the
C source code.  This example shows the first few lines
of a typical file, after keyword substitution has been
performed:

</P>

<PRE>
static char *rcsid="$Id$";
/* The following lines will prevent <CODE>gcc</CODE> version 2.<VAR>x</VAR>
   from issuing an "unused variable" warning. */
#if __GNUC__ == 2
#define USE(var) static void * use_##var = (&#38;use_##var, (void *) &#38;var) 
USE (rcsid);
#endif
</PRE>

<P>
Even though a clever optimizing compiler could remove
the unused variable <CODE>rcsid</CODE>, most compilers tend
to include the string in the binary.  Some compilers
have a <CODE>#pragma</CODE> directive to include literal text
in the binary.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX284"></A>
The <CODE>ident</CODE> command (which is part of the RCS
package) can be used to extract keywords and their
values from a file.  This can be handy for text files,
but it is even more useful for extracting keywords from
binary files.

</P>

<PRE>
$ ident samp.c
samp.c:
     $Id$
$ gcc samp.c
$ ident a.out
a.out:
     $Id$
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX285"></A>
SCCS is another popular revision control system.
It has a command, <CODE>what</CODE>, which is very similar to
<CODE>ident</CODE> and used for the same purpose.  Many sites
without RCS have SCCS.  Since <CODE>what</CODE>
looks for the character sequence <CODE>@(#)</CODE> it is
easy to include keywords that are detected by either
command.  Simply prefix the RCS keyword with the
magic SCCS phrase, like this:

</P>

<PRE>
static char *id="@(#) $Id$";
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC80" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC80">Avoiding substitution</A></H2>

<P>
Keyword substitution has its disadvantages.  Sometimes
you might want the literal text string
<SAMP>`$'</SAMP>Author$ to appear inside a file without
RCS interpreting it as a keyword and expanding it
into something like <SAMP>`$'</SAMP>Author: ceder $.  

</P>
<P>
There is unfortunately no way to selectively turn off
keyword substitution.  You can use <SAMP>`-ko'</SAMP>
(see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC81">Substitution modes</A>) to turn off keyword
substitution entirely.

</P>
<P>
In many cases you can avoid using RCS keywords in
the source, even though they appear in the final
product.  For example, the source for this manual
contains <SAMP>`$@asis{}Author$'</SAMP> whenever the text
<SAMP>`$'</SAMP>Author$ should appear.  In <CODE>nroff</CODE>
and <CODE>troff</CODE> you can embed the null-character
<CODE>\&#38;</CODE> inside the keyword for a similar effect.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC81" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC81">Substitution modes</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX286"></A>
<A NAME="IDX287"></A>

</P>
<P>
Each file has a stored default substitution mode, and
each working directory copy of a file also has a
substitution mode.  The former is set by the <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP>
option to <CODE>cvs add</CODE> and <CODE>cvs admin</CODE>; the
latter is set by the -k or -A options to <CODE>cvs
checkout</CODE> or <CODE>cvs update</CODE>.  <CODE>cvs diff</CODE> also
has a <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> option.  For some examples,
See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC83">Handling binary files</A>.

</P>
<P>
The modes available are:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`-kkv'</SAMP>
<DD>
Generate keyword strings using the default form, e.g.
<CODE>$</CODE>Revision: 5.7 $ for the <CODE>Revision</CODE>
keyword.

<DT><SAMP>`-kkvl'</SAMP>
<DD>
Like <SAMP>`-kkv'</SAMP>, except that a locker's name is always
inserted if the given revision is currently locked.
This option is normally not useful when CVS is used.

<DT><SAMP>`-kk'</SAMP>
<DD>
Generate only keyword names in keyword strings; omit
their values.  For example, for the <CODE>Revision</CODE>
keyword, generate the string <CODE>$</CODE>Revision$
instead of <CODE>$</CODE>Revision: 5.7 $.  This option
is useful to ignore differences due to keyword
substitution when comparing different revisions of a
file.

<DT><SAMP>`-ko'</SAMP>
<DD>
Generate the old keyword string, present in the working
file just before it was checked in.  For example, for
the <CODE>Revision</CODE> keyword, generate the string
<CODE>$</CODE>Revision: 1.1 $ instead of
<CODE>$</CODE>Revision: 5.7 $ if that is how the
string appeared when the file was checked in.

<DT><SAMP>`-kb'</SAMP>
<DD>
Like <SAMP>`-ko'</SAMP>, but also inhibit conversion of line
endings between the canonical form in which they are
stored in the repository (linefeed only), and the form
appropriate to the operating system in use on the
client.  For systems, like unix, which use linefeed
only to terminate lines, this is the same as
<SAMP>`-ko'</SAMP>.  For more information on binary files, see
section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC83">Handling binary files</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`-kv'</SAMP>
<DD>
Generate only keyword values for keyword strings.  For
example, for the <CODE>Revision</CODE> keyword, generate the string
<CODE>5.7</CODE> instead of <CODE>$</CODE>Revision: 5.7 $.
This can help generate files in programming languages
where it is hard to strip keyword delimiters like
<CODE>$</CODE>Revision: $ from a string.  However,
further keyword substitution cannot be performed once
the keyword names are removed, so this option should be
used with care.

One often would like to use <SAMP>`-kv'</SAMP> with <CODE>cvs
export</CODE>---see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC108">export--Export sources from CVS, similar to checkout</A>.  But be aware that doesn't
handle an export containing binary files correctly.

</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC82" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC82">Problems with the $Log$ keyword.</A></H2>

<P>
The <CODE>$</CODE>Log$ keyword is somewhat
controversial.  As long as you are working on your
development system the information is easily accessible
even if you do not use the <CODE>$</CODE>Log$
keyword--just do a <CODE>cvs log</CODE>.  Once you export
the file the history information might be useless
anyhow.

</P>
<P>
A more serious concern is that RCS is not good at
handling <CODE>$</CODE>Log$ entries when a branch is
merged onto the main trunk.  Conflicts often result
from the merging operation.

</P>
<P>
People also tend to "fix" the log entries in the file
(correcting spelling mistakes and maybe even factual
errors).  If that is done the information from
<CODE>cvs log</CODE> will not be consistent with the
information inside the file.  This may or may not be a
problem in real life.

</P>
<P>
It has been suggested that the <CODE>$</CODE>Log$
keyword should be inserted <EM>last</EM> in the file, and
not in the files header, if it is to be used at all.
That way the long list of change messages will not
interfere with everyday source file browsing.

</P>


<H1><A NAME="SEC83" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC83">Handling binary files</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX288"></A>

</P>
<P>
There are two issues with using CVS to store
binary files.  The first is that CVS by default
convert line endings between the canonical form in
which they are stored in the repository (linefeed
only), and the form appropriate to the operating system
in use on the client (for example, carriage return
followed by line feed for Windows NT).

</P>
<P>
The second is that a binary file might happen to
contain data which looks like a keyword (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC77">Keyword substitution</A>), so keyword expansion must be turned
off.

</P>
<P>
The <SAMP>`-kb'</SAMP> option available with some CVS
commands insures that neither line ending conversion
nor keyword expansion will be done.  If you are using
an old version of RCS without this option, and you
are using an operating system, such as unix, which
terminates lines with linefeeds only, you can use
<SAMP>`-ko'</SAMP> instead; if you are on another operating
system, upgrade to a version of RCS, such as 5.7
or later, which supports <SAMP>`-kb'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
Here is an example of how you can create a new file
using the <SAMP>`-kb'</SAMP> flag:

</P>

<PRE>
$ echo '$Id$' &#62; kotest
$ cvs add -kb -m"A test file" kotest
$ cvs ci -m"First checkin; contains a keyword" kotest
</PRE>

<P>
If a file accidentally gets added without <SAMP>`-kb'</SAMP>,
one can use the <CODE>cvs admin</CODE> command to recover.
For example:

</P>

<PRE>
$ echo '$Id$' &#62; kotest
$ cvs add -m"A test file" kotest
$ cvs ci -m"First checkin; contains a keyword" kotest
$ cvs admin -kb kotest
$ cvs update -A kotest
$ cvs commit -m "make it binary" kotest  # For non-unix systems
</PRE>

<P>
When you check in the file <TT>`kotest'</TT> the keywords
are expanded.  (Try the above example, and do a
<CODE>cat kotest</CODE> after every command).  The <CODE>cvs
admin -kb</CODE> command sets the default keyword
substitution method for this file, but it does not
alter the working copy of the file that you have.  The
easiest way to get the unexpanded version of
<TT>`kotest'</TT> is <CODE>cvs update -A</CODE>.  If you need to
cope with line endings (that is, you are using a
CVS client on a non-unix system), then you need to
check in a new copy of the file, as shown by the
<CODE>cvs commit</CODE> command above.

</P>
<P>
However, in using <CODE>cvs admin -k</CODE> to change the
keyword expansion, be aware that the keyword expansion
mode is not version controlled.  This means that, for
example, that if you have a text file in old releases,
and a binary file with the same name in new releases,
CVS provides no way to check out the file in text
or binary mode depending on what version you are
checking out.  There is no good workaround for this
problem.

</P>
<P>
You can also set a default for whether <CODE>cvs add</CODE>
and <CODE>cvs import</CODE> treat a file as binary based on
its name; for example you could say that files who
names end in <SAMP>`.exe'</SAMP> are binary.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC138">The cvswrappers file</A>.

If you have read this far, you probably have a pretty

</P>
<P>
Your group should decide which policy to use regarding
commits.  Several policies are possible, and as your
experience with CVS grows you will probably find
out what works for you.

</P>
<P>
If you commit files too quickly you might commit files
that do not even compile.  If your partner updates his
working sources to include your buggy file, he will be
unable to compile the code.  On the other hand, other
persons will not be able to benefit from the
improvements you make to the code if you commit very
seldom, and conflicts will probably be more common.

</P>
<P>
It is common to only commit files after making sure
that they can be compiled.  Some sites require that the
files pass a test suite.  Policies like this can be
enforced using the commitinfo file
(see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC141">Commitinfo</A>), but you should think twice before
you enforce such a convention.  By making the
development environment too controlled it might become
too regimented and thus counter-productive to the real
goal, which is to get software written.

The overall format of all CVS commands is:

</P>

<PRE>
cvs [ cvs_options ] cvs_command [ command_options ] [ command_args ]
</PRE>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>cvs</CODE>
<DD>
The name of the CVS program.

<DT><CODE>cvs_options</CODE>
<DD>
Some options that affect all sub-commands of CVS.  These are
described below.

<DT><CODE>cvs_command</CODE>
<DD>
One of several different sub-commands.  Some of the commands have
aliases that can be used instead; those aliases are noted in the
reference manual for that command.  There are only two situations
where you may omit <SAMP>`cvs_command'</SAMP>: <SAMP>`cvs -H'</SAMP> elicits a
list of available commands, and <SAMP>`cvs -v'</SAMP> displays version
information on CVS itself.

<DT><CODE>command_options</CODE>
<DD>
Options that are specific for the command.

<DT><CODE>command_args</CODE>
<DD>
Arguments to the commands.
</DL>

<P>
There is unfortunately some confusion between
<CODE>cvs_options</CODE> and <CODE>command_options</CODE>.
<SAMP>`-l'</SAMP>, when given as a <CODE>cvs_option</CODE>, only
affects some of the commands.  When it is given as a
<CODE>command_option</CODE> is has a different meaning, and
is accepted by more commands.  In other words, do not
take the above categorization too seriously.  Look at
the documentation instead.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC88" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC88">Default options and the ~/.cvsrc file</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX300"></A>
<A NAME="IDX301"></A>

</P>
<P>
There are some <CODE>command_options</CODE> that are used so
often that you might have set up an alias or some other
means to make sure you always specify that option.  One
example (the one that drove the implementation of the
.cvsrc support, actually) is that many people find the
default output of the <SAMP>`diff'</SAMP> command to be very
hard to read, and that either context diffs or unidiffs
are much easier to understand.

</P>
<P>
The <TT>`~/.cvsrc'</TT> file is a way that you can add
default options to <CODE>cvs_commands</CODE> within cvs,
instead of relying on aliases or other shell scripts.

</P>
<P>
The format of the <TT>`~/.cvsrc'</TT> file is simple.  The
file is searched for a line that begins with the same
name as the <CODE>cvs_command</CODE> being executed.  If a
match is found, then the remainder of the line is split
up (at whitespace characters) into separate options and
added to the command arguments <EM>before</EM> any
options from the command line.

</P>
<P>
If a command has two names (e.g., <CODE>checkout</CODE> and
<CODE>co</CODE>), the official name, not necessarily the one
used on the command line, will be used to match against
the file.  So if this is the contents of the user's
<TT>`~/.cvsrc'</TT> file:

</P>

<PRE>
log -N
diff -u
update -P
co -P
</PRE>

<P>
the command <SAMP>`cvs checkout foo'</SAMP> would have the
<SAMP>`-P'</SAMP> option added to the arguments, as well as
<SAMP>`cvs co foo'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
With the example file above, the output from <SAMP>`cvs
diff foobar'</SAMP> will be in unidiff format.  <SAMP>`cvs diff
-c foobar'</SAMP> will provide context diffs, as usual.
Getting "old" format diffs would be slightly more
complicated, because <CODE>diff</CODE> doesn't have an option
to specify use of the "old" format, so you would need
<SAMP>`cvs -f diff foobar'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
In place of the command name you can use <CODE>cvs</CODE> to
specify global options (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC89">Global options</A>).  For
example the following line in <TT>`.cvsrc'</TT>

</P>

<PRE>
cvs -z6

<P>
causes CVS to use compression level 6

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-b <VAR>bindir</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX305"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX306"></A>
 
Use <VAR>bindir</VAR> as the directory where RCS programs are
located.  Overrides the setting of the <CODE>$RCSBIN</CODE> environment
variable and any precompiled directory.  This parameter should be
specified as an absolute pathname.

<A NAME="IDX307"></A>
<A NAME="IDX308"></A>
<DT><CODE>-T <VAR>tempdir</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Use <VAR>tempdir</VAR> as the directory where temporary files are
located.  Overrides the setting of the <CODE>$TMPDIR</CODE> environment
variable and any precompiled directory.  This parameter should be
specified as an absolute pathname.

<A NAME="IDX309"></A>
<A NAME="IDX310"></A>
<DT><CODE>-d <VAR>cvs_root_directory</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Use <VAR>cvs_root_directory</VAR> as the root directory
pathname of the repository.  Overrides the setting of
the <CODE>$CVSROOT</CODE> environment variable.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC15">The Repository</A>.

<A NAME="IDX311"></A>
<A NAME="IDX312"></A>
<DT><CODE>-e <VAR>editor</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Use <VAR>editor</VAR> to enter revision log information.  Overrides the
setting of the <CODE>$CVSEDITOR</CODE> and <CODE>$EDITOR</CODE> environment variables.

<DT><CODE>-f</CODE>
<DD>
Do not read the <TT>`~/.cvsrc'</TT> file.  This
option is most often used because of the
non-orthogonality of the CVS option set.  For
example, the <SAMP>`cvs log'</SAMP> option <SAMP>`-N'</SAMP> (turn off
display of tag names) does not have a corresponding
option to turn the display on.  So if you have
<SAMP>`-N'</SAMP> in the <TT>`~/.cvsrc'</TT> entry for <SAMP>`log'</SAMP>,
you may need to use <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> to show the tag names.

<DT><CODE>-H</CODE>
<DD>
Display usage information about the specified <SAMP>`cvs_command'</SAMP>
(but do not actually execute the command).  If you don't specify
a command name, <SAMP>`cvs -H'</SAMP> displays a summary of all the
commands available.

<DT><CODE>-l</CODE>
<DD>
Do not log the cvs_command in the command history (but execute it
anyway).  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC110">history--Show status of files and users</A>, for information on command history.

<A NAME="IDX313"></A>
<DT><CODE>-n</CODE>
<DD>
Do not change any files.  Attempt to execute the
<SAMP>`cvs_command'</SAMP>, but only to issue reports; do not remove,
update, or merge any existing files, or create any new files.

<DT><CODE>-Q</CODE>
<DD>
Cause the command to be really quiet; the command will only
generate output for serious problems.

<DT><CODE>-q</CODE>
<DD>
Cause the command to be somewhat quiet; informational messages,
such as reports of recursion through subdirectories, are
suppressed.

<A NAME="IDX314"></A>
<DT><CODE>-r</CODE>
<DD>
Make new working files files read-only.  Same effect
as if the <CODE>$CVSREAD</CODE> environment variable is set
(see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC151">All environment variables which affect CVS</A>).  The default is to
make working files writable, unless watches are on
(see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC43">Mechanisms to track who is editing files</A>).

<DT><CODE>-s <VAR>variable</VAR>=<VAR>value</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Set a user variable (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC150">Expansions in administrative files</A>).

<A NAME="IDX315"></A>
<DT><CODE>-t</CODE>
<DD>
Trace program execution; display messages showing the steps of
CVS activity.  Particularly useful with <SAMP>`-n'</SAMP> to explore the
potential impact of an unfamiliar command.

<DT><CODE>-v</CODE>
<DD>
Display version and copyright information for CVS.

<A NAME="IDX316"></A>
<A NAME="IDX317"></A>
<DT><CODE>-w</CODE>
<DD>
Make new working files read-write.  Overrides the
setting of the <CODE>$CVSREAD</CODE> environment variable.
Files are created read-write by default, unless <CODE>$CVSREAD</CODE> is
set or <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> is given.

<DT><CODE>-x</CODE>
<DD>
Encrypt all communication between the client and the
server.  Only has an effect on the CVS client.  As
of this writing, this is only implemented when using a
Kerberos connection (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC30">Direct connection with kerberos</A>).
Encryption support is not available by default; it must
be enabled using a special configure option,
<TT>`--enable-encryption'</TT>, when you build CVS.

<DT><CODE>-z <VAR>gzip-level</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Set the compression level.  Only has an effect on the
CVS client.

<SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> is available with the <CODE>checkout</CODE>,
<CODE>diff</CODE>, <CODE>export</CODE>, <CODE>history</CODE>,
<CODE>rdiff</CODE>, <CODE>rtag</CODE>, and <CODE>update</CODE> commands.
(The <CODE>history</CODE> command uses this option in a
slightly different way; see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC111">history options</A>).  Note
that when specifying a date like <SAMP>`3/31/92'</SAMP> it is
<CODE><VAR>month</VAR>/<VAR>day</VAR>/<VAR>year</VAR></CODE>.  So
<SAMP>`1/4/96'</SAMP> is January 4, not March 1.

Remember to quote the argument to the <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP>
flag so that your shell doesn't interpret spaces as
argument separators.  A command using the <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP>
flag can look like this:


<PRE>
$ cvs diff -D "1 hour ago" cvs.texinfo
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX325"></A>
<DT><CODE>-f</CODE>
<DD>
When you specify a particular date or tag to CVS commands, they
normally ignore files that do not contain the tag (or did not
exist prior to the date) that you specified.  Use the <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> option
if you want files retrieved even when there is no match for the
tag or date.  (The most recent revision of the file
will be used). 

<SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> is available with these commands: <CODE>checkout</CODE>,
<CODE>export</CODE>, <CODE>rdiff</CODE>, <CODE>rtag</CODE>, and <CODE>update</CODE>.

<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG>  The <CODE>commit</CODE> command also has a
<SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> option, but it has a different behavior for
that command.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC100">commit options</A>.

<DT><CODE>-H</CODE>
<DD>
Help; describe the options available for this command.  This is
the only option supported for all CVS commands.

<DT><CODE>-k <VAR>kflag</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Alter the default RCS processing of keywords.
See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC77">Keyword substitution</A>, for the meaning of
<VAR>kflag</VAR>.  Your <VAR>kflag</VAR> specification is
<EM>sticky</EM> when you use it to create a private copy
of a source file; that is, when you use this option
with the <CODE>checkout</CODE> or <CODE>update</CODE> commands,
CVS associates your selected <VAR>kflag</VAR> with the
file, and continues to use it with future update
commands on the same file until you specify otherwise.

The <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> option is available with the <CODE>add</CODE>,
<CODE>checkout</CODE>, <CODE>diff</CODE> and
<CODE>update</CODE> commands.

<DT><CODE>-l</CODE>
<DD>
Local; run only in current working directory, rather than
recursing through subdirectories.  

<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> this is not the same
as the overall <SAMP>`cvs -l'</SAMP> option, which you can specify to the
left of a cvs command!

Available with the following commands: <CODE>checkout</CODE>,
<CODE>commit</CODE>, <CODE>diff</CODE>, <CODE>export</CODE>, <CODE>log</CODE>,
<CODE>remove</CODE>, <CODE>rdiff</CODE>, <CODE>rtag</CODE>,
<CODE>status</CODE>, <CODE>tag</CODE>, and <CODE>update</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX326"></A>
<A NAME="IDX327"></A>
<DT><CODE>-m <VAR>message</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Use <VAR>message</VAR> as log information, instead of
invoking an editor.

Available with the following commands: <CODE>add</CODE>,
<CODE>commit</CODE> and <CODE>import</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-n</CODE>
<DD>
Do not run any checkout/commit/tag program.  (A program can be
specified to run on each of these activities, in the modules
database (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC137">The modules file</A>); this option bypasses it). 

<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> this is not the same as the overall <SAMP>`cvs -n'</SAMP>
option, which you can specify to the left of a cvs command!

Available with the <CODE>checkout</CODE>, <CODE>commit</CODE>, <CODE>export</CODE>,
and <CODE>rtag</CODE> commands.

<DT><CODE>-P</CODE>
<DD>
Prune (remove) directories that are empty after being updated, on
<CODE>checkout</CODE>, or <CODE>update</CODE>.  Normally, an empty directory
(one that is void of revision-controlled files) is left alone.
Specifying <SAMP>`-P'</SAMP> will cause these directories to be silently
removed from your checked-out sources.  This does not remove the
directory from the repository, only from your checked out copy.
Note that this option is implied by the <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP>
options of <CODE>checkout</CODE> and <CODE>export</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-p</CODE>
<DD>
Pipe the files retrieved from the repository to standard output,
rather than writing them in the current directory.  Available
with the <CODE>checkout</CODE> and <CODE>update</CODE> commands.

<DT><CODE>-W</CODE>
<DD>
Specify file names that should be filtered.  You can
use this option repeatedly.  The spec can be a file
name pattern of the same type that you can specify in
the <TT>`.cvswrappers'</TT> file.
Avaliable with the following commands: <CODE>import</CODE>,
and <CODE>update</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-r <VAR>tag</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Use the revision specified by the <VAR>tag</VAR> argument instead of the
default <EM>head</EM> revision.  As well as arbitrary tags defined
with the <CODE>tag</CODE> or <CODE>rtag</CODE> command, two special tags are
always available: <SAMP>`HEAD'</SAMP> refers to the most recent version
available in the repository, and <SAMP>`BASE'</SAMP> refers to the
revision you last checked out into the current working directory.

The tag specification is sticky when you use this
with <CODE>checkout</CODE> or <CODE>update</CODE> to make your own
copy of a file: CVS remembers the tag and continues to use it on
future update commands, until you specify otherwise (for more information
on sticky tags/dates, see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC54">Sticky tags</A>).  The
tag can be either a symbolic or numeric tag.
See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC51">Tags--Symbolic revisions</A>.

Specifying the <SAMP>`-q'</SAMP> global option along with the
<SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> command option is often useful, to suppress
the warning messages when the RCS history file
does not contain the specified tag.

<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> this is not the same as the overall `cvs -r' option,
which you can specify to the left of a cvs command!

<SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> is available with the <CODE>checkout</CODE>, <CODE>commit</CODE>,
<CODE>diff</CODE>, <CODE>history</CODE>, <CODE>export</CODE>, <CODE>rdiff</CODE>,
<CODE>rtag</CODE>, and <CODE>update</CODE> commands.

Synonym: rcs
</UL>

<P>
This is the CVS interface to assorted administrative RCS
facilities, documented in rcs(1).  <CODE>admin</CODE> simply passes
all its options and arguments to the <CODE>rcs</CODE> command; it does
no filtering or other processing.  This command <EM>does</EM> work
recursively, however, so extreme care should be used.

</P>
<P>
If there is a group whose name matches a compiled in
value which defaults to <CODE>cvsadmin</CODE>, only members
of that group can use <CODE>cvs admin</CODE>.  To disallow
<CODE>cvs admin</CODE> for all users, create a group with no
users in it.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC92" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC92">admin options</A></H3>

<P>
Not all valid <CODE>rcs</CODE> options are useful together
with CVS.  Some even makes it impossible to use
CVS until you undo the effect!

</P>
<P>
This description of the available options is based on
the <SAMP>`rcs(1)'</SAMP> man page, but modified to suit
readers that are more interrested in CVS than
RCS.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-A<VAR>oldfile</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Might not work together with CVS.  Append the
access list of <VAR>oldfile</VAR> to the access list of the
RCS file.

<DT><CODE>-a<VAR>logins</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Might not work together with CVS.  Append the
login names appearing in the comma-separated list
<VAR>logins</VAR> to the access list of the RCS file.

<DT><CODE>-b[<VAR>rev</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>
When used with bare RCS, this
option sets the default branch to <VAR>rev</VAR>; in
CVS sticky tags (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC54">Sticky tags</A>) are a better
way to decide which branch you want to work on.  With
CVS, this option can be used to control behavior
with respect to the vendor branch.

<DT><CODE>-c<VAR>string</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Useful with CVS.  Sets the comment leader to
<VAR>string</VAR>.  The comment leader is printed before
every log message line generated by the keyword
<CODE>$</CODE>Log$ (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC77">Keyword substitution</A>).
This is useful for programming languages without
multi-line comments.  RCS initially guesses the
value of the comment leader from the file name
extension when the file is first committed.

<DT><CODE>-e[<VAR>logins</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>
Might not work together with CVS.  Erase the login
names appearing in the comma-separated list
<VAR>logins</VAR> from the access list of the RCS file.  If
<VAR>logins</VAR> is omitted, erase the entire access list.

<DT><CODE>-I</CODE>
<DD>
Run interactively, even if the standard input is not a
terminal.

<DT><CODE>-i</CODE>
<DD>
Useless with CVS.  When using bare RCS, this
is used to create and initialize a new RCS file,
without depositing a revision.

<DT><CODE>-k<VAR>subst</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Useful with CVS.  Set the default keyword
substitution to <VAR>subst</VAR>.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC77">Keyword substitution</A>.  Giving an explicit <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> option to
<CODE>cvs update</CODE>, <CODE>cvs export</CODE>, or <CODE>cvs
checkout</CODE> overrides this default.

<DT><CODE>-l[<VAR>rev</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>
Lock the revision with number <VAR>rev</VAR>.  If a branch
is given, lock the latest revision on that branch.  If
<VAR>rev</VAR> is omitted, lock the latest revision on the
default branch.

This can be used in conjunction with the
<TT>`rcslock.pl'</TT> script in the <TT>`contrib'</TT>
directory of the CVS source distribution to
provide reserved checkouts (where only one user can be
editing a given file at a time).  See the comments in
that file for details (and see the <TT>`README'</TT> file
in that directory for disclaimers about the unsupported
nature of contrib).  According to comments in that
file, locking must set to strict (which is the default).

<DT><CODE>-L</CODE>
<DD>
Set locking to strict.  Strict locking means that the
owner of an RCS file is not exempt from locking for
checkin.  For use with CVS, strict locking must be
set; see the discussion under the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option above.

<A NAME="IDX329"></A>

<A NAME="IDX331"></A>
<A NAME="IDX332"></A>
<A NAME="IDX333"></A>
<DT><CODE>-m<VAR>rev</VAR>:<VAR>msg</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Replace the log message of revision <VAR>rev</VAR> with
<VAR>msg</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>-N<VAR>name</VAR>[:[<VAR>rev</VAR>]]</CODE>
<DD>
Act like <SAMP>`-n'</SAMP>, except override any previous
assignment of <VAR>name</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>-n<VAR>name</VAR>[:[<VAR>rev</VAR>]]</CODE>
<DD>
Associate the symbolic name <VAR>name</VAR> with the branch
or revision <VAR>rev</VAR>.  It is normally better to use
<SAMP>`cvs tag'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`cvs rtag'</SAMP> instead.  Delete the
symbolic name if both <SAMP>`:'</SAMP> and <VAR>rev</VAR> are
omitted; otherwise, print an error message if
<VAR>name</VAR> is already associated with another number.
If <VAR>rev</VAR> is symbolic, it is expanded before
association.  A <VAR>rev</VAR> consisting of a branch number
followed by a <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> stands for the current latest
revision in the branch.  A <SAMP>`:'</SAMP> with an empty
<VAR>rev</VAR> stands for the current latest revision on the
default branch, normally the trunk.  For example,
<SAMP>`rcs -n<VAR>name</VAR>: RCS/*'</SAMP> associates <VAR>name</VAR> with the
current latest revision of all the named RCS files;
this contrasts with <SAMP>`rcs -n<VAR>name</VAR>:$ RCS/*'</SAMP> which
associates <VAR>name</VAR> with the revision numbers
extracted from keyword strings in the corresponding
working files.

<A NAME="IDX334"></A>
<A NAME="IDX335"></A>
<A NAME="IDX336"></A>
<DT><CODE>-o<VAR>range</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Potentially useful, but dangerous, with CVS (see below).
Deletes (<EM>outdates</EM>) the revisions given by
<VAR>range</VAR>.  A range consisting of a single revision
number means that revision.  A range consisting of a
branch number means the latest revision on that branch.
A range of the form <SAMP>`<VAR>rev1</VAR>:<VAR>rev2</VAR>'</SAMP> means
revisions <VAR>rev1</VAR> to <VAR>rev2</VAR> on the same branch,
<SAMP>`:<VAR>rev</VAR>'</SAMP> means from the beginning of the
branch containing <VAR>rev</VAR> up to and including
<VAR>rev</VAR>, and <SAMP>`<VAR>rev</VAR>:'</SAMP> means from revision
<VAR>rev</VAR> to the end of the branch containing
<VAR>rev</VAR>.  None of the outdated revisions may have
branches or locks.

Due to the way CVS handles branches <VAR>rev</VAR>
cannot be specified symbolically if it is a branch.
See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC153">Magic branch numbers</A>, for an explanation.

Make sure that no-one has checked out a copy of the
revision you outdate.  Strange things will happen if he
starts to edit it and tries to check it back in.  For
this reason, this option is not a good way to take back
a bogus commit; commit a new revision undoing the bogus
change instead (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC58">Merging differences between any two revisions</A>).

<DT><CODE>-q</CODE>
<DD>
Run quietly; do not print diagnostics.

<DT><CODE>-s<VAR>state</VAR>[:<VAR>rev</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>
Useful with CVS.  Set the state attribute of the
revision <VAR>rev</VAR> to <VAR>state</VAR>.  If <VAR>rev</VAR> is a
branch number, assume the latest revision on that
branch.  If <VAR>rev</VAR> is omitted, assume the latest
revision on the default branch.  Any identifier is
acceptable for <VAR>state</VAR>.  A useful set of states is
<SAMP>`Exp'</SAMP> (for experimental), <SAMP>`Stab'</SAMP> (for
stable), and <SAMP>`Rel'</SAMP> (for released).  By default,
the state of a new revision is set to <SAMP>`Exp'</SAMP> when
it is created.  The state is visible in the output from
<VAR>cvs log</VAR> (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC116">log--Print out log information for files</A>), and in the
<SAMP>`$'</SAMP>Log$ and <SAMP>`$'</SAMP>State$ keywords
(see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC77">Keyword substitution</A>).  Note that CVS
uses the <CODE>dead</CODE> state for its own purposes; to
take a file to or from the <CODE>dead</CODE> state use
commands like <CODE>cvs remove</CODE> and <CODE>cvs add</CODE>, not
<CODE>cvs admin -s</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-t[<VAR>file</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>
Useful with CVS.  Write descriptive text from the
contents of the named <VAR>file</VAR> into the RCS file,
deleting the existing text.  The <VAR>file</VAR> pathname
may not begin with <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>.  If <VAR>file</VAR> is omitted,
obtain the text from standard input, terminated by
end-of-file or by a line containing <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> by itself.
Prompt for the text if interaction is possible; see
<SAMP>`-I'</SAMP>.  The descriptive text can be seen in the
output from <SAMP>`cvs log'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC116">log--Print out log information for files</A>).

<DT><CODE>-t-<VAR>string</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Similar to <SAMP>`-t<VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP>. Write descriptive text
from the <VAR>string</VAR> into the RCS file, deleting
the existing text.

<DT><CODE>-U</CODE>
<DD>
Set locking to non-strict.  Non-strict locking means
that the owner of a file need not lock a revision for
checkin.  For use with CVS, strict locking must be
set; see the discussion under the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option
above.

<DT><CODE>-u[<VAR>rev</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>
See the option <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> above, for a discussion of
using this option with CVS.  Unlock the revision
with number <VAR>rev</VAR>.  If a branch is given, unlock
the latest revision on that branch.  If <VAR>rev</VAR> is
omitted, remove the latest lock held by the caller.
Normally, only the locker of a revision may unlock it.
Somebody else unlocking a revision breaks the lock.
This causes a mail message to be sent to the original
locker.  The message contains a commentary solicited
from the breaker.  The commentary is terminated by
end-of-file or by a line containing <CODE>.</CODE> by itself.

<DT><CODE>-V<VAR>n</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Emulate RCS version <VAR>n</VAR>. Use -V<VAR>n</VAR> to make
an RCS file acceptable to RCS version <VAR>n</VAR>
by discarding information that would confuse version
<VAR>n</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>-x<VAR>suffixes</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Useless with CVS. Use <VAR>suffixes</VAR> to
characterize RCS files.

<P>
First, an example of how <EM>not</EM> to use the
<CODE>admin</CODE> command.  It is included to stress the
fact that this command can be quite dangerous unless
you know <EM>exactly</EM> what you are doing.

</P>
<P>
The <SAMP>`-o'</SAMP> option can be used to <EM>outdate</EM> old revisions
from the history file.  If you are short on disc this option
might help you.  But think twice before using it--there is no
way short of restoring the latest backup to undo this command!

</P>
<P>
The next line is an example of a command that you would
<EM>not</EM> like to execute.

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs admin -o:R_1_02 .
</PRE>

<P>
The above command will delete all revisions up to, and
including, the revision that corresponds to the tag
R_1_02.  But beware!  If there are files that have not
changed between R_1_02 and R_1_03 the file will have
<EM>the same</EM> numerical revision number assigned to
the tags R_1_02 and R_1_03.  So not only will it be
impossible to retrieve R_1_02; R_1_03 will also have to
be restored from the tapes!

Synopsis: checkout [options] modules...

Requires: repository.
<LI>

Changes: working directory.
<LI>

Synonyms: co, get
</UL>

<P>
Make a working directory containing copies of the
source files specified by <VAR>modules</VAR>.  You must execute
<CODE>checkout</CODE> before using most of the other CVS
commands, since most of them operate on your working
directory.

</P>
<P>
The <VAR>modules</VAR> part of the command are either
symbolic names for some
collection of source directories and files, or paths to
directories or files in the repository.  The symbolic
names are defined in the <SAMP>`modules'</SAMP> file.
See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC137">The modules file</A>.

</P>
<P>
Depending on the modules you specify, <CODE>checkout</CODE> may
recursively create directories and populate them with
the appropriate source files.  You can then edit these
source files at any time (regardless of whether other
software developers are editing their own copies of the
sources); update them to include new changes applied by
others to the source repository; or commit your work as
a permanent change to the source repository.

</P>
<P>
Note that <CODE>checkout</CODE> is used to create
directories.  The top-level directory created is always
added to the directory where <CODE>checkout</CODE> is
invoked, and usually has the same name as the specified
module.  In the case of a module alias, the created
sub-directory may have a different name, but you can be
sure that it will be a sub-directory, and that
<CODE>checkout</CODE> will show the relative path leading to
each file as it is extracted into your private work
area (unless you specify the <SAMP>`-Q'</SAMP> global option).

</P>
<P>
The files created by <CODE>checkout</CODE> are created
read-write, unless the <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> option to CVS
(see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC89">Global options</A>) is specified, the
<CODE>CVSREAD</CODE> environment variable is specified
(see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC151">All environment variables which affect CVS</A>), or a watch is in
effect for that file (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC43">Mechanisms to track who is editing files</A>).

</P>
<P>
Running <CODE>checkout</CODE> on a directory that was already
built by a prior <CODE>checkout</CODE> is also permitted, and
has the same effect as specifying the <SAMP>`-d'</SAMP> option
to the <CODE>update</CODE> command, that is, any new
directories that have been created in the repository
will appear in your work area.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC132">update--Bring work tree in sync with repository</A>.

<DT><CODE>-d <VAR>dir</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Create a directory called <VAR>dir</VAR> for the working
files, instead of using the module name.  Unless you
also use <SAMP>`-N'</SAMP>, the paths created under <VAR>dir</VAR>
will be as short as possible.

<DT><CODE>-j <VAR>tag</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
With two <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> options, merge changes from the
revision specified with the first <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option to
the revision specified with the second <SAMP>`j'</SAMP> option,
into the working directory.

With one <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option, merge changes from the
ancestor revision to the revision specified with the
<SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option, into the working directory.  The
ancestor revision is the common ancestor of the
revision which the working directory is based on, and
the revision specified in the <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option.

In addition, each -j option can contain an optional
date specification which, when used with branches, can
limit the chosen revision to one within a specific
date.  An optional date is specified by adding a colon
(:) to the tag:
<SAMP>`-j<VAR>Symbolic_Tag</VAR>:<VAR>Date_Specifier</VAR>'</SAMP>.

See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC55">Merging</A>.

<DT><CODE>-N</CODE>
<DD>
Only useful together with <SAMP>`-d <VAR>dir</VAR>'</SAMP>.  With this
option, CVS will not shorten module paths in your
working directory.  (Normally, CVS shortens paths as
much as possible when you specify an explicit target
directory).

<DT><CODE>-s</CODE>
<DD>
Like <SAMP>`-c'</SAMP>, but include the status of all modules,
and sort it by the status string.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC137">The modules file</A>, for
info about the <SAMP>`-s'</SAMP> option that is used inside the
modules file to set the module status.

Use <CODE>commit</CODE> when you want to incorporate changes
from your working source files into the source

</P>
<P>
If you don't specify particular files to commit, all of
the files in your working current directory are
examined.  <CODE>commit</CODE> is careful to change in the
repository only those files that you have really
changed.  By default (or if you explicitly specify the
<SAMP>`-R'</SAMP> option), files in subdirectories are also
examined and committed if they have changed; you can
use the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option to limit <CODE>commit</CODE> to the
current directory only.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>commit</CODE> verifies that the selected files are up
to date with the current revisions in the source
repository; it will notify you, and exit without
committing, if any of the specified files must be made
current first with <CODE>update</CODE> (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC132">update--Bring work tree in sync with repository</A>).
<CODE>commit</CODE> does not call the <CODE>update</CODE> command

When all is well, an editor is invoked to allow you to

and placed in the RCS history file inside the

<CODE>log</CODE> command; See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC116">log--Print out log information for files</A>.  You can specify the
log message on the command line with the <SAMP>`-m

<CODE>commit</CODE> also supports these options:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-F <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
This option is present in CVS releases 1.3-s3 and
later.  Read the log message from <VAR>file</VAR>, instead

This option is present in CVS 1.3-s3 and later releases
of CVS.  Note that this is not the standard behavior of
the <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> option as defined in See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC90">Common command options</A>.

Force CVS to commit a new revision even if you haven't
made any changes to the file.  If the current revision
of <VAR>file</VAR> is 1.7, then the following two commands
are equivalent:


<PRE>
$ cvs commit -f <VAR>file</VAR>

<H4><A NAME="SEC102" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC102">New major release number</A></H4>

<P>
When you make a major release of your product, you
might want the revision numbers to track your major
release number.  You should normally not care about
the revision numbers, but this is a thing that many
people want to do, and it can be done without doing any
harm.

</P>
<P>
To bring all your files up to the RCS revision 3.0
(including those that haven't changed), you might do:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs commit -r 3.0
</PRE>

<P>
Note that it is generally a bad idea to try to make the
RCS revision number equal to the current release number
of your product.  You should think of the revision
number as an internal number that the CVS package
maintains, and that you generally never need to care
much about.  Using the <CODE>tag</CODE> and <CODE>rtag</CODE>
commands you can give symbolic names to the releases
instead.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC130">tag--Add a symbolic tag to checked out versions of files</A> and See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC126">rtag--Add a symbolic tag to a module</A>.

</P>
<P>
Note that the number you specify with <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> must be
larger than any existing revision number.  That is, if
revision 3.0 exists, you cannot <SAMP>`cvs commit
-r 1.3'</SAMP>.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC103" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC103">Committing to a branch</A></H4>

<P>
You can commit to a branch revision (one that has an
even number of dots) with the <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> option.  To
create a branch revision, use the <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> option
of the <CODE>rtag</CODE> or <CODE>tag</CODE> commands (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC130">tag--Add a symbolic tag to checked out versions of files</A>
or see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC126">rtag--Add a symbolic tag to a module</A>).  Then, either <CODE>checkout</CODE> or
<CODE>update</CODE> can be used to base your sources on the
newly created branch.  From that point on, all
<CODE>commit</CODE> changes made within these working sources
will be automatically added to a branch revision,
thereby not disturbing main-line development in any
way.  For example, if you had to create a patch to the
1.2 version of the product, even though the 2.0 version
is already under development, you might do:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs rtag -b -r FCS1_2 FCS1_2_Patch product_module
$ cvs checkout -r FCS1_2_Patch product_module
$ cd product_module
[[ hack away ]]
$ cvs commit
</PRE>

<P>
This works automatically since the <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> option is
sticky.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC104" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC104">Creating the branch after editing</A></H4>

<P>
Say you have been working on some extremely
experimental software, based on whatever revision you
happened to checkout last week.  If others in your
group would like to work on this software with you, but
without disturbing main-line development, you could
commit your change to a new branch.  Others can then
checkout your experimental stuff and utilize the full
benefit of CVS conflict resolution.  The scenario might
look like:

</P>

<PRE>
[[ hacked sources are present ]]
$ cvs tag -b EXPR1
$ cvs update -r EXPR1
$ cvs commit
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>update</CODE> command will make the <SAMP>`-r
EXPR1'</SAMP> option sticky on all files.  Note that your
changes to the files will never be removed by the
<CODE>update</CODE> command.  The <CODE>commit</CODE> will
automatically commit to the correct branch, because the
<SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> is sticky.  You could also do like this:

</P>

<PRE>
[[ hacked sources are present ]]
$ cvs tag -b EXPR1
$ cvs commit -r EXPR1
</PRE>

<P>
but then, only those files that were changed by you
will have the <SAMP>`-r EXPR1'</SAMP> sticky flag.  If you hack
away, and commit without specifying the <SAMP>`-r EXPR1'</SAMP>
flag, some files may accidentally end up on the main
trunk.

</P>
<P>
To work with you on the experimental change, others
would simply do

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs checkout -r EXPR1 whatever_module

<P>
This command is a variant of <CODE>checkout</CODE>; use it

One often would like to use <SAMP>`-kv'</SAMP> with <CODE>cvs

in the two branches of development; use <SAMP>`checkout
-j'</SAMP> to reconcile the differences, as import instructs
you to do.

</P>
<P>
If CVS decides a file should be ignored
(see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC148">Ignoring files via cvsignore</A>), it does not import it and prints
<SAMP>`I '</SAMP> followed by the filename (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC114">import output</A>, for a
complete description of the output).

</P>
<P>
If the file <TT>`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvswrappers'</TT> exists,
any file whose names match the specifications in that
file will be treated as packages and the appropriate
filtering will be performed on the file/directory
before being imported, See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC138">The cvswrappers file</A>.

</P>
<P>
The outside source is saved in a first-level RCS
branch, by default 1.1.1.  Updates are leaves of this
branch; for example, files from the first imported
collection of source will be revision 1.1.1.1, then
files from the first imported update will be revision
1.1.1.2, and so on.

</P>
<P>
At least three arguments are required.
<VAR>repository</VAR> is needed to identify the collection
of source.  <VAR>vendortag</VAR> is a tag for the entire
branch (e.g., for 1.1.1).  You must also specify at
least one <VAR>releasetag</VAR> to identify the files at
the leaves created each time you execute <CODE>import</CODE>.

Specify a first-level branch other than 1.1.1.  Unless

What happens in that case, is that the tag will be
reset to 1.1.1.  Warning: This behavior might change
in the future.

<DT><CODE>-k <VAR>subst</VAR></CODE>

You can specify (using the standard <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> and

This command is meant to safely cancel the effect of
<SAMP>`cvs checkout'</SAMP>.  Since CVS doesn't lock files, it
isn't strictly necessary to use this command.  You can
always simply delete your working directory, if you
like; but you risk losing changes you may have
forgotten, and you leave no trace in the CVS history
file (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC149">The history file</A>) that you've abandoned your
checkout.

</P>
<P>
Use <SAMP>`cvs release'</SAMP> to avoid these problems.  This
command checks that no uncommitted changes are
present; that you are executing it from immediately
above a CVS working directory; and that the repository
recorded for your files is the same as the repository
defined in the module database.

<LI>

tag [-lR] [-b] [-c] [-d] symbolic_tag [files...]
<LI>

Requires: working directory, repository.
<LI>

Changes: repository.
<LI>

Synonym: freeze
</UL>

<P>
Use this command to assign symbolic tags to the nearest
repository versions to your working sources.  The tags
are applied immediately to the repository, as with
<CODE>rtag</CODE>, but the versions are supplied implicitly by the
CVS records of your working files' history rather than
applied explicitly.

</P>
<P>
One use for tags is to record a snapshot of the
current sources when the software freeze date of a
project arrives.  As bugs are fixed after the freeze
date, only those changed sources that are to be part of
the release need be re-tagged.

</P>
<P>
The symbolic tags are meant to permanently record which
revisions of which files were used in creating a
software distribution.  The <CODE>checkout</CODE> and
<CODE>update</CODE> commands allow you to extract an exact
copy of a tagged release at any time in the future,
regardless of whether files have been changed, added,
or removed since the release was tagged.

</P>
<P>
This command can also be used to delete a symbolic tag,
or to create a branch.  See the options section below.

</P>
<P>
If you attempt to use a tag name that already exists,
CVS will complain and not overwrite that tag.  Use
the <SAMP>`-F'</SAMP> option to force the new tag value.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC131" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC131">tag options</A></H3>

<P>
These standard options are supported by <CODE>tag</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC90">Common command options</A>, for a complete description of
them):

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-F</CODE>
<DD>
Overwrite an existing tag of the same name on a
different revision.  This option is new in CVS
1.4.  The old behavior is matched by <SAMP>`cvs tag -F'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>-l</CODE>
<DD>
Local; run only in current working directory.

<DT><CODE>-R</CODE>
<DD>
Commit directories recursively.  This is on by default.
</DL>

<P>
Two special options are available:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-b</CODE>
<DD>
The -b option makes the tag a branch tag
(see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC50">Branches</A>), allowing concurrent, isolated
development.  This is most useful for creating a patch
to a previously released software distribution.

<DT><CODE>-c</CODE>
<DD>
The -c option checks that all files which are to be tagged are
unmodified.  This can be used to make sure that you can reconstruct the
current file contents.

<DT><CODE>-d</CODE>
<DD>
Delete a tag.

If you use <SAMP>`cvs tag -d symbolic_tag'</SAMP>, the symbolic
tag you specify is deleted instead of being added.
Warning: Be very certain of your ground before you
delete a tag; doing this permanently discards some
historical information, which may later turn out to
be valuable.

See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC54">Sticky tags</A>, for more information on sticky tags/dates.

<DT><CODE>-f</CODE>
<DD>
Only useful with the <SAMP>`-D <VAR>date</VAR>'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-r
<VAR>tag</VAR>'</SAMP> flags.  If no matching revision is found,
retrieve the most recent revision (instead of ignoring
the file).

<DT><CODE>-k <VAR>kflag</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Process RCS keywords according to <VAR>kflag</VAR>.  See
co(1).  This option is sticky; future updates of
this file in this working directory will use the same
<VAR>kflag</VAR>.  The <CODE>status</CODE> command can be viewed

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-A</CODE>
<DD>
Reset any sticky tags, dates, or <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> options.
See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC54">Sticky tags</A>, for more information on sticky tags/dates.

<DT><CODE>-d</CODE>
<DD>
Create any directories that exist in the repository if
they're missing from the working directory.  Normally,
<CODE>update</CODE> acts only on directories and files that
were already enrolled in your working directory.  

This is useful for updating directories that were
created in the repository since the initial checkout;
but it has an unfortunate side effect.  If you
deliberately avoided certain directories in the
repository when you created your working directory
(either through use of a module name or by listing
explicitly the files and directories you wanted on the
command line), then updating with <SAMP>`-d'</SAMP> will create
those directories, which may not be what you want.

<DT><CODE>-I <VAR>name</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Ignore files whose names match <VAR>name</VAR> (in your
working directory) during the update.  You can specify
<SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> more than once on the command line to specify
several files to ignore.  Use <SAMP>`-I !'</SAMP> to avoid
ignoring any files at all.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC148">Ignoring files via cvsignore</A>, for other
ways to make CVS ignore some files.

<DT><CODE>-W<VAR>spec</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Specify file names that should be filtered during
update.  You can use this option repeatedly.

<VAR>spec</VAR> can be a file name pattern of the same type
that you can specify in the <TT>`.cvswrappers'</TT>
file. See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC138">The cvswrappers file</A>.

<DT><CODE>-j<VAR>revision</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
With two <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> options, merge changes from the
revision specified with the first <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option to
the revision specified with the second <SAMP>`j'</SAMP> option,
into the working directory.

With one <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option, merge changes from the
ancestor revision to the revision specified with the
<SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option, into the working directory.  The
ancestor revision is the common ancestor of the
revision which the working directory is based on, and
the revision specified in the <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option.

In addition, each -j option can contain an optional
date specification which, when used with branches, can
limit the chosen revision to one within a specific
date.  An optional date is specified by adding a colon
(:) to the tag:
<SAMP>`-j<VAR>Symbolic_Tag</VAR>:<VAR>Date_Specifier</VAR>'</SAMP>.

<CODE>update</CODE> and <CODE>checkout</CODE> keep you informed of
its progress by printing a line for each file, preceded
by one character indicating the status of the file:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>U <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The file was brought up to date with respect to the
repository.  This is done for any file that exists in
the repository but not in your source, and for files
that you haven't changed but are not the most recent
versions available in the repository.

<DT><CODE>A <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The file has been added to your private copy of the
sources, and will be added to the source repository
when you run <CODE>commit</CODE> on the file.  This is a
reminder to you that the file needs to be committed.

<DT><CODE>R <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The file has been removed from your private copy of the
sources, and will be removed from the source repository
when you run <CODE>commit</CODE> on the file.  This is a
reminder to you that the file needs to be committed.

<DT><CODE>M <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The file is modified in  your  working  directory.

<SAMP>`M'</SAMP> can indicate one of two states for a file
you're working on: either there were no modifications
to the same file in the repository, so that your file
remains as you last saw it; or there were modifications
in the repository as well as in your copy, but they
were merged successfully, without conflict, in your
working directory.

CVS will print some messages if it merges your work,
and a backup copy of your working file (as it looked
before you ran <CODE>update</CODE>) will be made.  The exact
name of that file is printed while <CODE>update</CODE> runs.

<DT><CODE>C <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX356"></A>
<A NAME="IDX357"></A>
A conflict was detected while trying to merge your
changes to <VAR>file</VAR> with changes from the source
repository.  <VAR>file</VAR> (the copy in your working
directory) is now the output of the rcsmerge(1) command
on the two revisions; an unmodified copy of your file
is also in your working directory, with the name
<TT>`.#<VAR>file</VAR>.<VAR>revision</VAR>'</TT> where <VAR>revision</VAR>
is the RCS revision that your modified file started
from.  Resolve the conflict as described in
section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC40">Conflicts example</A>
(Note that some systems automatically purge
files that begin with <TT>`.#'</TT> if they have not been
accessed for a few days.  If you intend to keep a copy
of your original file, it is a very good idea to rename
it.)  Under VMS, the file name starts with
<TT>`__'</TT> rather than <TT>`.#'</TT>.

<DT><CODE>? <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<VAR>file</VAR> is in your working directory, but does not
correspond to anything in the source repository, and is
not in the list of files for CVS to ignore (see the
description of the <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> option, and
see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC148">Ignoring files via cvsignore</A>).

Note that no warning message like this is printed for
spurious directories that CVS encounters.  The
directory, and all its contents, are silently ignored.

Inside the repository, in the directory
<TT>`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT'</TT>, there are a number of
supportive files for CVS.  You can use CVS in a limited
fashion without any of them, but if they are set up
properly they can help make life easier.  For a
discussion of how to edit them, See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC20">The administrative files</A>.

</P>
<P>
The most important of these files is the <TT>`modules'</TT>
file, which defines the modules inside the repository.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC137" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC137">The modules file</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX362"></A>
<A NAME="IDX363"></A>

</P>
<P>
The <TT>`modules'</TT> file records your definitions of
names for collections of source code.  CVS will
use these definitions if you use CVS to update the
modules file (use normal commands like <CODE>add</CODE>,
<CODE>commit</CODE>, etc).

</P>
<P>
The <TT>`modules'</TT> file may contain blank lines and
comments (lines beginning with <SAMP>`#'</SAMP>) as well as
module definitions.  Long lines can be continued on the
next line by specifying a backslash (<SAMP>`\'</SAMP>) as the
last character on the line.

</P>
<P>
A module definition is a single line of the
<TT>`modules'</TT> file, in either of two formats.  In both
cases, <VAR>mname</VAR> represents the symbolic module name,
and the remainder of the line is its definition.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE><VAR>mname</VAR> -a <VAR>aliases</VAR>...</CODE>
<DD>
This represents the simplest way of defining a module
<VAR>mname</VAR>.  The <SAMP>`-a'</SAMP> flags the definition as a
simple alias: CVS will treat any use of <VAR>mname</VAR> (as
a command argument) as if the list of names
<VAR>aliases</VAR> had been specified instead.
<VAR>aliases</VAR> may contain either other module names or
paths.  When you use paths in aliases, <CODE>checkout</CODE>
creates all intermediate directories in the working
directory, just as if the path had been specified
explicitly in the CVS arguments.

<DT><CODE><VAR>mname</VAR> [ options ] <VAR>dir</VAR> [ <VAR>files</VAR>... ] [ &#38;<VAR>module</VAR>... ]</CODE>
<DD>
In the simplest case, this form of module definition
reduces to <SAMP>`<VAR>mname</VAR> <VAR>dir</VAR>'</SAMP>.  This defines
all the files in directory <VAR>dir</VAR> as module mname.
<VAR>dir</VAR> is a relative path (from <CODE>$CVSROOT</CODE>) to a
directory of source in the source repository.  In this
case, on checkout, a single directory called
<VAR>mname</VAR> is created as a working directory; no
intermediate directory levels are used by default, even
if <VAR>dir</VAR> was a path involving several directory
levels.

By explicitly specifying files in the module definition
after <VAR>dir</VAR>, you can select particular files from
directory <VAR>dir</VAR>.  The sample definition for
<SAMP>`modules'</SAMP> is an example of a module defined with a
single file from a particular directory.  Here is
another example:


<PRE>
m4test  unsupported/gnu/m4 foreach.m4 forloop.m4
</PRE>

With this definition, executing <SAMP>`cvs checkout
m4test'</SAMP> will create a single working directory
<TT>`m4test'</TT> containing the two files listed, which
both come from a common directory several levels deep
in the CVS source repository.

A module definition can refer to other modules by
including <SAMP>`&#38;<VAR>module</VAR>'</SAMP> in its definition.
<CODE>checkout</CODE> creates a subdirectory for each such
module, in your working directory.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-d <VAR>name</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Name the working directory something other than the
module name.

<A NAME="IDX364"></A>
<DT><CODE>-e <VAR>prog</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Specify a program <VAR>prog</VAR> to run whenever files in a
module are exported.  <VAR>prog</VAR> runs with a single
argument, the module name.

<A NAME="IDX365"></A>
<DT><CODE>-i <VAR>prog</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Specify a program <VAR>prog</VAR> to run whenever files in a

argument, the full pathname of the affected directory
in a source repository.  The <TT>`commitinfo'</TT>,
<TT>`loginfo'</TT>, and <TT>`editinfo'</TT> files provide other
ways to call a program on commit.

<A NAME="IDX366"></A>
<DT><CODE>-o <VAR>prog</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Specify a program <VAR>prog</VAR> to run whenever files in a
module are checked out.  <VAR>prog</VAR> runs with a single
argument, the module name.

<A NAME="IDX367"></A>
<A NAME="IDX368"></A>
<DT><CODE>-s <VAR>status</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Assign a status to the module.  When the module file is
printed with <SAMP>`cvs checkout -s'</SAMP> the modules are
sorted according to primarily module status, and
secondarily according to the module name.  This option
has no other meaning.  You can use this option for
several things besides status: for instance, list the
person that is responsible for this module.

<A NAME="IDX369"></A>
<DT><CODE>-t <VAR>prog</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Specify a program <VAR>prog</VAR> to run whenever files in a
module are tagged with <CODE>rtag</CODE>.  <VAR>prog</VAR> runs
with two arguments: the module name and the symbolic
tag specified to <CODE>rtag</CODE>.  There is no way to
specify a program to run when <CODE>tag</CODE> is executed.

<A NAME="IDX370"></A>
<DT><CODE>-u <VAR>prog</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Specify a program <VAR>prog</VAR> to run whenever <SAMP>`cvs

<P>
Wrappers allow you to set a hook which transforms files on
their way in and out of CVS.  Most or all of the
wrappers features do not work with client/server CVS.

</P>
<P>
The file <TT>`cvswrappers'</TT> defines the script that will be
run on a file when its name matches a regular
expresion. There are two scripts that can be run on a
file or directory. One script is executed on the file/directory
before being checked into the repository (this is denoted
with the <CODE>-t</CODE> flag) and the other when the file is
checked out of the repository (this is denoted with the
<CODE>-f</CODE> flag)

</P>
<P>
The <TT>`cvswrappers'</TT> also has a <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> option to
specify the merge methodology that should be used when
the file is updated.  <CODE>MERGE</CODE> means the usual
CVS behavior: try to merge the files (this
generally will not work for binary files).  <CODE>COPY</CODE>
means that <CODE>cvs update</CODE> will merely copy one
version over the other, and require the user using
mechanisms outside CVS, to insert any necessary
changes.
The <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> wrapper option only affects behavior when
merging is done on update; it does not affect how files
are stored.  See See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC83">Handling binary files</A>, for more on
binary files.

</P>
<P>
The basic format of the file <TT>`cvswrappers'</TT> is:

</P>

<PRE>
wildcard     [option value][option value]...

where option is one of
-f           from cvs filter         value: path to filter
-t           to cvs filter           value: path to filter
-m           update methodology      value: MERGE or COPY
-k           keyword expansion       value: expansion mode

and value is a single-quote delimited value.
</PRE>


<PRE>
*.nib    -f 'unwrap %s' -t 'wrap %s %s' -m 'COPY'
*.c      -t 'indent %s %s'
</PRE>

<P>
The above example of a <TT>`cvswrappers'</TT> file
states that all files/directories that end with a <CODE>.nib</CODE>
should be filtered with the <TT>`wrap'</TT> program before
checking the file into the repository. The file should
be filtered though the <TT>`unwrap'</TT> program when the
file is checked out of the repository. The
<TT>`cvswrappers'</TT> file also states that a <CODE>COPY</CODE>
methodology should be used when updating the files in
the repository (that is no merging should be performed).

</P>
<P>
The last example line says that all files that end with
a <CODE>*.c</CODE> should be filtered with <TT>`indent'</TT>
before being checked into the repository. Unlike the previous
example no filtering of the <CODE>*.c</CODE> file is done when
it is checked out of the repository.
The <CODE>-t</CODE> filter is called with two arguments,
the first is the name of the file/directory to filter
and the second is the pathname to where the resulting
filtered file should be placed.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>-f</CODE> filter is called with one argument,
which is the name of the file to filter from. The end
result of this filter will be a file in the users directory
that they can work on as they normally would.

</P>
<P>
For another example, the following command imports a
directory, treating files whose name ends in
<SAMP>`.exe'</SAMP> as binary:

</P>

<PRE>
cvs import -I ! -W "*.exe -k 'b'" first-dir vendortag reltag

The <SAMP>`-i'</SAMP> flag in the <TT>`modules'</TT> file can be
used to run a certain program whenever files are
committed (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC137">The modules file</A>).  The files described in
this section provide other, more flexible, ways to run
programs whenever something is committed.

</P>
<P>
There are three kind of programs that can be run on
commit.  They are specified in files in the repository,
as described below.  The following table summarizes the
file names and the purpose of the corresponding
programs.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><TT>`commitinfo'</TT>
<DD>
The program is responsible for checking that the commit
is allowed.  If it exits with a non-zero exit status
the commit will be aborted.

<DT><TT>`editinfo'</TT>
<DD>
The specified program is used to edit the log message,
and possibly verify that it contains all required
fields.  This is most useful in combination with the
<TT>`rcsinfo'</TT> file, which can hold a log message
template (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC147">Rcsinfo</A>).

<DT><TT>`loginfo'</TT>
<DD>
The specified program is called when the commit is
complete.  It receives the log message and some
additional information and can store the log message in
a file, or mail it to appropriate persons, or maybe
post it to a local newsgroup, or...  Your
imagination is the limit!

programs are used for pre-commit checking to verify
that the modified, added and removed files are really
ready to be committed.  This could be used, for
instance, to verify that the changed files conform to
to your site's standards for coding practice.

</P>
<P>
As mentioned earlier, each line in the
<TT>`commitinfo'</TT> file consists of a regular expression
and a command-line template.  The template can include
a program name and any number of arguments you wish to
supply to it.  The full path to the current source
repository is appended to the template, followed by the
file names of any files involved in the commit (added,
removed, and modified files).

</P>
<P>
The first line with a regular expression matching the
relative path to the module will be used.  If the
command returns a non-zero exit status the commit will
be aborted.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX381"></A>
If the repository name does not match any of the
regular expressions in this file, the <SAMP>`DEFAULT'</SAMP>
line is used, if it is specified.

</P>

<A NAME="IDX382"></A>
All occurances of the name <SAMP>`ALL'</SAMP> appearing as a

<P>
Note: when CVS is accessing a remote repository,

If you want to make sure that all log messages look the
same way, you can use the <TT>`editinfo'</TT> file to
specify a program that is used to edit the log message.
This program could be a custom-made editor that always
enforces a certain style of the log message, or maybe a
simple shell script that calls an editor, and checks
that the entered message contains the required fields.

</P>
<P>
If no matching line is found in the <TT>`editinfo'</TT>
file, the editor specified in the environment variable
<CODE>$CVSEDITOR</CODE> is used instead.  If that variable is
not set, then the environment variable <CODE>$EDITOR</CODE>
is used instead.  If that variable is not
set a precompiled default, normally <CODE>vi</CODE>, will be
used.

</P>
<P>
The <TT>`editinfo'</TT> file is often most useful together
with the <TT>`rcsinfo'</TT> file, which can be used to
specify a log message template.

</P>
<P>
Each line in the <TT>`editinfo'</TT> file consists of a
regular expression and a command-line template.  The
template must include a program name, and can include
any number of arguments.  The full path to the current
log message template file is appended to the template.

</P>
<P>
One thing that should be noted is that the <SAMP>`ALL'</SAMP>
keyword is not supported.  If more than one matching
line is found, the first one is used.  This can be
useful for specifying a default edit script in a
module, and then overriding it in a subdirectory.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX387"></A>
If the repository name does not match any of the
regular expressions in this file, the <SAMP>`DEFAULT'</SAMP>
line is used, if it is specified.

</P>
<P>
If the edit script exits with a non-zero exit status,
the commit is aborted.

</P>
<P>
Note: when CVS is accessing a remote repository,
or when the <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-F'</SAMP> options to <CODE>cvs
commit</CODE> are used, <TT>`editinfo'</TT> will not be consulted.
There is no good workaround for this.

It is often useful to maintain a directory tree which
contains files which correspond to the latest version
in the repository.  For example, other developers might
want to refer to the latest sources without having to
check them out, or you might be maintaining a web site
with CVS and want every checkin to cause the files
used by the web server to be updated.

</P>
<P>
The way to do this is by having loginfo invoke
<CODE>cvs update</CODE>.  Doing so in the naive way will
cause a problem with locks, so the <CODE>cvs update</CODE>
must be run in the background.
Here is an example (this should all be on one line):

</P>

^cyclic-pages		(date; cat; (sleep 2; cd /u/www/local-docs;

The <TT>`rcsinfo'</TT> file can be used to specify a form to

<TT>`editinfo'</TT>, <TT>`commitinfo'</TT> and <TT>`loginfo'</TT>
files.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC140">The common syntax</A>.  Unlike the other files the second
part is <EM>not</EM> a command-line template.  Instead,
the part after the regular expression should be a full pathname to
a file containing the log message template.

</P>
<P>
If the repository name does not match any of the
regular expressions in this file, the <SAMP>`DEFAULT'</SAMP>
line is used, if it is specified.

</P>
<P>
All occurances of the name <SAMP>`ALL'</SAMP> appearing as a
regular expression are used in addition to the first

</P>
<P>
The log message template will be used as a default log
message.  If you specify a log message with <SAMP>`cvs
commit -m <VAR>message</VAR>'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`cvs commit -f
<VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP> that log message will override the
template.

</P>

When CVS is accessing a remote repository,
the contents of <TT>`rcsinfo'</TT> at the time a directory

There are certain file names that frequently occur
inside your working copy, but that you don't want to
put under CVS control.  Examples are all the object
files that you get while you compile your sources.
Normally, when you run <SAMP>`cvs update'</SAMP>, it prints a
line for each file it encounters that it doesn't know
about (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC134">update output</A>).

</P>
<P>
CVS has a list of files (or sh(1) file name patterns)
that it should ignore while running <CODE>update</CODE>,
<CODE>import</CODE> and <CODE>release</CODE>.
This list is constructed in the following way.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The list is initialized to include certain file name
patterns: names associated with CVS
administration, or with other common source control
systems; common names for patch files, object files,
archive files, and editor backup files; and other names
that are usually artifacts of assorted utilities.
Currently, the default list of ignored file name
patterns is:

<A NAME="IDX402"></A>
<A NAME="IDX403"></A>

<PRE>
    RCS     SCCS    CVS     CVS.adm
    RCSLOG  cvslog.*

    *.a     *.olb   *.o     *.obj   *.so    *.exe
    *.Z     *.elc   *.ln  
    core
</PRE>

<LI>

The per-repository list in
<TT>`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvsignore'</TT> is appended to
the list, if that file exists.

<LI>

The per-user list in <TT>`.cvsignore'</TT> in your home
directory is appended to the list, if it exists.

<LI>

Any entries in the environment variable
<CODE>$CVSIGNORE</CODE> is appended to the list.

<LI>

Any <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> options given to CVS is appended.

<LI>

As CVS traverses through your directories, the contents
of any <TT>`.cvsignore'</TT> will be appended to the list.
The patterns found in <TT>`.cvsignore'</TT> are only valid
for the directory that contains them, not for
any sub-directories.
</UL>

<P>
In any of the 5 places listed above, a single
exclamation mark (<SAMP>`!'</SAMP>) clears the ignore list.
This can be used if you want to store any file which
normally is ignored by CVS.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC149" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC149">The history file</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX404"></A>
<A NAME="IDX405"></A>

</P>
<P>
The file <TT>`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/history'</TT> is used
to log information for the <CODE>history</CODE> command
(see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC110">history--Show status of files and users</A>).  This file must be created to turn
on logging.  This is done automatically if the
<CODE>cvs init</CODE> command is used to set up the
repository (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC23">Creating a repository</A>).

</P>
<P>
The file format of the <TT>`history'</TT> file is
documented only in comments in the CVS source
code, but generally programs should use the <CODE>cvs
history</CODE> command to access it anyway, in case the
format changes with future releases of CVS.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC150" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC150">Expansions in administrative files</A></H2>

<P>
Sometimes in writing an administrative file, you might
want the file to be able to know various things based
on environment CVS is running in.  There are
several mechanisms to do that.

</P>
<P>
To find the home directory of the user running CVS
(from the <CODE>HOME</CODE> environment variable), use
<SAMP>`~'</SAMP> followed by <SAMP>`/'</SAMP> or the end of the line.
Likewise for the home directory of <VAR>user</VAR>, use
<SAMP>`~<VAR>user</VAR>'</SAMP>.  These variables are expanded on
the server machine, and don't get any resonable
expansion if pserver (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC26">Direct connection with password authentication</A>)
is in used; therefore user variables (see below) may be
a better choice to customize behavior based on the user
running CVS.

</P>
<P>
One may want to know about various pieces of
information internal to CVS.  A CVS internal
variable has the syntax <CODE>${<VAR>variable</VAR>}</CODE>,
where <VAR>variable</VAR> starts with a letter and consists
of alphanumberic characters and <SAMP>`_'</SAMP>.  If the
character following <VAR>variable</VAR> is a
non-alphanumeric character other than <SAMP>`_'</SAMP>, the
<SAMP>`{'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`}'</SAMP> can be omitted.  The CVS
internal variables are:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>CVSROOT</CODE>
<DD>
This is the value of the CVS root in use.
See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC15">The Repository</A>, for a description of the various
ways to specify this.

<DT><CODE>RCSBIN</CODE>
<DD>
This is the value CVS is using for where to find
RCS binaries.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC89">Global options</A>, for a
description of how to specify this.

<DT><CODE>CVSEDITOR</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>VISUAL</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>EDITOR</CODE>
<DD>
These all expand to the same value, which is the editor
that CVS is using.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC89">Global options</A>, for how
to specify this.

<DT><CODE>USER</CODE>
<DD>
Username of the user running CVS (on the CVS
server machine).
</DL>

<P>
If you want to pass a value to the administrative files
which the user that is running CVS can specify,
use a user variable.  To expand a user variable, the
administrative file contains
<CODE>${=<VAR>variable</VAR>}</CODE>.  To set a user variable,
specify the global option <SAMP>`-s'</SAMP> to CVS, with
argument <CODE><VAR>variable</VAR>=<VAR>value</VAR></CODE>.  It may be
particularly useful to specify this option via
<TT>`.cvsrc'</TT> (see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC88">Default options and the ~/.cvsrc file</A>).

</P>
<P>
For example, if you want the administrative file to
refer to a test directory you might create a user
variable <CODE>TESTDIR</CODE>.  Then if CVS is invoked
as <CODE>cvs -s TESTDIR=/work/local/tests</CODE>, and the
administrative file contains <CODE>sh
${=TESTDIR}/runtests</CODE>, then that string is expanded
to <CODE>sh /work/local/tests/runtests</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
All other strings containing <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> are reserved;
there is no way to quote a <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> character so that
<SAMP>`$'</SAMP> represents itself.

<A NAME="IDX412"></A>
<DT><CODE>$CVSROOT</CODE>
<DD>
Should contain the full pathname to the root of the CVS
source repository (where the RCS history files are
kept).  This information must be available to CVS for
most commands to execute; if <CODE>$CVSROOT</CODE> is not set,
or if you wish to override it for one invocation, you
can supply it on the command line: <SAMP>`cvs -d cvsroot
cvs_command...'</SAMP> Once you have checked out a working

CVS 1.3, but the next release will probably
include it.

<A NAME="IDX415"></A>
<DT><CODE>$PATH</CODE>

when <CODE>:ext:</CODE> access method is specified.
see section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC25">Connecting with rsh</A>.

<DT><CODE>$CVS_SERVER</CODE>
<DD>
Used in client-server mode when accessing a remote

<A NAME="IDX420"></A>
<DT><CODE>$CVS_RCMD_PORT</CODE>
<DD>
Used in client-server mode.  If set, specifies the port
number to be used when accessing the RCMD demon on
the server side. (Currently not used for Unix clients).

<A NAME="IDX421"></A>
<DT><CODE>$CVS_CLIENT_LOG</CODE>
<DD>
Used for debugging only in client-server
mode.  If set, everything send to the server is logged
into <TT>`<CODE>$CVS_CLIENT_LOG</CODE>.in'</TT> and everything
send from the server is logged into
<TT>`<CODE>$CVS_CLIENT_LOG</CODE>.out'</TT>.

<A NAME="IDX422"></A>
<DT><CODE>$CVS_SERVER_SLEEP</CODE>
<DD>
Used only for debugging the server side in
client-server mode.  If set, delays the start of the
server child process the the specified amount of
seconds so that you can attach to it with a debugger.

<A NAME="IDX423"></A>
<DT><CODE>$CVS_IGNORE_REMOTE_ROOT</CODE>
<DD>
(What is the purpose of this variable?)

<A NAME="IDX424"></A>
<DT><CODE>$COMSPEC</CODE>
<DD>
Used under OS/2 only.  It specifies the name of the
command interpreter and defaults to CMD.EXE.

<A NAME="IDX425"></A>
<DT><CODE>$TMPDIR</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX426"></A>
<DT><CODE>$TMP</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX427"></A>
<DT><CODE>$TEMP</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX428"></A>
Directory in which temporary files are located.  Those
parts of CVS which are implemented using RCS
inspect the above variables in the order they appear
above and the first value found is taken; if none of
them are set, a host-dependent default is used,
typically <TT>`/tmp'</TT>.  The CVS server uses
<CODE>TMPDIR</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC89">Global options</A>, for a
description of how to specify this.
Some parts of CVS will always use <TT>`/tmp'</TT> (via
the <CODE>tmpnam</CODE> function provided by the system).

On Windows NT, <CODE>TMP</CODE> is used (via the <CODE>_tempnam</CODE>
function provided by the system).

The <CODE>patch</CODE> program which is used by the CVS
client uses <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE>, and if it is not set, uses
<TT>`/tmp'</TT> (at least with GNU patch 2.1).
</DL>

<P>
CVS invokes RCS to perform certain
operations.  The following environment
variables affect RCS.  Note that if you are using
the client/server CVS, these variables need to be
set on the server side (which may or not may be
possible depending on how you are connecting).  There
is probably not any need to set any of them, however.

<H2><A NAME="SEC153" HREF="cvs-1.9_toc.html#TOC153">Magic branch numbers</A></H2>

<P>
Externally, branch numbers consist of an odd number of
dot-separated decimal integers.  See section <A HREF="cvs-1.9.html#SEC8">Revision numbers</A>.  That is not the whole truth, however.  For
efficiency reasons CVS sometimes inserts an extra 0
in the second rightmost position (1.2.3 becomes
1.2.0.3, 8.9.10.11.12 becomes 8.9.10.11.0.12 and so
on).

</P>
<P>
CVS does a pretty good job at hiding these so
called magic branches, but in a few places the hiding
is incomplete:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The magic branch number appears in the output from
<CODE>cvs log</CODE>.

<LI>

You cannot specify a symbolic branch name to <CODE>cvs
admin</CODE>.

</UL>

<P>
You can use the <CODE>admin</CODE> command to reassign a
symbolic name to a branch the way RCS expects it
to be.  If <CODE>R4patches</CODE> is assigned to the branch
1.4.2 (magic branch number 1.4.0.2) in file
<TT>`numbers.c'</TT> you can do this:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs admin -NR4patches:1.4.2 numbers.c
</PRE>

<P>
It only works if at least one revision is already
committed on the branch.  Be very careful so that you
do not assign the tag to the wrong number.  (There is
no way to see how the tag was assigned yesterday).

</P>
