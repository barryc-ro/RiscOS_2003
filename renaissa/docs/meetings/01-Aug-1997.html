Below are a summary of the meeting this lunchtime concerning source
control and cvs. I have booked hollywood for 10am next Friday (8th) for
a similiar meeting with a wider audience.

The following branches currently exist within cvs :
 Daytona - Netfax
 Ursula - RiscPC2
 Spinner - All NC work
 Web - Browser

The Daytona and Ursula branch do not seem to be in active use at the
moment. The Web branch is soon to be merged onto the trunk and at that
point will become inactive. Investigation is needed to find out what
state these branches are in and what development has been done external
to cvs. Action RB to investigate.

Concern was expressed as to the user-unfrendlyness of cvs. As RISC OS
cvs does not seem quite good enough at the moment and a RISC OS based
application to give a !SrcFiler type interface is a long way off (if
ever). The usability of cvs will be addressed by having a set of usable,
well documented scripts to facilitate the standard operations. These
will be written in perl and are therefore reasonably portable. This
would include checkins, checkin of new version, extraction of old
versions, auto merging of branches, auto notification, access control,
log digests, tagging, etc. Actions RB & NT to create work packages for
these, SC to get us the time.

A solution to the problem of having a checked out copy of source on NFS
and under RISC OS was discussed. Running an NFS daemon on RISC OS might
be a solution to this. Action KB to investigate.

The use of branches is getting over complicated. It is planned that all
future developments will be carried out on the trunk with a project
being taken onto a branch during its freeze phase. During this phase,
tight control is needed of any changes that may be applied to the
sources.

Version numbering was discussed at length. It was agreed that the
traditional RISC OS version numbering system of x.xx would be maintained
and incremented as changes are made along the trunk. Subsequent changes
along a branch would change a minor number either by incrementing it or
basing it on the RCS version number. This number would be publicised in
the help string of the module, following the date string. It was decided
that every module will have a file in its directory called VersionNum.
This would be either a C include file or GET'able assembler file that is
maintained by cvs scripts. The number, date, etc contained within this
file would be auto-updated whenever a "checkin and increment version"
takes place. Actions RB & NT to specify.

Log digests would be useful that summarise all the changes applied to a
given module, along with the RISC OS version number in a user-readable
form. This might be auto-generated whenever a checkout is peroformed and
updated on update or commit. Actions RB & NT to specify.

The current documentation on cvs is rather out of date. This is to be
updated for existing tools and scripts and extended to cover new tools
and scripts.

On the subject of the actual build process, we had agreement on the
proposals for having a module name, path and type database file that is
central to all builds. The components file then becomes a list of module
name and some "extra" options to pass to that particular modules
makefile. Also to be modified would be the awk scripts that generate the
makefiles. Actions RB & NT to specify.
