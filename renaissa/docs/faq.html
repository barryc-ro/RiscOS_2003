<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This document is the Acorn cvs FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions). It is intended
that it will be regularly updated as users questions are answered. This will 
become increasingly important as new staff start and/or people migrate from 
using !SrcFiler to cvs.

<h2>The Answers</h2>

<h3>UNIX cvs answers</h3>
<ol start=1>
<li><b><a name="uq1">What is cvs ?</a></b>
<p>
cvs is a version control system. Using it you can record the history of you
sources files.
<hr>
<li><b><a name="uq2">Where are cvs files held ?</a></b>
<p>
cvs maintains its files inside a centralised <b>repository</b>. This is a
directory which is populated with a hierarchy of files and directories.
<hr>
<li><b><a name="uq3">Who can access cvs ?</a></b>
<p>
Anyone within the unix file permissions group 'renaissa' can check out and
view files within the cvs repository. Checking in of modified files is more
tightly controlled using an access list maintained by the cvs administrators.
This access list allows a user to be granted permission to alter files on a
particular cvs branch within a particular directory sub-structure.
<hr>
<li><b><a name="uq4">What is a branch ?</a></b>
<p>
A branch is a logical line of development typically used to isolate source
files. A branch would be used for example to prevent unwanted modifications
being applied to a set of source files during a freeze period. A branch will
have an ancester - ie where the branch was taken from. Once finished with, 
a branch can be merged with another branch to allow changes to propagate.
<hr>
<li><b><a name="uq5">What is the trunk ?</a></b>
<p>
The trunk is a special case of a branch, it is also the default branch in
some circumstances.
<hr>
<li><b><a name="uq6">I get the error 'cvs: command not found'</a></b>
<p>
The machine you are using either does not have cvs installed, or your path is
not set correctly to locate the cvs application. Normally you will be using
cvs on valhalla with <code>/usr/local/bin</code> on your path.
<hr>
<li><b><a name="uq7">I get the error 'cvs: Sorry, you don't have read/write access to the history file'</a></b>
<p>
You are not in the unix file permissions group 'renaissa'. Contact your cvs
administrator and get them to sort it out.
<hr>
<li><b><a name="uq8">Do I use full paths or not ?</a></b>
<p>
Some cvs commands require a full path to be specified, for example <code>cvs
checkout</code>. Other commands allow a command to be issued from within a 
source directory structure, for example <code>cvs update</code>. 
<p>
The reason for this is that once you have a checked out copy of your sources,
there is a directory <code>CVS</code> associated with each source file
directory. This CVS directory contains control files that identify what files
are checked out and at what versions and from where. Running a cvs command or
script in this directory will cause these control files to be read to work
out where we are and what is going on. Of course if you have not got any 
checked out files, you need to be in the root of your build tree and use a
full path name. This is typical for checkouts for example <code> cvs checkout
RiscOS/Sources/Kernel</code>.
<hr> 
<li><b><a name="uq9">Do I need to checkout files again following a commit ?</a></b>
<p>
No. Following a successful commit, your working directory will contain the
same version as the repository (for a given branch and for each file that was
committed). You can continue to edit these files and re-commit them in the
future when it is appropriate.
<hr> 
<li><b><a name="uq10">When does cvs automatically merge files ?</a></b>
<p>
Since cvs allows concurrent development of the same file by different people,
cvs needs to resolve these independant changes at the time of commit. 
<p>
Consider the case where two people change the same file in different places.
The first person comes to commit their file into the repository, the version
of their previously checked out copy (what they based there changes on) is
the same as  the repository so they can just do a normal commit. When the
second person comes to do a commit, their previously checked out copy is
different to the current version in the repository therefore a merge needs to
take place to incorporate the first persons changes into the second persons
file. cvs reports this as <code><b>csv commit: Up-to-date check failed for 
'&lt;file&gt;'</b></code>. At this point the second user should perform the
command <code><b>cvs update</b></code> to merge the files. If there are any
conficts caused by this merge, the commit will fail and the second person
will be prompted to resolve the conflicts (they are marked quite clearly in
the file) before attempting another commit.
<p>
Note: cvs does the "right thing" when merging. If it is at all unsure, the user
is prompted tp resolve the conflicts.
<hr> 
<li><b><a name="uq11">What is that magic cvs -nq update ?</a></b>
<p>
The command <code>cvs -nq update</code> is a very useful command for seeing
what would happen if an update was to be performed. This will display 
information on file status as follows.
<p>
<center>
<table border=1>
<tr><th>Abreviation<th>Meaning
<tr><td align="center">A<td>File has been added using <code>cvs add</code> 
	but not committed.
<tr><td align="center">R<td>File has been removed using <code>cvs remove</code> 
	but not committed.

</table>
</center>
<hr> 
<li><b><a name="uq12">What unix environment do I need to run cvs ?</a></b>
<p>
cvs is a unix command line tool installed on valhalla. To access this you
need an interactive login on valhalla and a reasonable amount of free space
on your home mount (enough for any checked out files). The following unix
environment variables require setting. This should ideally be done as part of
your startup scripts such as .cshrc or .bashrc.
<p>
For csh users :
<blockquote>
<pre>
<b> setenv EDITOR vi </b> or other if preferred
<b> setenv CVSROOT /projects2/renaissa/cvsroot </b>
<b> set path = ( $path /projects2/renaissa/bin ) </b>
<b> umask 2 </b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
For bash users - warning bash is not csg approved (but is very cool), use at
your own risk :
<blockquote>
<pre>
<b> export EDITOR=vi </b>
<b> export CVSROOT=/projects2/renaissa/cvsroot </b>
<b> export PATH=$PATH:/projects2/renaissa/bin </b>
<b> umask 2 </b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The binary for cvs can be found in <b>/usr/local/bin</b> on valhalla, you
should ensure you have this directory on your search path. 
Many scripts have been written to assist users with cvs. These can be found in
the directory <code><b>/projects2/renaissa/bin</b></code> which needs to be on
your search path. This is done in the above script examples.
<p>
If you are accessing valhalla though a telnet session on a RiscPC, !FreeTerm
is recommended in preference to !VT220 as normally supplied.
<hr>
<li><b><a name="uq13">What are those .cvstag files ?</a></b>
<p>
cvs does not like checking out of empty directories. Empty directories occur
quite often in the RISC OS build tree (rm and o directories for example). To
ensure these directories are checked out correctly, the script 
<code>cvsimport</code> detects emptyness and places a tag file 
<code>.cvstag</code> in the directory to preserve it.
<hr>
<li><b><a name="uq14">How can the repository be examined ?</a></b>
<p>
To find out what is in the repository, the command <code>cvsls</code>
is provided. It works much like the ls command, but examines the repository
instead of the current directory.  It is a little crude, but simple and
should be sufficient.  For example:
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>% cvsls RiscOS/Sources/Apps</b>
Boot            Help            NCFiler         NCWriter
NCConfig        NCFresco        
</pre>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<li><b><a name="uq15">How do I check out a module ?</a></b>
<p>
Files are checked out in order to make modifications to a module. Individual
files or whole directories can be checked out using the command <code>cvs
checkout</code> as described below.
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
        <b>cvs checkout -r Daytona [module name]</b>
example <b>cvs checkout -r Daytona RiscOS/Sources/Kernel</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Where [module name] is the full path to the module from the root of the
repository. The checked out version will be copied to the current working
directory with all directories in the hierarchy created (if not already
present). The checked out version will contain CVS control files along with
any <a href="#uq13">.cvstag</a>. These should not be deleted from the checked
out area as they are required by CVS when checking changes back into the
repository.
<p>
The "-r Daytona" option ensures that work is done on the CVS branch
labelled Daytona. This branch name will change with project and state of
development within that project. For example a branch may be used to control
the freeze of a project.

<hr>
<li><b><a name="uq16">How do I commit my changes ?</a></b>
<p>
Once files have been edited and are ready for committing back into the
repository, the following command should be issued.
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
        <b>cvs commit [filename] </b>
example <b>cvs commit Makefile </b>
or      <b>cvs commit</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If no filename is specified, all files in the current working directory are
committed into the repository (if they have changed). Firstly the file time
stamp is checked, if this has changed, a diff is performed between the checked
out copy of the file and the repository version of the file. Only if changes
have been performed, will the file be committed.

<hr>
<li><b><a name="uq17">How do add files to the repository ?</a></b>
<p>
If a file does not already exist in the respository it is not committed by
default. If a new source file has been added, this requires explicit addition
to the repository using the following command.
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
        <b>cvs add [filename] </b>
example <b>cvs add newsrc </b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
When performing this command, you should be in the directory containing the
file. If the file to be added is a binary, for example a sprite, the
following command should be used instead to change the way CVS stores the
file internally.
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
        <b>cvs add -kb [binary filename] </b>
example <b>cvs add -kb !Sprites </b>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<li><b><a name="uq18">How do remove files from the repository ?</a></b>
<p>
Occasionally you may need to remove source files from the repository. To do
this you remove the file from your checkout out sources and use the 
following command.
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
        <b>cvs rm [filename] </b>
example <b>cvs rm badsrc </b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note, the file is not actually removed from the repository, it is just put in
a safe place so you cannot see it when you do a checkout.
<hr>
<li><b><a name="uq19">cvs abbreviations</a></b>
<p>
Many cvs commands have abbreviations. The following table lists some of the
more common ones.
<center>
<table border=1 width="50%">
<tr><th>Abbreviation<th>Command
<tr><td align="center">co<td>checkout
<tr><td align="center">ci<td>commit
</table>
</center>
<hr>
<li><b><a name="uq20">Adding a new module</a></b>
<p>
A typical task for a cvs user would be to add a new module to the build tree.
This is demonstrated below by adding a new Networking module.
<p>
Firstly, checkout the directory structure required (the -l flag will only
checkout the directory, not the files below it). Then move into this
directory and create the new module directory.
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
        <b>cvs checkout -r Ursula -l RiscOS/Sources/Networking</b>
        <b>cd RiscOS/Sources/Networking</b>
        <b>mkdir NewModule</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now tell CVS that is this a new module to be added to the repository.
<blockquote>
<pre>
        <b>cvs add NewModule</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
Create all the new files requred by the module in this directory then
explicitly add them to the repository using the <b>cvs add</b> and <b>cvs add
-kb</b> commands described earlier. Finally commit all the new files.
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
        <b>cvs commit</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
Adding log entries as prompted.
<p>
<hr>
<li><b><a name="uq21">What is cvssync ?</a></b>
<p>
cvssync is a script that can be used to synchronise the repository and
checked out sources. This may involve adding/removing files. To use, prepare
the checked out sources to the correct state and issue the command :
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
        <b>cvssync</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
You will be prompted to add/remove files as the script works out what is going
to happen. Currently (as of 23 Oct 1997) you need to run this script a number
of times to ensure all directories are recursed correctly. Keep running the
command until no more questions are asked.
<p>
<hr>
<li><b><a name="uq22">How do I maintain RISC OS version numbers ?</a></b>
<p>
To maintain RISC OS version numbers, a cvs wrapper script 
<code>srccommit</code> should be used. This automatically maintains the version
number and date field across different branches of development. Consult the
<a href="./srccommit.html">srccommit instructions</a> for more info.
<hr>
<li><b><a name="uq23">I get the error 'You cannot commit the file 'foo' ... ... correct access list'</a></b>
<p>
cvs restricts access to particular branch/directory combinations for individual
users. These restrictions are maintained using the <b>Access control list</b>
which is also under cvs control. This control is in place to prevent acidental
breakages, expecially if a source branch is under strict freeze control.
<p>
If you get the above error, and you are sure you are trying to commit to the
correct branch, please ask <a href="mailto:rbuckley">Rich</a>, 
<a href="mailto:nturton">Neil</a> or <a href="mailto:kbracey">Kevin</a> for
assistance.

<h3>RISC OS cvs answers</h3>

Note that the definitive answers to these questions are in
<code>!CVS.!Help</code>. See <a href="riscoscvs.html">the RISC OS CVS
page</a>

<ol start=1>
<li><b><a name="rq1">What is RISC OS cvs ?</a></b>
<p>
RISC OS is a port of command line cvs program. The port is only of the 
client-side part of the CVS program, so will only work with a remote
repository on a server. This is sufficient for use with the main RISC OS
build tree, which is served by valhalla.

<hr>
<li><b><a name="rq2">RISC OS requirements ?</a></b>
<p>
<b>Internet module:</b> RISC OS cvs requires version (5.03) or greater of
the Internet module - there are some serious bugs in previous versions
which cause crashes when used from cvs. These problems only seem to
occur when running in a TaskWindow.

<p>
<b>OmniClient:</b> RISC OS CVS conflicts badly with OmniClient. No
solution is known, other than not running OmniClient at all (even
quitting OmniClient before using RISC OS CVS doesn't work).
<p>

<hr>
<li><b><a name="rq3">Problems with *Prefix</a></b>
<p>
CVS often changes the CSD. If one has used <code>*prefix</code>
previously in the same taskwindow however, then RISC OS will use the
current value of prefix in preference to the CSD. Thus CVS will fail if
prefix is set. In future, RISC OS CVS may use prefix for everything
rather than the CSD, but currently this causes problems.

<hr>
<li><b><a name="rq4">How is the home directory specified ?</a></b>
<p>
CVS stores mildy-encrypted passwords inside a directory specified by the
environmental value <code>&lt;HOME&gt;</code>. To make this a little
more RISC OS complient, RISC OS CVS uses
<code>&lt;CVS_Home$Dir&gt;</code> in preference if it is set. By
default, this is set to <code>&lt;Choices$Dir&gt;.RiscosCVS.Home</code>,
which is usually <code>$.!BOOT.Choices.RiscosCVS.Home</code>.


<hr>
<li><b><a name="rq5">How is the repository located ?</a></b>
<p>
To use CVS with the rennaisa repository on valhalla (which contains the
complete RISC OS source tree) you should set
<code>&lt;CVSROOT&gt;</code> to :

<blockquote>
<code>
:pserver:&lt;username&gt;@valhalla:/projects2/renaissa/cvsroot
</code>
</blockquote>
where <code>&lt;username&gt;</code> is your username.
