<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This document is the Acorn cvs FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions). It is intended
that it will be regularly updated as users questions are answered. This will 
become increasingly important as new staff start and/or people migrate from 
using !SrcFiler to cvs.
<p>
Please refer to this document for any support queries before hasseling the

<h2>The Answers</h2>

<h3>UNIX cvs answers</h3>
<ol start=1>
<li><b><a name="uq1">What is cvs ?</a></b>
<p>
cvs is a version control system. Using it you can record the history of you
sources files.
<hr>
<li><b><a name="uq2">Where are cvs files held ?</a></b>
<p>
cvs maintains its files inside a centralised <b>repository</b>. This is a
directory which is populated with a hierarchy of files and directories.
<hr>
<li><b><a name="uq3">Who can access cvs ?</a></b>
<p>
Anyone within the unix file permissions group 'renaissa' can check out and
view files within the cvs repository. Checking in of modified files is more
tightly controlled using an access list maintained by the cvs administrators.
This access list allows a user to be granted permission to alter files on a
particular cvs branch within a particular directory sub-structure.
<hr>
<li><b><a name="uq4">What is a branch ?</a></b>
<p>
A branch is a logical line of development typically used to isolate source
files. A branch would be used for example to prevent unwanted modifications
being applied to a set of source files during a freeze period. A branch will
have an ancester - ie where the branch was taken from. Once finished with, 
a branch can be merged with another branch to allow changes to propagate.
<hr>
<li><b><a name="uq5">What is the trunk ?</a></b>
<p>
The trunk is a special case of a branch, it is also the default branch in
some circumstances.
<hr>
<li><b><a name="uq6">I get the error 'cvs: command not found'</a></b>
<p>
The machine you are using either does not have cvs installed, or your path is
not set correctly to locate the cvs application. Normally you will be using
cvs on valhalla with <code>/usr/local/bin</code> on your path.
<hr>
<li><b><a name="uq7">I get the error 'cvs: Sorry, you don't have read/write access to the history file'</a></b>
<p>
You are not in the unix file permissions group 'renaissa'. Contact your cvs
administrator and get them to sort it out.

<h3>RISC OS cvs answers</h3>
<ol start=1>
<li><b><a name="rq1">What is RISC OS cvs ?</a></b>
<p>
RISC OS is a port of command line cvs. The port is only of the client-side
part of the CVS program, so will only work with a remote repository on a
server. This is sufficient for use with the main RISC OS build tree,
which is served by valhalla.
<hr>
<li><b><a name="rq2">RISC OS requirements ?</a></b>
<p>
<b>Internet module</b> RISC OS cvs requires version (X.XX) or greater
of the Internet module - there are some serious bugs in previous versions
which cause crashes when used from cvs. These problems only seem to occur
when running in a TaskWindow.
<p>
<b>Wimpslot</b>RISC OS cvs uses the UnixLib runtime system rather than that
of the Shared C Library. This means that it cannot extend its wimpslot, and
also seems to cause nasty crashes when it runs out of memory. Enough testing 
has not been done to ascertain the minimum amount of memory required, try a 
2Mb wimpslot.
<hr>
<li><b><a name="rq3">How is Prefix used ?</a></b>
<p>
CVS often changes the CSD. If one has used '*prefix' however, then RISC
OS will use the current value of prefix in preference to the CSD. Thus
CVS will fail if prefix is set. In future, RISC OS CVS may use prefix
for everything rather than the CSD, but currently this causes problems.
<hr>
<li><b><a name="rq4">How is the home directory specified ?</a></b>
<p>
CVS stores mildy-encrypted passwords inside a directory specified by the
environmental value 'HOME'. To make this a little more RISC OS
complient, RISC OS CVS uses &lt;CVS_Home$Dir&gt; in preference if it is set.
<hr>
<li><b><a name="rq5">How is the repository located ?</a></b>
<p>
To use CVS with the rennaisa repository on valhalla (which contains the
complete RISC OS source tree) you should set &lt;CVSROOT&gt; to :
<blockquote>
<code>
:pserver:&lt;username&gt;&amp;&amp;valhalla:/projects2/renaissa/cvsroot
</code>
</blockquote>
where '&lt;username&gt;' is your username.
