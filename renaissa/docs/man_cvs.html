CVS(1)                    User Commands                    CVS(1)

<H3>NAME</H3>
     cvs - Concurrent Versions System

<H3>SYNOPSIS</H3>
     cvs [ <i>cvs</i>_<i>options</i> ]
          <i>cvs</i>_<i>command</i> [ <i>command</i>_<i>options</i> ] [ <i>command</i>_<i>args</i> ]

<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
     cvs is a front end to the  <a href="http://dylan/cgi-bin/man-cgi?rcs+1">rcs(1)</a>  revision  control  system
     which  extends the notion of revision control from a collec-
     tion of files in a single directory to a  hierarchical  col-
     lection  of  directories  consisting  of revision controlled
     files.  These directories and files can be combined together
     to  form  a  software  release.   cvs provides the functions
     necessary to manage these software releases and  to  control
     the  concurrent  editing  of  source  files  among  multiple
     software developers.

     cvs keeps a single copy of the master sources.  This copy is
     called the source ``repository''; it contains all the infor-
     mation to permit extracting previous  software  releases  at
     any  time based on either a symbolic revision tag, or a date
     in the past.

<H3>ESSENTIAL COMMANDS</H3>
     cvs provides a rich variety of commands (<i>cvs</i>_<i>command</i> in  the
     Synopsis),  each  of which often has a wealth of options, to
     satisfy the many needs of source management  in  distributed
     environments.   However,  you  don't  have  to  master every
     detail to do useful work with cvs; in  fact,  five  commands
     are sufficient to use (and contribute to) the source reposi-
     tory.

     cvs checkout <i>modules</i>...
          A necessary preliminary for most cvs work: creates your
          private  copy  of the source for <i>modules</i> (named collec-
          tions of source; you can also use a  path  relative  to
          the  source  repository  here).  You can work with this
          copy without interfering with others' work.   At  least
          one subdirectory level is always created.

     cvs update
          Execute this command from <i>within</i>  your  private  source
          directory when you wish to update your copies of source
          files from changes that other developers have  made  to
          the source in the repository.

     cvs add <i>file</i>...
          Use this command to enroll new files in cvs records  of
          your working directory.  The files will be added to the
          repository the next time you run `cvs  commit'.   Note:
          You  should  use  the `cvs import' command to bootstrap

CVS(1)                    User Commands                    CVS(1)

          new sources into the source repository.  `cvs  add'  is
          only  used  for  new  files  to  an already checked-out
          module.

     cvs remove <i>file</i>...
          Use this command (after erasing any  files  listed)  to
          declare that you wish to eliminate files from the repo-
          sitory.  The removal does not affect others  until  you
          run `cvs commit'.

     cvs commit <i>file</i>...
          Use this command when  you  wish  to  ``publish''  your
          changes  to  other developers, by incorporating them in
          the source repository.

<H3>OPTIONS</H3>
     The cvs command line can include <i>cvs</i>_<i>options</i>, which apply to
     the  overall  cvs  program; a <i>cvs</i>_<i>command</i>, which specifies a
     particular   action   on   the   source   repository;    and
     <i>command</i>_<i>options</i>  and <i>command</i>_<i>arguments</i> to fully specify what
     the <i>cvs</i>_<i>command</i> will do.

     <i>Warning</i>: you must be careful of precisely  where  you  place
     options  relative  to  the <i>cvs</i>_<i>command</i>.  The same option can
     mean different things depending on  whether  it  is  in  the
     <i>cvs</i>_<i>options</i>  position  (to  the left of a cvs command) or in
     the <i>command</i>_<i>options</i> position (to the right  of  a  cvs  com-
     mand).

     There  are  only  two  situations   where   you   may   omit
     <i>cvs</i>_<i>command</i>:   `cvs  - H'  or `cvs --help' elicits a list of
     available commands, and `cvs -v' or `cvs --version' displays
     version information on cvs itself.

<H3>CVS OPTIONS</H3>
     As of release 1.6, cvs supports GNU style  long  options  as
     well  as  short  options.   Only  a  few  long  options  are
     currently supported, these are listed in brackets after  the
     short options whose functions they duplicate.

     Use these options to control the overall cvs program:

     -H [ --help ]
          Display   usage   information   about   the   specified
          <i>cvs</i>_<i>command</i>  (but do not actually execute the command).
          If you don't specify a command name, `cvs -H'  displays
          a summary of all the commands available.

     -Q    Causes the command to be  <i>really</i>  quiet;  the  command
          will generate output only for serious problems.

CVS(1)                    User Commands                    CVS(1)

     -q    Causes the command to be somewhat quiet; informational
          messages,  such  as  reports  of recursion through sub-
          directories, are suppressed.

     -b <i>bindir</i>
          Use <i>bindir</i> as the  directory  where  RCS  programs  are
          located.   Overrides the setting of the RCSBIN environ-
          ment variable.  This value should be  specified  as  an
          absolute pathname.

     -d <i>CVS</i>_<i>root</i>_<i>directory</i>
          Use <i>CVS</i>_<i>root</i>_<i>directory</i> as the root  directory  pathname
          of  the  master  RCS  source repository.  Overrides the
          setting of  the  CVSROOT  environment  variable.   This
          value should be specified as an absolute pathname.

     -e <i>editor</i>
          Use <i>editor</i> to enter revision  log  information.   Over-
          rides  the  setting  of  the  CVSEDITOR  and the EDITOR
          environment variables.

     -f    Do not read the cvs startup file (~/.<i>cvsrc</i>).

     -l    Do not log the <i>cvs</i>_<i>command</i> in the command history (but
          execute it anyway).  See the description of the history
          command for information on command history.

     -n    Do not change  any  files.   Attempt  to  execute  the
          <i>cvs</i>_<i>command</i>,  but only to issue reports; do not remove,
          update, or merge any existing files, or create any  new
          files.

     -t    Trace program execution; display messages showing  the
          steps  of cvs activity.  Particularly useful with -n to
          explore the potential impact of an unfamiliar command.

     -r    Makes new working files read-only.  Same effect as  if
          the CVSREAD environment variable is set.

     -v [ --version ]
          Displays version and copyright information for cvs.

     -w    Makes new working files read-write  (default).   Over-
          rides the setting of the CVSREAD environment variable.

     -z <i>compression</i>-<i>level</i>
          When transferring files across  the  network  use  gzip
          with  compression  level  <i>compression</i>-<i>level</i> to compress
          and de-compress data as it  is  transferred.   Requires
          the  presence  of  the  GNU gzip program in the current
          search path at both ends of the link.

CVS(1)                    User Commands                    CVS(1)

<H3>USAGE</H3>
     Except when requesting general help with `cvs -H', you  must
     specify  a  <i>cvs</i>_<i>command</i>  to cvs to select a specific release
     control function to perform.  Each cvs command  accepts  its
     own  collection  of  options  and  arguments.  However, many
     options are available  across  several  commands.   You  can
     display a usage summary for each command by specifying the -
     H option with the command.

<H3>CVS STARTUP FILE</H3>
     Normally, when CVS starts up, it reads the .<i>cvsrc</i> file  from
     the  home  directory  of  the user reading it.  This startup
     procedure can be turned off with the -f flag.

     The .<i>cvsrc</i> file lists CVS commands with a list of arguments,
     one  command  per  line.  For example, the following line in
     .<i>cvsrc</i>:

     diff -c

     will mean that the `cvs diff' command will always be  passed
     the  - c  option  in  addition to any other options that are
     specified in the command line (in this case it will have the
     effect  of  producing context sensitive diffs for all execu-
     tions of `cvs diff' ).

<H3>CVS COMMAND SUMMARY</H3>
     Here are brief descriptions of all the cvs commands:

     add  Add a new file or directory to the repository,  pending
          a `cvs commit' on the same file.  Can only be done from
          within sources created by  a  previous  `cvs  checkout'
          invocation.   Use  `cvs  import'  to  place  whole  new
          hierarchies of sources under cvs  control.   (Does  not
          directly affect repository; changes working directory.)

     admin
          Execute RCS control functions on the source repository.
          (Changes  repository  directly;  uses working directory
          without changing it.)

     checkout
          Make a working directory of source files  for  editing.
          (Creates or changes working directory.)

     commit
          Apply to the source repository changes, additions,  and
          deletions  from your working directory.  (Changes repo-
          sitory.)

     diff Show differences between files in working directory and
          source  repository,  or between two revisions in source

          repository.  (Does  not  change  either  repository  or
          working directory.)

     export
          Prepare copies of a set of source  files  for  shipment
          off  site.   Differs from `cvs checkout' in that no cvs
          administrative directories are created  (and  therefore
          `cvs  commit'  cannot  be  executed  from  a  directory
          prepared with `cvs export'), and a symbolic tag must be
          specified.  (Does not change repository; creates direc-
          tory similar to working directories).

     history
          Show reports on cvs commands that you  or  others  have
          executed  on  a  particular  file  or  directory in the
          source repository.   (Does  not  change  repository  or
          working  directory.)   History  logs  are  kept only if
          enabled by creation of  the  `$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/history'
          file; see <a href="http://dylan/cgi-bin/man-cgi?cvs+5">cvs(5)</a>.

     import
          Incorporate a set of updates  from  off-site  into  the
          source  repository,  as  a ``vendor branch''.  (Changes
          repository.)

     log  Display RCS log information.  (Does not change  reposi-
          tory or working directory.)

     rdiff
          Prepare a collection of diffs as a patch  file  between
          two releases in the repository.  (Does not change repo-
          sitory or working directory.)

     release
          Cancel a `cvs checkout', abandoning any changes.   (Can
          delete working directory; no effect on repository.)

     remove
          Remove files from the source repository, pending a `cvs
          commit'  on  the same files.  (Does not directly affect
          repository; changes working directory.)

     rtag Explicitly specify a symbolic tag for particular  revi-
          sions of files in the source repository.  See also `cvs
          tag'.  (Changes repository directly; does  not  require
          or affect working directory.)

     status
          Show current status of files: latest  version,  version
          in  working directory, whether working version has been
          edited and, optionally, symbolic tags in the RCS  file.
          (Does not change repository or working directory.)

CVS(1)                    User Commands                    CVS(1)

     tag  Specify a symbolic tag for files in the repository.  By
          default, tags the revisions that were last synchronized
          with  your  working  directory.    (Changes  repository
          directly; uses working directory without changing it.)

     update
          Bring your working directory up to  date  with  changes
          from  the  repository.   Merges are performed automati-
          cally when possible; a  warning  is  issued  if  manual
          resolution   is   required   for  conflicting  changes.
          (Changes working directory;  does  not  change  reposi-
          tory.)

<H3>COMMON COMMAND OPTIONS</H3>
     This section describes the <i>command</i>_<i>options</i> that  are  avail-
     able  across several cvs commands.  Not all commands support
     all of these options; each option is only supported for com-
     mands where it makes sense.  However, when a command has one
     of these options you can count on the same meaning  for  the
     option  as in other commands.  (Other command options, which
     are listed with the individual commands, may have  different
     meanings  from  one  cvs  command to another.)  <i>Warning</i>: the
     history command is an exception; it  supports  many  options
     that conflict even with these standard options.

     -D <i>date</i>_<i>spec</i>
          Use the most recent revision no later than <i>date</i>_<i>spec</i> (a
          single  argument, date description specifying a date in
          the past).  A wide variety of  date  formats  are  sup-
          ported  by  the  underlying  RCS facilities, similar to
          those described in <a href="http://dylan/cgi-bin/man-cgi?co+1">co(1)</a>, but  not  exactly  the  same.
          The  <i>date</i>_<i>spec</i>  is  interpreted  as  being in the local
          timezone, unless a specific timezone is specified.  The
          specification  is  ``sticky'' when you use it to make a
          private copy of a source file; that is, when you get  a
          working  file using -D, cvs records the date you speci-
          fied, so that further updates  in  the  same  directory
          will  use the same date (unless you explicitly override
          it; see the description of the update command).  -D  is
          available  with  the  checkout,  diff,  history, rdiff,
          rtag, and update  commands.   Examples  of  valid  date
          specifications include:
                    1 month ago
                    2 hours ago
                    400000 seconds ago
                    last year
                    last Monday
                    yesterday
                    a fortnight ago
                    3/31/92 10:00:07 PST

CVS(1)                    User Commands                    CVS(1)

     -f    When you specify a particular date or tag to cvs  com-
          mands,  they  normally ignore files that do not contain
          the tag (or did not exist on the date) that you  speci-
          fied.   Use  the  -f option if you want files retrieved
          even when there is no match for the tag or date.   (The
          most  recent version is used in this situation.)  -f is
          available  with  these  commands:   checkout,   export,
          rdiff, rtag, and update.

     -H    Help; describe the options available for this command.
          This is the only option supported for <i>all</i> cvs commands.

     -k <i>kflag</i>
          Alter the default RCS processing of keywords; all the -
          k  options  described  in  <a href="http://dylan/cgi-bin/man-cgi?co+1">co(1)</a> are available.  The -k
          option is  available  with  the  add,  checkout,  diff,
          rdiff,  and  update commands.  Your <i>kflag</i> specification
          is ``sticky'' when you use it to create a private  copy
          of  a  source  file;  that is, when you use this option
          with the checkout or update  commands,  cvs  associates
          your selected <i>kflag</i> with the file, and continues to use
          it with future update commands on the same  file  until
          you specify otherwise.

          Some of the more useful <i>kflag</i>s are -ko  and  - kb  (for
          binary  files,  only compatible with RCS version 5.7 or
          later), and -kv which is useful for an export where you
          wish  to  retain keyword information after an import at
          some other site.

     -l    Local; run only in current working  directory,  rather
          than recurring through subdirectories.   Available with
          the  following  commands:   checkout,   commit,   diff,
          export,  remove, rdiff, status, tag, and update.  <i>Warn-</i>
          <i>ing</i>: this is not the same  as  the  overall  `cvs  - l'
          option, which you can specify to the <i>left</i> of a cvs com-
          mand!

     -n    Do <i>not</i> run any checkout/commit/tag/ program.  (A  pro-
          gram  can  be specified to run on each of these activi-
          ties, in the modules  database;  this  option  bypasses
          it.)   Available with the checkout, commit, export, and
          rtag commands.  <i>Warning</i>: this is not the  same  as  the
          overall  `cvs  -n' option, which you can specify to the
          <i>left</i> of a cvs command!

     -P    Prune (remove) directories that are empty after  being
          updated,  on  checkout,  or update.  Normally, an empty
          directory (one  that  is  void  of  revision-controlled
          files)  is  left alone.  Specifying -P will cause these
          directories to be silently removed from  your  checked-
          out  sources.   This does not remove the directory from

          the repository, only from your checked out copy.   Note
          that  this option is implied by the -r or -D options of
          checkout and export.

     -p    Pipe the files retrieved from the repository to  stan-
          dard  output,  rather  than writing them in the current
          directory.  Available with the checkout and update com-
          mands.

     -r <i>tag</i>
          Use the revision specified by the <i>tag</i> argument  instead
          of the default ``head'' revision.  As well as arbitrary
          tags defined with the tag or rtag command, two  special
          tags  are  always available:  `HEAD' refers to the most
          recent version available in the repository, and  `BASE'
          refers  to  the  revision you last checked out into the
          current working directory.

          The <i>tag</i> specification is ``sticky'' when you  use  this
          option with `cvs checkout' or `cvs update' to make your
          own copy of a file: cvs remembers the <i>tag</i> and continues
          to  use it on future update commands, until you specify
          otherwise.  <i>tag</i> can be either  a  symbolic  or  numeric
          tag,  in  RCS fashion.  Specifying the -q global option
          along with the -r command option is  often  useful,  to
          suppress  the  warning  messages when the RCS file does
          not contain the specified tag.  -r  is  available  with
          the  checkout,  commit,  diff,  history, export, rdiff,
          rtag, and update commands.  <i>Warning</i>: this  is  not  the
          same  as  the  overall  `cvs  -r' option, which you can

<H3>CVS COMMANDS</H3>
     Here (finally) are details on all the cvs commands  and  the
     options  each accepts.  The summary lines at the top of each
     command's description highlight three kinds of things:

         Command Options and Arguments
               Special options are  described  in  detail  below;
               common command options may appear only in the sum-
               mary line.

         Working Directory, or Repository?
               Some cvs commands require a working  directory  to
               operate;  some  require  a repository.  Also, some
               commands <i>change</i> the repository,  some  change  the
               working directory, and some change nothing.

         Synonyms
               Many commands have synonyms, which  you  may  find
               easier  to  remember  (or type) than the principal
               name.

     add [-k <i>kflag</i>] [-m '<i>message</i>'] <i>files</i>...
          <i>Requires</i>: repository, working directory.
          <i>Changes</i>: working directory.
          <i>Synonym</i>: new
          Use the add command to create a new file  or  directory
          in the RCS source repository.  The files or directories
          specified with add must already exist  in  the  current
          directory  (which  must  have  been  created  with  the
          checkout  command).   To  add  a  whole  new  directory
          hierarchy  to the source repository (for example, files
          received from  a  third-party  vendor),  use  the  `cvs
          import' command instead.

          If the argument to `cvs add'  refers  to  an  immediate
          sub-directory,  the directory is created at the correct
          place in the RCS source repository, and  the  necessary
          cvs  administration  files  are created in your working
          directory.  If the  directory  already  exists  in  the
          source repository, `cvs add' still creates the adminis-
          tration files in your version of the  directory.   This
          allows  you to use `cvs add' to add a particular direc-
          tory to your  private  sources  even  if  someone  else
          created  that  directory  after  your  checkout  of the
          sources.  You can do the following:

                    example% mkdir new_directory
                    example% cvs add new_directory
                    example% cvs update new_directory

          An alternate approach using `cvs update' might be:

                    example% cvs update -d new_directory

          (To add <i>any</i> <i>available</i> new directories to  your  working
          directory,  it's probably simpler to use `cvs checkout'
          or `cvs update -d'.)

          The added files are not placed in the RCS source  repo-
          sitory  until  you  use `cvs commit' to make the change
          permanent.  Doing a  `cvs  add'  on  a  file  that  was
          removed  with  the  `cvs remove' command will resurrect
          the file, if no `cvs commit' command intervened.

          You will have the opportunity to specify a logging mes-
          sage,  as  usual, when you use `cvs commit' to make the
          new file permanent.  If you'd like to have another log-
          ging  message associated with just <i>creation</i> of the file
          (for example, to describe the file's purpose), you  can
          specify it with the `-m <i>message</i>' option to the add com-
          mand.

          The `-k kflag' option specifies the  default  way  that

          this file will be checked out.  The `kflag' argument is
          stored in the RCS file and can  be  changed  with  `cvs
          admin'.   Specifying  `-ko'  is  useful for checking in
          binaries  that  shouldn't  have  the  RCS  id   strings
          expanded.

     admin [<i>rcs</i>-<i>options</i>] <i>files</i>...
          <i>Requires</i>: repository, working directory.
          <i>Changes</i>: repository.
          <i>Synonym</i>: rcs
          This is the cvs interface  to  assorted  administrative
          RCS facilities, documented in <a href="http://dylan/cgi-bin/man-cgi?rcs+1">rcs(1)</a>.  `cvs admin' sim-
          ply passes all its options and  arguments  to  the  rcs
          command;  it  does  no  filtering  or other processing.
          This command does work recursively, however, so extreme
          care should be used.

     checkout [options] <i>modules</i>...
          <i>Requires</i>: repository.
          <i>Changes</i>: working directory.
          <i>Synonyms</i>: co, get
          Make a  working  directory  containing  copies  of  the
          source  files  specified  by <i>modules</i>.  You must execute
          `cvs checkout' before using most of the other cvs  com-
          mands,  since  most  of  them  operate  on your working
          directory.

          <i>modules</i> are either symbolic names  (themselves  defined
          as  the  module `modules' in the source repository; see
          <a href="http://dylan/cgi-bin/man-cgi?cvs+5">cvs(5)</a>) for some collection of source  directories  and
          files,  or paths to directories or files in the reposi-
          tory.

          Depending on the  <i>modules</i>  you  specify,  checkout  may
          recursively  create  directories and populate them with
          the appropriate source files.  You can then edit  these
          source  files  at any time (regardless of whether other
          software developers are editing their own copies of the
          sources); update them to include new changes applied by
          others to the source repository; or commit your work as
          a permanent change to the RCS repository.

          Note that checkout is used to create directories.   The
          top-level  directory  created  is  always  added to the
          directory where checkout is invoked,  and  usually  has
          the  same name as the specified <i>module</i>.  In the case of
          a <i>module</i> alias, the created sub-directory  may  have  a
          different  name,  but you can be sure that it will be a
          sub-directory, and that checkout will show the relative
          path  leading to each file as it is extracted into your
          private work area (unless you specify the   - Q  global
          option).

CVS(1)                    User Commands                    CVS(1)

          Running `cvs checkout' on a directory that was  already
          built  by  a  prior checkout is also permitted, and has
          the same effect as specifying the  - d  option  to  the
          update command described below.

          The <i>options</i> permitted with `cvs checkout'  include  the
          standard command options -P, -f, -k <i>kflag</i> , -l, -n, -p,
          -r <i>tag</i>, and -D <i>date</i>.

          In addition to those, you can use these special command
          options with checkout:

          Use the -A option to reset any sticky tags, dates, or -
          k options.  (If you get a working file using one of the
          -r, -D, or -k options, cvs remembers the  corresponding
          tag,  date,  or  <i>kflag</i> and continues using it on future
          updates; use the -A option to  make  cvs  forget  these
          specifications,  and  retrieve  the ``head'' version of
          the file).

          The -j <i>branch</i> option merges the  changes  made  between
          the  resulting  revision  and  the  revision that it is
          based on (e.g., if the tag refers to a branch, cvs will
          merge all changes made in that branch into your working
          file).

          With two -j options, cvs  will  merge  in  the  changes
          between the two respective revisions.  This can be used
          to ``remove'' a certain delta from your working file.

          In addition, each -j option  can  contain  on  optional
          date  specification which, when used with branches, can
          limit the chosen revision  to  one  within  a  specific
          date.   An optional date is specified by adding a colon
          (:) to the tag.  An example might be what `cvs  import'
          tells  you  to  do  when you have just imported sources
          that have conflicts with local changes:

                    example% cvs checkout -jTAG:yesterday -jTAG module

          Use the -N option with `-d  <i>dir</i>'  to  avoid  shortening
          module  paths  in  your working directory.   (Normally,
          cvs shortens paths as much as possible when you specify
          an explicit target directory.)

          Use the -c option to copy the module file,  sorted,  to
          the  standard  output, instead of creating or modifying
          any files or directories in your working directory.

          Use the -d <i>dir</i> option to create a directory called  <i>dir</i>
          for  the  working  files,  instead  of using the module
          name.  Unless you also use -N, the paths created  under

          <i>dir</i> will be as short as possible.

          Use the -s option to display per-module status informa-
          tion stored with the -s option within the modules file.

          <i>Changes</i>: repository.
          <i>Synonym</i>: ci
          Use `cvs commit' when you want to  incorporate  changes
          from  your working source files into the general source
          repository.

          If you don't specify particular <i>files</i> to commit, all of
          the  files  in your working current directory are exam-
          ined.  commit is careful to change  in  the  repository
          only  those  files  that  you  have really changed.  By
          default (or if you explicitly specify the - R  option),
          files in subdirectories are also examined and committed
          if they have changed; you can use the   - l  option  to
          limit  commit to the current directory only.  Sometimes
          you may want to force  a  file  to  be  committed  even
          though  it  is  unchanged; this is achieved with the -f
          flag, which also has the effect of disabling  recursion
          (you can turn it back on with -R of course).

          commit verifies that the selected files are up to  date
          with the current revisions in the source repository; it
          will notify you, and exit without committing, if any of
          the  specified  files  must  be made current first with
          `cvs update'.  commit does not call the update  command
          for  you, but rather leaves that for you to do when the
          time is right.

          When all is well, an editor is invoked to allow you  to
          enter a log message that will be written to one or more
          logging programs and placed in the RCS  source  reposi-
          tory  file.  You can instead specify the log message on
          the command line with the -m option,  thus  suppressing
          the  editor invocation, or use the -F option to specify
          that the argument <i>file</i> contains the log message.

          The -r option can be used to  commit  to  a  particular
          symbolic  or numeric revision within the RCS file.  For
          example, to bring all your files up to the RCS revision
          ``3.0''  (including  those  that  haven't changed), you
          might do:

                    example% cvs commit -r3.0

          cvs will only allow you to commit to a revision that is
          on the main trunk (a revision with a single dot).  How-
          ever, you can also commit to  a  branch  revision  (one
          that  has  an  even number of dots) with the -r option.
          To create a branch revision, one typically use the  - b
          option  of  the  rtag  or  tag  commands.  Then, either
          checkout or update can be used to base your sources  on
          the newly created branch.  From that point on, all com-
          mit changes made within these working sources  will  be
          automatically  added  to a branch revision, thereby not
          perturbing main-line development in any way.  For exam-
          ple, if you had to create a patch to the 1.2 version of
          the product, even though the  2.0  version  is  already
          under development, you might do:

                    example% cvs rtag -b -rFCS1_2 FCS1_2_Patch product_module
                    example% cvs checkout -rFCS1_2_Patch product_module
                    example% cd product_module
                    [[ hack away ]]
                    example% cvs commit

          Say you have been working on some extremely  experimen-
          tal  software,  based on whatever revision you happened
          to checkout last week.  If others in your  group  would
          like  to  work  on  this software with you, but without
          disturbing main-line development, you could commit your
          change  to a new branch.  Others can then checkout your
          experimental stuff and utilize the full benefit of  cvs
          conflict resolution.  The scenario might look like:

                    example% cvs tag -b EXPR1
                    example% cvs update -rEXPR1
                    [[ hack away ]]
                    example% cvs commit

          Others  would   simply   do   `cvs   checkout   -rEXPR1
          whatever_module'  to  work with you on the experimental
          change.

          You can compare your working files  with  revisions  in
          the source repository, with the `cvs diff' command.  If
          you don't specify a particular revision, your files are
          compared  with  the  revisions they were based on.  You
          can also use the standard cvs command  option   - r  to
          specify  a  particular  revision  to compare your files
          with.  Finally, if you use   - r  twice,  you  can  see
          differences  between  two  revisions in the repository.

          You can also specify -D options to diff against a revi-
          sion  in  the past.  The -r and -D options can be mixed
          together with at most two options ever specified.

          See <a href="http://dylan/cgi-bin/man-cgi?rcsdiff+1">rcsdiff(1)</a> for a list of other accepted options.

          If you don't  specify  any  files,  diff  will  display
          differences  for  all those files in the current direc-
          tory (and its subdirectories, unless you use the  stan-
          dard  option   - l)  that differ from the corresponding
          revision in the source repository (i.e. files that  <i>you</i>
          have  changed), or that differ from the revision speci-
          fied.

          <i>Requires</i>: repository.
          <i>Changes</i>: current directory.
          This command is a variant of  `cvs  checkout';  use  it
          when  you  want a copy of the source for <i>module</i> without
          the cvs administrative directories.  For  example,  you
          might  use  `cvs export' to prepare source for shipment
          off-site.  This command <i>requires</i>  that  you  specify  a
          date  or  tag (with -D or -r), so that you can count on
          reproducing the source you ship to others.

          The only non-standard options are `-d <i>dir</i>'  (write  the
          source  into  directory  <i>dir</i>)  and  `-N' (don't shorten
          module paths).  These have the  same  meanings  as  the
          same options in `cvs checkout'.

          The -kv option is useful when  export  is  used.   This
          causes  any  RCS  keywords  to be expanded such that an
          import done at some other site will not lose  the  key-
          word  revision  information.   Other <i>kflag</i>s may be used
          with `cvs export' and are described in <a href="http://dylan/cgi-bin/man-cgi?co+1">co(1)</a>.

          cvs keeps a history file that tracks each  use  of  the
          checkout,  commit,  rtag, update, and release commands.
          You can use `cvs history' to display  this  information
          in various formats.

          <i>Warning</i>: `cvs history' uses `-f', `-l', `-n', and `- p'
          in  ways  that conflict with the descriptions in COMMON
          COMMAND OPTIONS.

          Several options (shown above as -<i>report</i>)  control  what
          kind of report is generated:

               Report on a particular <i>module</i>.  (You can  meaning-
               fully use -m more than once on the command line.)

           -o   Report on checked-out modules.

           -T   Report on all tags.

           -x <i>type</i>

               file is deleted during update (because it was gone
               from the repository); `U', when a working file was
               copied  from the repository; `G', when a merge was
               necessary and it succeeded; and 'C', when a  merge
               was   necessary   but   collisions  were  detected
               (requiring manual merging).  Finally, one of three
               record types results from commit: `M', when a file
               was modified; `A', when a file is first added; and
               `R', when a file is removed.

           -e   Everything  (all  record  types);  equivalent  to
               specifying `-xMACFROGWUT'.

           -z <i>zone</i>
               Use  time  zone  <i>zone</i>  when   outputting   history
               records.   The zone name LT stands for local time;
               numeric offsets stand for hours and minutes  ahead
               of UTC.  For example, +0530 stands for 5 hours and
               30 minutes ahead of (i.e. east of) UTC.

          The options  shown  as  - <i>flags</i>  constrain  the  report
          without requiring option arguments:

           -a   Show data for all users (the default is  to  show
               data only for the user executing `cvs history').

           -l   Show last modification only.

           -w   Show only the records for modifications done from
               the  same working directory where `cvs history' is
               executing.

          The options shown as -<i>options</i> <i>args</i> constrain the report
          based on an argument:

           -b <i>str</i>
               Show data back to a record containing  the  string
               <i>str</i>  in  either the module name, the file name, or
               the repository path.

           -D <i>date</i>
               Show data since <i>date</i>.

           -p <i>repository</i>
               Show data for a particular source repository  (you
               can specify several -p options on the same command
               line).

           -r <i>rev</i>
               Show records  referring  to  revisions  since  the
               revision  or  tag  named <i>rev</i> appears in individual
               RCS files.  Each RCS  file  is  searched  for  the
               revision or tag.

           -t <i>tag</i>
               Show records since tag <i>tag</i> was last added  to  the
               the  history  file.  This differs from the -r flag
               above in that it reads only the history file,  not
               the RCS files, and is much faster.

           -u <i>name</i>
               Show records for user <i>name</i>.

          Use `cvs import' to incorporate an entire  source  dis-
          tribution  from  an outside source (e.g., a source ven-
          dor) into your source repository  directory.   You  can
          use this command both for initial creation of a reposi-
          tory, and for wholesale updates to the module form  the
          outside source.

          The <i>repository</i> argument gives a directory  name  (or  a
          path  to  a directory) under the CVS root directory for
          repositories; if the directory did  not  exist,  import
          creates it.

          When you use import for updates to source that has been
          modified  in  your  source  repository  (since  a prior
          import), it will notify you of any files that  conflict
          in  the  two branches of development; use `cvs checkout
          -j' to reconcile the differences, as  import  instructs
          you to do.

CVS(1)                    User Commands                    CVS(1)

          By default, certain file names are ignored during  `cvs
          import':   names associated with CVS administration, or
          with other common source control systems; common  names
          for  patch files, object files, archive files, and edi-
          tor backup files; and  other  names  that  are  usually
          artifacts   of   assorted  utilities.   Currently,  the
          default list of ignored files includes  files  matching
          these names:

                    RCSLOG  RCS  SCCS
                    CVS*  cvslog.*
                    tags  TAGS
                    .make.state  .nse_depinfo
                    *~  #*  .#*  ,*
                    *.old  *.bak  *.BAK  *.orig  *.rej  .del-*
                    *.a  *.o  *.so  *.Z  *.elc  *.ln  core

          The outside  source  is  saved  in  a  first-level  RCS
          branch, by default `1.1.1'.  Updates are leaves of this
          branch; for example, files from the first imported col-
          lection  of  source  will  be  revision `1.1.1.1', then
          files from the first imported update will  be  revision
          `1.1.1.2', and so on.

          At least three arguments are required.   <i>repository</i>  is
          needed to identify the collection of source.  <i>vendortag</i>
          is a tag for the entire  branch  (e.g.,  for  `1.1.1').
          You  must also specify at least one <i>releasetag</i> to iden-
          tify the files at the leaves created each time you exe-
          cute `cvs import'.

          One of the standard cvs command options is available: -
          m  <i>message</i>.   If  you  do not specify a logging message
          with -m, your editor is invoked  (as  with  commit)  to
          allow you to enter one.

          There are three additional special options.

          Use `-d' to specify  that  each  file's  time  of  last
          modification  should  be  used for the checkin date and
          time.

          Use `-b <i>branch</i>' to specify a first-level  branch  other
          than `1.1.1'.

          Use `-I <i>name</i>' to specify  file  names  that  should  be
          ignored during import.  You can use this option repeat-
          edly.  To avoid ignoring any files at all  (even  those
          ignored by default), specify `-I !'.

          <i>Synonym</i>: rlog
          Display log information for <i>files</i>.  `cvs log' calls the
          RCS  utility rlog; all the options described in <a href="http://dylan/cgi-bin/man-cgi?rlog+1">rlog(1)</a>
          are available.  Among the more useful rlog options  are
          - h  to  display only the header (including tag defini-
          tions, but omitting most of the full log); -r to select
          logs  on  particular  revisions or ranges of revisions;
          and -d to select particular dates or date ranges.   See
          <a href="http://dylan/cgi-bin/man-cgi?rlog+1">rlog(1)</a>  for full explanations.  This command is recur-
          sive by default, unless the -l option is specified.

          Builds a Larry Wall format <a href="http://dylan/cgi-bin/man-cgi?patch+1">patch(1)</a>  file  between  two
          releases,  that can be fed directly into the patch pro-
          gram to bring an old release up-to-date  with  the  new
          release.   (This  is  one  of the few cvs commands that
          operates directly  from  the  repository,  and  doesn't
          require  a prior checkout.)  The diff output is sent to
          the standard output device.  You can specify (using the
          standard  - r and -D options) any combination of one or
          two revisions or dates.  If only one revision  or  date
          is  specified,  the  patch  file  reflects  differences
          between that revision or date and the current  ``head''
          revisions in the RCS file.

          Note that if the software release affected is contained
          in more than one directory, then it may be necessary to
          specify the -p option to the patch command when  patch-
          ing  the old sources, so that patch is able to find the
          files that are located in other directories.

          If you use the option -V <i>vn</i>, RCS keywords are  expanded
          according  to  the rules current in RCS version <i>vn</i> (the
          expansion format changed with RCS version 5).

          The standard option <i>flags</i> -f, and -l are available with
          this  command.   There are also several special options
          flags:

          If you use the -s option, no patch output is  produced.
          Instead,  a  summary  of  the  changed  or  added files
          between the two releases is sent to the standard output
          device.   This  is useful for finding out, for example,
          which files have changed between  two  dates  or  revi-
          sions.

          If you use the -t option, a diff of the top  two  revi-
          sions  is  sent to the standard output device.  This is

          most useful for seeing what the last change to  a  file
          was.

          If you use the -u option, the  patch  output  uses  the
          newer ``unidiff'' format for context diffs.

          You can use -c to explicitly specify the `diff -c' form
          of context diffs (which is the default), if you like.

     release [-dQq] <i>modules</i>...
          <i>Requires</i>: Working directory.
          <i>Changes</i>: Working directory, history log.
          This command is meant to safely cancel  the  effect  of
          `cvs  checkout'.'   Since  cvs  doesn't  lock files, it
          isn't strictly necessary to use this command.  You  can
          always  simply  delete  your  working directory, if you
          like; but you risk losing changes you may have  forgot-
          ten,  and  you  leave  no trace in the cvs history file
          that you've abandoned your checkout.

          Use `cvs release' to avoid these problems.   This  com-
          mand  checks  that no un-committed changes are present;
          that you are executing it from  immediately  above,  or
          inside,  a  cvs working directory; and that the reposi-
          tory recorded for your files is the same as the reposi-
          tory defined in the module database.

          If all these conditions are true, `cvs release'  leaves
          a record of its execution (attesting to your intention-
          ally abandoning your checkout) in the cvs history log.

          You can use the -d flag to request  that  your  working
          copies  of  the  source files be deleted if the release
          succeeds.

     remove [-lR] [<i>files</i>...]
          <i>Requires</i>: Working directory.
          <i>Changes</i>: Working directory.
          <i>Synonyms</i>: rm, delete
          Use this command to declare that  you  wish  to  remove
          <i>files</i>  from  the source repository.  Like most cvs com-
          mands, `cvs remove' works  on  files  in  your  working
          directory,  not directly on the repository.  As a safe-
          guard, it also requires that you first erase the speci-
          fied files from your working directory.

          The files are not actually removed until you apply your
          changes  to  the repository with commit; at that point,
          the corresponding RCS files in  the  source  repository
          are  <i>moved</i>  into the `Attic' directory (also within the
          source repository).

          This command is recursive by  default,  scheduling  all
          physically  removed  files that it finds for removal by
          the next commit.  Use the  - l  option  to  avoid  this
          recursion,  or  just specify that actual files that you
          wish remove to consider.

          <i>Requires</i>: repository.
          <i>Changes</i>: repository.
          <i>Synonym</i>: rfreeze
          You can use this command to  assign  symbolic  tags  to
          particular, explicitly specified source versions in the
          repository.  `cvs rtag' works directly on  the  reposi-
          tory  contents  (and  requires no prior checkout).  Use
          `cvs tag' instead, to base the selection of versions to
          tag on the contents of your working directory.

          In general, tags (often the symbolic names of  software
          distributions) should not be removed, but the -d option
          is available as a means to remove  completely  obsolete
          symbolic  names  if necessary (as might be the case for
          an Alpha release, say).

          `cvs rtag' will not move a  tag  that  already  exists.
          With  the -F option, however, `cvs rtag' will re-locate
          any instance of <i>symbolic</i>_<i>tag</i>  that  already  exists  on
          that  file to the new repository versions.  Without the
          -F option, attempting to use `cvs rtag' to apply a  tag
          that  already exists on that file will produce an error
          message.

          The -b option makes the tag a ``branch'' tag,  allowing
          concurrent,  isolated development.  This is most useful
          for creating a patch to a previously released  software
          distribution.

          You can use the standard -r and -D options to tag  only
          those  files  that already contain a certain tag.  This
          method would be used to rename  a  tag:  tag  only  the
          files  identified  by  the old tag, then delete the old
          tag, leaving the new tag on exactly the same  files  as
          the old tag.

          rtag executes recursively by default, tagging all  sub-
          directories  of  <i>modules</i>  you  specify in the argument.
          You can restrict its operation to top-level directories
          with  the  standard  - l  option; or you can explicitly
          request recursion with -R.

          The modules database can specify a program  to  execute

          whenever  a  tag is specified; a typical use is to send
          electronic mail to a group of interested  parties.   If
          you  want  to  bypass that program, use the standard -n
          option.

          Use the -a option to have rtag look in the `Attic'  for
          removed  files that contain the specified tag.  The tag
          is removed from these files, which makes it  convenient
          to  re-use a symbolic tag as development continues (and
          files get removed from the up-coming distribution).

     status [-lRqQ] [-v] [<i>files</i>...]
          <i>Requires</i>: working directory, repository.
          <i>Changes</i>: nothing.
          Display a brief report on the current status  of  <i>files</i>
          with  respect  to  the source repository, including any
          ``sticky'' tags, dates, or  - k  options.   (``Sticky''
          options  will  restrict how `cvs update' operates until
          you reset them; see the description of  `cvs  update  -
          A...'.)

          You can also use this command to anticipate the  poten-
          tial  impact  of  a `cvs update' on your working source
          directory.  If you do not specify any <i>files</i> explicitly,
          reports  are shown for all files that cvs has placed in
          your working directory.  You can  limit  the  scope  of
          this  search  to  the current directory itself (not its
          subdirectories) with the standard -l  option  flag;  or
          you  can  explicitly  request  recursive status reports
          with the -R option.

          The -v option causes the symbolic tags for the RCS file
          to be displayed as well.

          <i>Synonym</i>: freeze
          Use this command to assign symbolic tags to the nearest
          repository  versions to your working sources.  The tags
          are applied immediately  to  the  repository,  as  with
          rtag.

          One use for tags is to record  a  ``snapshot''  of  the
          current sources when the software freeze date of a pro-
          ject arrives.  As bugs are fixed after the freeze date,
          only  those  changed sources that are to be part of the
          release need be re-tagged.

          The symbolic tags are meant to permanently record which

          revisions  of  which  files  were  used  in  creating a
          software distribution.  The checkout, export and update
          commands allow you to extract an exact copy of a tagged
          release at  any  time  in  the  future,  regardless  of
          whether  files  have  been  changed,  added, or removed
          since the release was tagged.

          You can use the standard -r and -D options to tag  only
          those  files  that already contain a certain tag.  This
          method would be used to rename  a  tag:  tag  only  the
          files  identified  by  the old tag, then delete the old
          tag, leaving the new tag on exactly the same  files  as
          the old tag.

          Specifying the -f flag in addition to the  - r  or  - D
          flags  will  tag  those files named on the command line
          even if they do not contain the  old  tag  or  did  not
          exist on the specified date.

          tagged  are  supplied  implicitly by the cvs records of
          your working files' history rather than applied  expli-
          citly.

          If you use `cvs tag -d <i>symbolic</i>_<i>tag</i>...',  the  symbolic
          tag  you  specify  is  <i>deleted</i>  instead of being added.
          <i>Warning</i>: Be very certain  of  your  ground  before  you
          delete a tag; doing this effectively discards some his-
          torical information, which may later turn out  to  have
          been valuable.

          `cvs tag' will not move  a  tag  that  already  exists.
          With  the  -F option, however, `cvs tag' will re-locate
          any instance of <i>symbolic</i>_<i>tag</i>  that  already  exists  on
          that  file to the new repository versions.  Without the
          -F option, attempting to use `cvs tag' to apply  a  tag
          that  already exists on that file will produce an error
          message.

          The -b option makes the tag a ``branch'' tag,  allowing
          concurrent,  isolated development.  This is most useful
          for creating a patch to a previously released  software
          distribution.

          Normally, tag executes  recursively  through  subdirec-
          tories;  you  can prevent this by using the standard -l
          option, or specify the recursion explicitly by using  -
          R.

          After you've run checkout to create your  private  copy
          of  source from the common repository, other developers
          will continue changing the central source.   From  time
          to time, when it is convenient in your development pro-
          cess, you can use the update command from  within  your
          working directory to reconcile your work with any revi-
          sions applied to  the source repository since your last
          checkout or update.

          update keeps you informed of its progress by printing a
          line for each file, prefaced with one of the characters
          `U A R M C ?'  to indicate the status of the file:

     U <i>file</i>    The file was brought <i>up</i> <i>to</i> <i>date</i>  with  respect  to
               the  repository.   This  is done for any file that
               exists in the repository but not in  your  source,
               and for files that you haven't changed but are not
               the most recent versions available in the  reposi-
               tory.

     A <i>file</i>    The file has been <i>added</i> to your  private  copy  of
               the  sources,  and will be added to the RCS source
               repository when you run `cvs commit' on the  file.
               This  is  a reminder to you that the file needs to
               be committed.

     R <i>file</i>    The file has been <i>removed</i> from your  private  copy
               of  the  sources, and will be removed from the RCS
               source repository when you run `cvs commit' on the
               file.   This  is  a  reminder to you that the file
               needs to be committed.

     M <i>file</i>    The file is <i>modified</i> in  your  working  directory.
               `M'  can  indicate  one  of  two states for a file
               you're working on: either there were no  modifica-
               tions  to the same file in the repository, so that
               your file remains as you last  saw  it;  or  there
               were modifications in the repository as well as in
               your copy,  but  they  were  <i>merged</i>  successfully,
               without conflict, in your working directory.

     C <i>file</i>    A <i>conflict</i> was detected while trying to merge your
               changes to <i>file</i> with changes from the source repo-
               sitory.  <i>file</i> (the copy in your working directory)
               is  now  the  output of the <a href="http://dylan/cgi-bin/man-cgi?rcsmerge+1">rcsmerge(1)</a> command on
               the two versions; an unmodified copy of your  file
               is  also  in your working directory, with the name
               `.#<i>file</i>.<i>version</i>', where <i>version</i> is the  RCS  revi-
               sion  that your modified file started from.  (Note
               that some systems automatically purge  files  that
               begin  with    `.#' if they have not been accessed
               for a few days.  If you intend to keep a  copy  of

               your  original  file,  it  is  a very good idea to
               rename it.)

     ? <i>file</i>    <i>file</i> is in your working directory,  but  does  not
               correspond  to  anything in the source repository,
               and is not in the list of files for cvs to  ignore
               (see the description of the -I option).

          Use the -A option to reset any sticky tags, dates, or -
          k  options.   (If  you  get a working copy of a file by
          using one of the -r, -D, or -k options,  cvs  remembers
          the  corresponding  tag,  date,  or <i>kflag</i> and continues
          using it on future updates; use the -A option  to  make
          cvs  forget  these  specifications,  and  retrieve  the
          ``head'' version of the file).

          The -j<i>branch</i> option merges the changes made between the
          resulting revision and the revision that it is based on
          (e.g., if the tag refers to a branch,  cvs  will  merge
          all  changes  made  in  that  branch  into your working
          file).

          With two -j options, cvs  will  merge  in  the  changes
          between the two respective revisions.  This can be used
          to ``remove'' a certain delta from your  working  file.
          E.g.,  If the file foo.c is based on revision 1.6 and I
          want to remove the changes made between 1.3 and 1.5,  I
          might do:

                    example% cvs update -j1.5 -j1.3 foo.c   # note the order...

          In addition, each -j option  can  contain  on  optional
          date  specification which, when used with branches, can
          limit the chosen revision  to  one  within  a  specific
          date.   An optional date is specified by adding a colon
          (:) to the tag.

                    -jSymbolic_Tag:Date_Specifier

          Use the -d option to create any directories that  exist
          in  the  repository if they're missing from the working
          directory.  (Normally, update acts only on  directories
          and  files  that  were already enrolled in your working
          directory.)  This is useful  for  updating  directories
          that  were  created in the repository since the initial
          checkout; but it has an unfortunate  side  effect.   If
          you  deliberately  avoided  certain  directories in the
          repository when  you  created  your  working  directory
          (either  through  use  of  a  module name or by listing
          explicitly the files and directories you wanted on  the
          command  line), then updating with -d will create those
          directories, which may not be what you want.

          Use -I <i>name</i> to ignore files whose names match <i>name</i>  (in
          your  working  directory)  during  the update.  You can
          specify -I more  than  once  on  the  command  line  to
          specify  several  files  to ignore.  By default, update
          ignores files whose names match any of the following:

                    RCSLOG  RCS  SCCS
                    CVS*  cvslog.*

                    *.a  *.o  *.so  *.Z  *.elc  *.ln  core

          Use `-I !'  to avoid ignoring any files at all.

          The standard cvs command options -f, -k, -l, - P,  - p,
          and -r are also available with update.

     <a href="http://dylan/cgi-bin/man-cgi?cvs+5">cvs(5)</a>.

     <i>Files</i> <i>in</i> <i>home</i> <i>directories</i>:

     .cvsrc
          The cvs initialisation file.  Lines in this file can be
          used  to  specify default options for each cvs command.
          For example the line `diff -c' will  ensure  that  `cvs
          diff' is always passed the -c option in addition to any
          other options passed on the command line.

     .cvswrappers
          Specifies wrappers to be  used  in  addition  to  those
          specified  in the CVSROOT/cvswrappers file in the repo-
          sitory.

     <i>Files</i> <i>in</i> <i>working</i> <i>directories</i>:

     CVS  A  directory  of  cvs  administrative  files.   <i>Do</i>  <i>not</i>

          Pathname to the repository ( CVSROOT ) location at  the
          time  of  checkout.   This  file is used instead of the
          CVSROOT environment variable if the  environment  vari-
          able is not set.  A warning message will be issued when
          the contents of this file and the  CVSROOT  environment
          variable  differ.   The  file may be over-ridden by the
          presence  of  the  CVS_IGNORE_REMOTE_ROOT   environment
          variable.

     CVS/Repository
          Pathname to the corresponding directory in  the  source
          repository.

     CVS/Tag
          Contains  the  per-directory  ``sticky''  tag  or  date
          information.   This  file  is  created/updated when you
          specify -r or -D to the checkout  or  update  commands,
          and no files are specified.

     CVS/Checkin.prog
          Name of program to run on `cvs commit'.

     CVS/Update.prog
          Name of program to run on `cvs update'.

     $CVSROOT/CVSROOT
          Directory of global administrative  files  for  reposi-
          tory.

     CVSROOT/commitinfo,v
          Records programs for filtering `cvs commit' requests.

     CVSROOT/cvswrappers,v
          Records cvs wrapper commands to be used  when  checking
          files  into  and out of the repository.  Wrappers allow
          the file or directory to be processed on the way in and
          out  of  CVS.  The intended uses are many, one possible
          use would be to reformat a C file before  the  file  is
          checked  in, so all of the code in the repository looks
          the same.

     CVSROOT/editinfo,v
          Records programs for  editing/validating  `cvs  commit'
          log entries.

     CVSROOT/history
          Log file of cvs transactions.

     CVSROOT/loginfo,v
          Records programs for piping `cvs commit' log entries.

          Temporary lock file for repository.

     #cvs.rfl.<i>pid</i>
          A read lock.

     #cvs.wfl.<i>pid</i>

<H3>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H3>
     CVSROOT
          Should contain the full pathname to the root of the cvs
          source repository (where the RCS files are kept).  This
          information must be available to cvs for most  commands
          to  execute;  if  CVSROOT is not set, or if you wish to
          override it for one invocation, you can  supply  it  on
          the command line:  `cvs -d <i>cvsroot</i> <i>cvs</i>_<i>command</i>...'  You
          may not need to set CVSROOT if your cvs binary has  the
          right  path  compiled  in;  use `cvs -v' to display all
          compiled-in paths.

     CVSREAD
          If this is set, checkout and update will  try  hard  to
          make  the  files  in  your working directory read-only.
          When this is not set, the default behavior is to permit
          modification of your working files.

     RCSBIN
          Specifies the full pathname where to find RCS programs,
          such  as  <a href="http://dylan/cgi-bin/man-cgi?co+1">co(1)</a>  and  <a href="http://dylan/cgi-bin/man-cgi?ci+1">ci(1)</a>.  If not set, a compiled-in
          value is used; see the display from `cvs -v'.

     CVSEDITOR
          Specifies the program to use for recording log messages

          during  commit.   If  not  set,  the EDITOR environment
          variable is used instead.  If EDITOR is not set either,
          the default is /usr/ucb/vi.

     CVS_IGNORE_REMOTE_ROOT
          If this variable is set then cvs will ignore all refer-
          ences to remote repositories in the CVS/Root file.

     CVS_RSH
          cvs uses the contents of this variable to determine the
          name of the remote shell command to use when starting a
          cvs server.  If this variable is not set then `rsh'  is
          used.

     CVS_SERVER
          cvs uses the contents of this variable to determine the
          name  of  the  cvs server command.  If this variable is
          not set then `cvs' is used.

     CVSWRAPPERS
          This variable is used by the  `cvswrappers'  script  to
          determine  the name of the wrapper file, in addition to
          the  wrappers  defaults  contained  in  the  repository
          (CVSROOT/cvswrappers)  and  the  user's  home directory
          (~/.cvswrappers).
