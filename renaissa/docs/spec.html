<h2> <img src="./pics/bullet.gif"> <a name="intro"> Introduction </a> </h2>
<p>

Since the creation of the Spinner project, which blossomed into Online Media and Acorn Network Computing the source trees used to create releases for the Set Top Box/NC and RISC OS desktop computer have been steadily diverging.
<p>
This has a number of disadvantages, both from the purist and the practical viewpoint. These have been brought to a head by the need to produce a StrongARM version of NC OS, which involves amalgamating the ART StrongARM RISC OS 3.7 source with NC OS.
<p>
The StrongARM NC OS build is the driving force for the deadline on this project - November 5. Since that date is in the aftermath of Acorn World, the project will be planned to finish at the end of October.
<p>

<h2> <img src="./pics/bullet.gif"> <a name="process"> The process in detail </a> </h2>
<p>

As is so often the case the actual task to be performed is a lot more complicated than merging together two sets of files. The big complication is that there are actually more than two source trees involved.
<p>
ART has separate source trees for Black (RISC OS 3.60+) and StrongARM RISC OS 3.70. These must be merged. It is also possible that source files from the Aquarius (Toolbox) and Skynet (Multimedia) trees may need to be moved across.
<p>
The Spinner source tree can build for OS targets Falcon, Omega2 and Omega4 (STB2 and NC with 2 or 4 MB ROM). Both major ART trees build for Morris2 and Morris4 (A7000 with 2 or 4MB ROM).
<p>

<h3> <a name="merge"> How the merging will proceed </a> </h3>
<p>

Two virgin Risc PCs will be used. One will be populated with the Black, StrongARM and Spinner source trees at their current release level (ie previous versions will not be copied) plus the new source tree. The new source tree will be accessed through !SrcFiler to ensure that locking and change tracking occur.
<p>
The second system will use ShareFS to access the new source tree and copies of the old trees. Again, !SrcFiler will be used. While both engineers will largely work autonomously in different areas of the trees the new tree will be under source control from the outset to ensure no clashes are possible.
<p>
Two tasks will occur in parallel. The first task is to merge the Black and StrongARM trees. This is slightly easier than the later merge with Spinner because the same targets are largely involved. This will produce one definitive ART RISC OS source tree. The second task is to vet the elements of the Spinner source tree which have diverged from RISC OS 3.60 for StrongARM infelicities.
<p>
The merging of Black and StrongARM will be accomplished using Diff to analyse differences, taking the StrongARM tree as the base to which any deviations in the Black tree will be applied.
<p>
Source modules in the Black and StrongARM trees will be locked as they are input to the merging process. This lock will remain for ever, since each module will eventually emerge in the new source tree.
<p>
Spinner modules which have StrongARM infelicities identified will be locked in the Spinner tree, and again will remain locked for ever. Other Spinner modules will not be locked until later in the process.
<p>
When these parallel tasks are complete work will commence on merging the combined 3.60/3.70 trees with the Spinner tree. Modules in the 3.60/3.70 trees will already by locked out. Modules in the Spinner tree will be locked as they are input to the merging process (unless they've already been locked when StrongARM infelicities were detected).
<p>
When the merger is complete the new source tree opens for business by both ART and ANC. Details of the mount will be released nearer this time.
<p>

<h3> <a name="custom"> Customising sources </a> </h3>
<p>

The build system already has the notion of Machine, Locale, Keyboard, System and ImageSize. The Machine file leads to a directory within the BuildSys which describes the target in greater detail.
<p>
The Machine and ImageSize headers are referenced by various components in the build, notably the kernel.
<p>
An existing switch 'STB' can be used for including STB-only items or RISC OS desktop computer-only items. A StrongARM switch will also be defined to govern changes brought across.
<p>
Some StrongARM source is switched by a source flag but this does not apply universally.
<p>

<h3> <a name="problems"> "It's worse than that..." </a> </h3>
<p>

Inevitably the process of merging divergent trees will throw up a number of problems which will need to be considered at the time. However the majority can be foreseen:
<blockquote>
<h4> Duplication of relocatable module version numbers </h4>

Cannot be helped now. The version number in the new tree will be higher than any existing number.
  
<h4> Incompatible divergent changes </h4>

Use the STB or StrongARM switches as appropriate.
  
<h4> Different make scripts </h4>

A compound makefile will be created.
  
<h4> Recalcitrant sources </h4>

Some sources always give trouble in their construction, where possible the process will be made robust.
  
<h4> Differing components </h4>

The number and detail of network components included varies between the three trees under consideration. In extremis resolving this could involve different source modules which are only included by a particular build.
  
<h4> Broken components </h4>

It may be the case that where a tree has not seen a full build in some time (eg Black) that components do not build properly or function properly. Where this is discovered the first course of action will be to seek assistance from the engineer who made the most recent changes. Failing that the project team will attempt to get the component to the point where it builds, but will not perform further work on the source module unless it is of critical importance to the joint tree. A broken component will be recorded by a comment in the new change log for that source module.

<h4> Duplicate unique resource allocations </h4>

This will occur if, for example, both NC/OM and ART have allocated new SWIs from within a module's (or the kernel's) assigned chunk. If the duplicates are mutually exclusive then the different build variants may include the appropriate one.
  Where this is not the case one of the allocations must move. Generally this will be the ANC side of the clash sinch their API is not published.
  
<h4> StrongARM issues </h4>

Generally the worst area for existing code is the use of run-time code generation. This will fail unless a cache flush is caused.
  
One area where this will cause difficult is in SWI veneers for C. This project will standardise upon the use of supported SWI veneers within the C library.  
</blockquote>
<p>

<h3> <a name="header"> Importing Header Files </a> </h3>
<p>

In general, this project will <b>not</b> attempt to clean or otherwise prettify the source tree. However, one change is long overdue.
<p>
Those headers which feature uniquely allocated resources were moved out of the Black tree to another source tree, consequently they should be regarded as an import to the new tree rather than an internal component. This includes the header files which declare SWI chunk names/numbers, filetypes, service calls etc.
<p>

<h3> <a name="audit"> Testing and Auditing </a> </h3>
<p>

This project has neither the time nor resources to perform a full audit on the changes it makes, consequently changes will be tested in the following manner.
<p>
A compound source will be built for each of its defined target platforms and the resultant code checked. Where the result should be exactly the same as one of the input source modules the test can be a binary comparison.
<p>
Where the compound source differs from all of its input sources the result will be functionally checked as part of an OS image and the changes rechecked by performing a diff comparison between the compound and each of its inputs. This should only highlight deliberate changes - anything else is an error in transcription.
<p>

<h2> <img src="./pics/bullet.gif"> <a name="issues"> Issues </a> </h2>
<p>

This is a high-risk project. The following risks and issues have been identified.
<p>

<h3> <a name="scope"> Scope </a> </h3>
<p>

The three major source trees involved have been diverging for a number of months. The full gamut of changes made will not be apparent until the systems capable of handling the amount of data involved in four source trees have been set up (the fourth is the new tree).
<p>
This is an unknown, and the prime reason for the present resolve not to undertake anything more than the core task within the remit of this project.
<p>

<h3> <a name="garbage"> Garbage in </a> </h3>
<p>

The state of the input source trees will affect the ease of performing the task.
<p>
The Spinner tree has undergone a number of builds, so will be in good shape. However it cannot be guaranteed that all STB changes are controlled by the STB source flag.
<p>
The RISC OS 3.7 tree has also been built very recently. However the concern here is that the sources have not been under change control, thus unwinding any changes or backtracking alterations will not be possible.
<p>
The Black tree is the unknown quantity. It has been active since the RISC OS 3.60 build, and not been built for release since. Consequently there are likely to be some components presently unable to build or containing serious bugs.
<p>

<h3> <a name="resource"> Resourcing </a> </h3>
<p>

The project is currently resourced with approximately 1.5 people. If the scale of the work involved appears overwhelming it may be necessary to hire additional contract resource. Fortunately this will generally be for rote tasks so finding suitable people should not be that difficult within the timescale.
<p>

<h3> <a name="developers"> Other developers </a> </h3>
<p>

As a source module is input to the merging process it will be locked in all its input source trees. Since this means that a source cannot be checked out during the duration of the merging it may be necessary for developers who absolutely <b>have</b> to work on a source module so affected to perform changes on a local version of the source and then merge it in with the combined source module themselves when the new module is available.
<p>
The merging process also assumes that sources are unlocked and at a safe point to be input to the merging process - some developers have a practice of checking in non-functional sources in order to record a landmark within the implementation of some complex change. In extremis it will be necessary to perform the source merging with a previous version of any source modules in this situation.
<p>
To ameliorate these issues full details of the work in progress will be circulated to all developers advising them of the nature of this project and how to co-operate with it. A high degree of co-operation, and in some cases a little time, from each developer will be necessary to the smooth running of this project within its allotted timescale.
<p>

<h3> <a name="dependencies"> Dependencies </a> </h3>
<p>

Care will be required to successfully cope with multi-source dependencies - for instance the RISC OS 3.70 Window Manager requires features moved to the Kernel in that release. Where possible source switches will be introduced at build level to control such changes (if this has not been done already).
