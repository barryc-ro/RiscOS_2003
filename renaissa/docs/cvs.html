<h2><a name="outstanding">Outstanding issues</a></h2>
The following have not been documented here so far and probably should be...
<ul>
  <li> None
</ul>

<p>
<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>

CSV (Concurrent Version System) is a source control system that allows files to be independently edited and automatically merged when updates are committed. Acorn is moving towards using CVS for control of the RiscOS sources and project documentation.
<p>
All files placed under CVS control reside within a CVS repository.  There are a few core commands which allow you to perform operations on the repository.  CVS is able to work on the whole tree just as well as it works on individual modules or files.
<p>
There are two ways of retrieving files from the CVS repository, known as checking out, and exporting, which differ in that checking out create CVS administrive files in every directory, but exporting does not. When retrieving files for full builds or for for final release, the administrative files should not be present, as thay can easily cause problems (force files/directory limits to be hit, find their way into ResourceFS, etc).  When making modifications to a file, CVS will need the administrative files to merge changes back into the repository.

<p>
<h2><a name="environment">Environment</a></h2>

CVS is a unix command line tool installed on valhalla. To access this you therefore need an interactive login on valhalla and a reasonable amount of free space on your home mount (enough for any checked out files). The following unix environment variables require setting. This should ideally be done as part of your startup scripts such as .cshrc or .bashrc.
<p>
For csh users:
<blockquote>
<pre>
<b> setenv EDITOR vi </b> or other if preferred
<b> setenv CVSROOT /projects2/renaissa/cvsroot </b>
<b> set path = ( $path /projects2/renaissa/bin ) </b>
<b> umask 2 </b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
For bash users:
<blockquote>
<pre>
<b> export EDITOR=vi </b>
<b> export CVSROOT=/projects2/renaissa/cvsroot </b>
<b> export PATH=$PATH:/projects2/renaissa/bin </b>
<b> umask 2 </b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
For RISC OS users:
<blockquote>
<pre>
<b> set CVSROOT :pserver:jsmith@valhalla:/projects2/renaissa/cvsroot
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The binary for cvs can be found in <b>/usr/local/bin</b> on valhalla, you should ensure you have this directory on your search path. See the <a href="riscoscvs.html">RISC OS CVS page</a> for details of the RISC OS port of cvs.
<p>
If you are accessing valhalla though a telnet session on a RiscPC, !FreeTerm is recommended in preference to !VT220 as normally supplied.
<p>
Scripts referred to in this document can be found in <b>/projects2/renaissa/bin.</b> The scripts themselves are under CVS source control and automatically placed in this directory whenever changes are made to them.

<p>
<h2><a name="deficiencies">Known deficiencies</a></h2>

<h3><a name="def_directories">Directories</a></h3>

Although files can have 'tags' attached to indicate that the files are present in a particular release, it is not possible to put a similar tags on directories.  Directories are created during an export or checkout, if they contain any files.
<p>
This behaviour breaks the build of RiscOS modules, as the 'rm' and 'o' directories don't contain files.  It was decided that all empty directories should contain a file, to force those directories to be created. This file is called <b>.cvstag</b>. Scripts have been provided to automatically create these tag files when importing modules into the cvs repository and remove them on export. See <a href="#build_import">Importing files</a>.

<p>
<h2><a name="users">Notes for CVS users </a> </h2>

<p>
<h3><a name="user_examine"> Examining the repository </a></h3>

To find out what is in the repository, the command cvsls is provided.
It works much like the ls command, but examines the repository instead
of the current directory.  It is a little crude, but simple and should
be sufficient.  For example:

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>% cvsls RiscOS/Sources/Apps</b>
Boot            Help            NCFiler         NCWriter
FlashProg       NCConfig        NCFresco        SCProgram
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
<h3><a name="user_checkout"> Checking out files </a></h3>

Files are checked out in order to make modifications to a module. Individual files or whole directories can be checked out using the command <b>cvs checkout</b> as described below.
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
either  <b>cvs checkout -r Spinner [module name] </b>
or      <b>cvs co -r Spinner [module name] </b>
example <b>cvs checkout -r Spinner RiscOS/Sources/Kernel </b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Where <CODE>[module name]</CODE> is the full path to the module from the root of the repository. 
<p>The checked out version will be copied to the current working directory with all directories in the hierarchy created (if not already present), so you should ensure that the current directory is set to where you want the root of your working directory to be, before running <code>cvs checkout</code>.
<p>If you forget to do this, and run <CODE>cvs checkout</CODE> with the current directory set to somewhere inside your working directory (for example), cvs will create new subdirectories as required, resulting in an extremely deep directory trees for the checked out files.
<p>The checked out version will contain CVS control files along with the <CODE>.cvstag</CODE> files mentioned earlier. These should not be deleted as they are required by CVS when checking changes back into the repository.
<p>
The "-r Spinner" option ensures that work is done on the CVS branch labelled Spinner. The branch you should use will depend on both the project and the files you are working on.

<p>
<h3><a name="user_commit">   Committing changes </a></h3>

Once files have been edited and are ready for committing back into the repository, the following commands should be issued.
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
either  <b>cvs commit [filename] </b>
or      <b>cvs ci [filename] </b>
example <b>cvs commit Makefile </b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If no filename is specified, all files in the current working directory are committed into the repository (if they have changed). CVS locates the files in the repository using the CVS control files created by the checkout process.
<p>
When checking in, CVS will first check that the files in the working directory are up to date.  If modifications have been made to the repository version in the time between the files being checked out and them being committed, CVS will complain, and suggest using the update command.
<p>
If a file does not already exist in the respository it is not committed by default. Therefore no object files will be committed. If a new source file has been added, this requires explicit addition to the repository using the following command.
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
        <b>cvs add [filename] </b>
example <b>cvs add newsrc </b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
When performing this command, you should be in the directory containing the file - <CODE>cvs add</CODE> only accepts a <EM>leafname</EM>. If the file to be added is a binary, for example a sprite, the following command should be used instead to change the way CVS stores the file internally.
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
        <b>cvs add -kb [binary filename] </b>
example <b>cvs add -kb !Sprites </b>
</pre>
</blockquote>


<p>
<h3><a name="user_update">   Updating files </a></h3>

A set of checked out files can become stale by someone else independantly editing them and checking their changes back into the repository. Updating your copy of the files using the following command will replace any stale files and automatically merge any changes into modified files.
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
        <b>cvs update </b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
You should be in the directory containing the files when issuing this command.
<p>
If you want to find out what the effect of an update command will be, you can use the following command.  This will display a list of files with a letter indicating the status of the file.
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
	<b>cvs -nq update </b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The letters used are:
<p>
<blockquote>
	<b>U</b> File would be brought up to date.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<b>A</b> File has been created in your working directory.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<b>R</b> File has been removed from your working directory.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<b>M</b> File has been modified in your working directory.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<b>C</b> Changes made in working directory conflict with changes made by someone else.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<b>?</b> File is in the working directory, but does not correspond to a file in the repository.
</blockquote>
<p>
<CODE>cvs -nq update</CODE> can thus tell you the information you will usually want to know about the status of files in the current directory.
<p>
<h3><a name="user_newmodule"> New module </a></h3>

A typical task for a CVS user would be to add a new module to the build tree. This is demonstrated below by adding a new Networking module.
<p>
Firstly, checkout the directory structure required (the -l flag will only checkout specified directory, not the directories below it). Then move into this directory and create the new module directory.
<blockquote>
<pre>
        <b>cvs checkout -r Spinner -l RiscOS/Sources/Networking</b>
        <b>cd RiscOS/Sources/Networking</b>
        <b>mkdir NewModule</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
Now tell CVS that is this a new module to be added to the repository.
<blockquote>
<pre>
        <b>cvs add NewModule</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that <CODE>cvs add</CODE> only accepts a <EM>leafname</EM>.
<p>Create all the new files requred by the module in this directory then explicitly add them to the repository using the <b>cvs add</b> and <b>cvs add -kb</b> commands described earlier. Finally commit all the new files.
<blockquote>
<pre>
        <b>cvs commit</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
Adding log entries as prompted.
<p>

<h2><a name="builders"> Notes for build administrators. </a> </h2>

<p>
<h3><a name="build_export">Exporting files</a></h3>

Files are exported in order to build, or release a module.  Since files (.cvstag) are created in empty directories, they must be deleted before the module is compiled.  This is fairly easy to do with a couple of commands, but it is made even easier by the existance of a script <b>cvsexport</b>. This will call CVS to export a module, and then remove all files named .cvstag in the newly created directory. An example would be:
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>cvsexport -r NC_1_06 RiscOS</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This process takes about between 1 and 4 hours for the whole build tree depending on valhalla loading.

<p>
<h3><a name="build_import">Importing files</a></h3>

Importing is used to bring a module under CVS control. To make sure that empty directories are created on checkout and export, the .cvstag files need creating. This can be done by using the <b>cvsimport</b> script. The script should be invoked from the module directory. An example would be:
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
cvsimport <destination directory> <branch name> <import tag>
<b>cvsimport RiscOS/Sources/Kernel Daytona initial</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This will recursively import all the files in the <b>current</b> working
directory onto the branch named Daytona, tagged as <i>initial</i> (The tag
name 'initial' is advised for consistancy. To import the files onto the TRUNK
only, specify <b>TRUNK</b> as the branch name.

<p>
A script is also provided to ensure all files with particular RiscOS
filetypes are marked as binaries by CVS. This is called <b>cvsbinaries</b>
and works on a checked out tree, performing a administrative command to mark
files as binary.

<p>
<h3><a name="branches">Branches</a></h3>

The branch number given should normally be non-existant, as otherwise the branch tags on that branch become unusable. The branch number should be odd, as even numbers can be used by CVS. The branches and tags currently in use are:
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
  Number   Tag         Description
  4.1.1    Black       Used to import RiscOS 360 from the CD
  4.1.3    StrongARM   Used to import RiscOS 370 from the CD
  4.1.5    STB         Used to import NCOS 1.06 from SrcFiler
</pre>
</blockquote>
