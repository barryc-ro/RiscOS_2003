RCS(1)                    User Commands                    RCS(1)

<H3>NAME</H3>
     rcs - change RCS file attributes

<H3>SYNOPSIS</H3>
     rcs <i>options</i> <i>file</i> ...

<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
     rcs creates new RCS files or changes attributes of  existing
     ones.   An  RCS file contains multiple revisions of text, an
     access list, a change log, descriptive text, and  some  con-
     trol  attributes.   For rcs to work, the caller's login name
     must be on the access list, except if  the  access  list  is
     empty, the caller is the owner of the file or the superuser,
     or the -i option is present.

     Pathnames matching an RCS suffix denote RCS files; all  oth-
     ers  denote working files.  Names are paired as explained in
     <a href="./man.cgi?ci+1">ci(1)</a>.  Revision numbers use the syntax described in <a href="./man.cgi?ci+1">ci(1)</a>.

<H3>OPTIONS</H3>
     -i    Create and initialize a new RCS file, but do not depo-
          sit  any revision.  If the RCS file has no path prefix,
          try to place it first into the subdirectory ./RCS,  and
          then  into  the  current  directory.   If  the RCS file
          already exists, print an error message.

     -a<i>logins</i>
          Append the login names appearing in the comma-separated
          list <i>logins</i> to the access list of the RCS file.

     -A<i>oldfile</i>
          Append the access list of <i>oldfile</i> to the access list of
          the RCS file.

     -e[<i>logins</i>]
          Erase the login names appearing in the  comma-separated
          list  <i>logins</i>  from the access list of the RCS file.  If
          <i>logins</i> is omitted, erase the entire access list.

     -b[<i>rev</i>]
          Set the default branch to <i>rev</i>.  If <i>rev</i> is omitted,  the
          default  branch  is  reset to the (dynamically) highest
          branch on the trunk.

     -c<i>string</i>
          Set the comment leader to <i>string</i>.  An initial ci, or an
          rcs  -i without -c, guesses the comment leader from the
          suffix of the working filename.

          This option is obsolescent, since RCS normally uses the
          preceding  $Log$
          preceding  Revision 1.1  1996/12/05 15:16:11  rbuckley
          preceding  First created using man-cgi.
          preceding line's prefix when inserting log lines
          during checkout (see <a href="./man.cgi?co+1">co(1)</a>).  However,  older  versions

          of  RCS  use  the  comment  leader instead of the $Log$
          of  RCS  use  the  comment  leader instead of the Revision 1.1  1996/12/05 15:16:11  rbuckley
          of  RCS  use  the  comment  leader instead of the First created using man-cgi.
          of  RCS  use  the  comment  leader instead of the
          line's prefix, so if you plan to  access  a  file  with
          both old and new versions of RCS, make sure its comment
          leader matches its $Log$
          leader matches its Revision 1.1  1996/12/05 15:16:11  rbuckley
          leader matches its First created using man-cgi.
          leader matches its line prefix.

     -k<i>subst</i>
          Set the default keyword  substitution  to  <i>subst</i>.   The
          effect  of  keyword substitution is described in <a href="./man.cgi?co+1">co(1)</a>.
          Giving an explicit  - k  option  to  co,  rcsdiff,  and
          rcsmerge  overrides  this  default.   Beware  rcs  -kv,
          because -kv is incompatible with co -l.  Use rcs  - kkv
          to restore the normal default keyword substitution.

     -l[<i>rev</i>]
          Lock the revision with number  <i>rev</i>.   If  a  branch  is
          given, lock the latest revision on that branch.  If <i>rev</i>
          is omitted, lock the latest  revision  on  the  default
          branch.   Locking  prevents  overlapping  changes.   If
          someone else already holds the lock, the lock is broken
          as with rcs -u (see below).

     -u[<i>rev</i>]
          Unlock the revision with number <i>rev</i>.  If  a  branch  is
          given,  unlock  the latest revision on that branch.  If
          <i>rev</i> is omitted, remove the  latest  lock  held  by  the
          caller.   Normally,  only  the locker of a revision can
          unlock it.  Somebody else unlocking a  revision  breaks
          the lock.  This causes a mail message to be sent to the
          original locker.  The  message  contains  a  commentary
          solicited  from  the  breaker.   The commentary is ter-
          minated by end-of-file or by  a  line  containing  . by
          itself.

     -L    Set locking to <i>strict</i>.  Strict locking means that  the
          owner  of  an  RCS  file is not exempt from locking for
          checkin.  This option should be used for files that are
          shared.

     -U    Set locking to non-strict.  Non-strict  locking  means
          that  the  owner of a file need not lock a revision for
          checkin.  This option should <i>not</i> be used for files that
          are  shared.   Whether  default  locking  is  strict is
          determined by your system administrator, but it is nor-
          mally strict.

     -m<i>rev</i>:<i>msg</i>
          Replace revision <i>rev</i>'s log message with <i>msg</i>.

     -M    Do not send mail when breaking somebody  else's  lock.
          This  option  is  not meant for casual use; it is meant
          for programs that warn users by other means, and invoke
          rcs -u only as a low-level lock-breaking operation.

RCS(1)                    User Commands                    RCS(1)

     -n<i>name</i>[:[<i>rev</i>]]
          Associate the symbolic name <i>name</i>  with  the  branch  or
          revision  <i>rev</i>.   Delete the symbolic name if both : and
          <i>rev</i> are omitted; otherwise, print an error  message  if
          <i>name</i> is already associated with another number.  If <i>rev</i>
          is symbolic, it is expanded before association.  A  <i>rev</i>
          consisting  of  a  branch number followed by a . stands
          for the current latest revision in  the  branch.   A  :
          with  an  empty <i>rev</i> stands for the current latest revi-
          sion on the default branch, normally  the  trunk.   For
          example,  rcs  - n<i>name</i>: RCS/*  associates <i>name</i> with the
          current latest revision of all  the  named  RCS  files;
          this contrasts with rcs -n<i>name</i>:$ RCS/* which associates
          <i>name</i> with the revision numbers extracted  from  keyword
          strings in the corresponding working files.

     -N<i>name</i>[:[<i>rev</i>]]
          Act like -n, except override any previous assignment of
          <i>name</i>.

     -o<i>range</i>
          deletes ("outdates") the revisions given by  <i>range</i>.   A
          range consisting of a single revision number means that
          revision.  A range consisting of a branch number  means
          the  latest  revision  on  that branch.  A range of the
          form <i>rev1</i>:<i>rev2</i> means revisions <i>rev1</i> to <i>rev2</i> on the same
          branch,  :<i>rev</i>  means  from  the beginning of the branch
          containing <i>rev</i> up to and including <i>rev</i>, and <i>rev</i>:  means
          from  revision  <i>rev</i> to the end of the branch containing
          <i>rev</i>.  None of the outdated revisions can have  branches
          or locks.

     -q    Run quietly; do not print diagnostics.

     -I    Run interactively, even if the standard input is not a
          terminal.

     -s<i>state</i>[:<i>rev</i>]
          Set the state attribute of the revision <i>rev</i>  to  <i>state</i>.
          If  <i>rev</i>  is a branch number, assume the latest revision
          on that branch.  If <i>rev</i> is omitted, assume  the  latest
          revision  on  the  default  branch.   Any identifier is
          acceptable for <i>state</i>.  A useful set of  states  is  Exp
          (for  experimental),  Stab  (for  stable), and Rel (for
          released).  By default, <a href="./man.cgi?ci+1">ci(1)</a> sets the state of a revi-
          sion to Exp.

     -t[<i>file</i>]
          Write descriptive text from the contents of  the  named
          <i>file</i>  into  the  RCS  file, deleting the existing text.
          The <i>file</i> pathname cannot begin with  - .   If  <i>file</i>  is
          omitted,   obtain   the   text   from  standard  input,

          terminated by end-of-file or by a line containing  . by
          itself.   Prompt  for the text if interaction is possi-
          ble; see -I.  With -i,  descriptive  text  is  obtained
          even if -t is not given.

     -t-<i>string</i>
          Write descriptive text from the  <i>string</i>  into  the  RCS
          file, deleting the existing text.

     -T    Preserve the modification time on the RCS file  unless
          a revision is removed.  This option can suppress exten-
          sive recompilation caused by a  <a href="./man.cgi?make+1">make(1)</a>  dependency  of
          some  copy  of  the  working file on the RCS file.  Use
          this option with care; it  can  suppress  recompilation
          even  when  it is needed, i.e. when a change to the RCS
          file would mean a change  to  keyword  strings  in  the
          working file.

     -V    Print RCS's version number.

     -V<i>n</i>   Emulate RCS version <i>n</i>.  See <a href="./man.cgi?co+1">co(1)</a> for details.

     -x<i>suffixes</i>
          Use <i>suffixes</i> to characterize RCS files.  See <a href="./man.cgi?ci+1">ci(1)</a>  for
          details.

     -z<i>zone</i>
          Use <i>zone</i> as the default time zone.  This option has  no
          effect;  it is present for compatibility with other RCS
          commands.

     At least one explicit option must be given, to ensure compa-
     tibility with future planned extensions to the rcs command.

<H3>COMPATIBILITY</H3>
     The -b<i>rev</i> option generates an RCS file that cannot be parsed
     by RCS version 3 or earlier.

     The -k<i>subst</i> options (except -kkv) generate an RCS file  that
     cannot be parsed by RCS version 4 or earlier.

     Use rcs -V<i>n</i> to make an RCS file acceptable to RCS version  <i>n</i>
     by discarding information that would confuse version <i>n</i>.

     RCS version 5.5 and earlier does not support the -x  option,
     and requires a ,v suffix on an RCS pathname.

<H3>FILES</H3>
     rcs accesses files much as <a href="./man.cgi?ci+1">ci(1)</a> does, except that  it  uses
     the  effective  user for all accesses, it does not write the
     working file or its directory, and it does not even read the
     working file unless a revision number of $ is specified.

<H3>BUGS</H3>
     A catastrophe (e.g. a system crash) can cause RCS  to  leave
     behind a semaphore file that causes later invocations of RCS
     to claim that the RCS file is in use.  To fix  this,  remove
     the  semaphore  file.   A  semaphore  file's  name typically
     begins with , or ends with _.

     The separator for revision ranges in the -o option  used  to
     be - instead of :, but this leads to confusion when symbolic
     names contain -.  For backwards compatibility rcs - o  still
     supports  the  old   -  separator,  but  it warns about this
     obsolete use.

     Symbolic names need  not  refer  to  existing  revisions  or
     branches.   For  example, the -o option does not remove sym-
     bolic names for the outdated revisions; you must use - n  to
     remove the names.
