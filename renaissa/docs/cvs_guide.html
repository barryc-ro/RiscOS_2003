<b>NAME</b><br>
<ul>cvs - Concurrent Versions System</ul>

<p>
<b>SYNOPSIS</b><br>
<ul><b>cvs</b> [ <i>cvs_options</i> ] <i>cvs_command</i> [ <i>command_options</i> ] [ <i>command_args</i> ]</ul>

<p>
<b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
<ul>
<b>cvs</b> is a front end to the rcs revision control system which extends the notion of revision control from a collection of files in a single directory to a hierarchical collection of directories consisting of revision controlled files.  These directories and files can be combined together to form a software release.  cvs provides the functions necessary to manage these software releases and to control the concurrent editing of source files among software developers.
<p>
<b>cvs</b> keeps a single copy of the master sources.  This copy is called the source &quot;repository&quot;; it contains all the information to permit extracting previous software releases at any time based on either a symbolic revision tag, or a date in the past.
</ul>

<p>
<b>GENERAL COMMANDS</b><br>
<ul>
<b>cvs</b> provides many commands (<i>cvs_command</i> in the synopsis), each of which has numerous options, however many of these commands will not need to be used so I will concentrate on the main set of commands.
For details of how to use the command, refer to the Command Summary.
<p>
<b>cvs checkout</b> <i>modules ...</i><br>
<ul>A necessary preliminary for most <b>cvs</b> work: creates your private copy of the source for modules (named collections of source; you can also use a path relative to the repository here).  You can work with this copy without interfering with others' work.  At least one subdirectory level is always created.</ul>
<p>
<b>cvs update</b><br>
<ul>Execute this command from within your private source directory when you wish to update your copies of the source files from changes that other developers have made to the source in the repository.</ul>
<p>
<b>cvs add</b> <i>file ...</i><br>
<ul>Use this command to enroll new files in <b>cvs</b> records of your working directory.  The files will be added to the repository the next time you run '<b>cvs commit</b>'.  Note: You should not use '<b>cvs add</b>' to bootstrap new sources into the source repository as '<b>cvs add</b>' is only used for new files in an already checked-out module.</ul>
<p>
<b>cvs commit</b> <i>file ...</i><br>
<ul>Use this command when you wish to &quot;publish&quot; your changes to other developers, by incorporating them in the source repository.</ul>
</ul>

<p>
<b>NON CVS COMMANDS</b><br>
<ul>
There are two commands to supplement the use of <b>cvs</b>, however it should be noted that these are not a native commands to <b>cvs</b>.
<p>
<b>cvsimport</b> <i>module</i><br>
<ul>This command is an enhancement over '<b>cvs import</b>' and should be invoked from the module directory when you wish to &quot;publish&quot; a new module into the repository.</ul>
<p>
<b>cvsbinaries</b> <i>module</i><br>
<ul>Use this command to inform <b>cvs</b> that there are binaries within the module.
</ul></ul>

<p>
<b>COMMAND SUMMARY</b><br>
<ul>

<b>checkout</b> [<b>options</b>] <i>modules ...</i><br>
<ul><b>checkout</b> will make a working directory containing copies of the source files specified by <i>modules</i>.  You must execute '<b>cvs checkout</b>' before using any of the cvs commands stated here.
<p>
Depending on the <i>modules</i> you specify, <b>checkout</b> may recursively create directories and populate them with the appropriate source files.  You can then edit these source files at any time (regardless of whether other developers are editing their own copies of the sources); update them to include new changes applied by others to the source repository; or commit your work as a permanent change to the repository.
<p>
Note that <b>checkout</b> is used to create directories.  The top-level directory created is always added to the directory where checkout is invoked, and usually has the same name as the specified <i>module</i>.  In the case of a <i>module</i> alias, the created sub-directory may have a different name, but you can be sure that it will be a sub-directory, and that <b>checkout</b> will show the relative path leading to each file as it is extracted into your private work area.
<p>
The <b>checkout</b> command will automatically get files from the trunk (see the section about revision numbers and branches) unless another branch is specified by using the <b>-r</b> option.  <b>checkout</b> is the only command which needs to know from which branch sources should be taken from.  The branch can be identified by either the branch number or as a symbolic tag to a branch number.
<p>
<ul><b>example% cvs checkout -r Ursula RiscOS/Sources/FileSys/CDFS</b></ul></ul>
<p>

<b>update</b> [<b>-AdflPpQqR</b>] [<b>-d</b>] [<b>-r</b> <i>tag</i> | <b>-D</b> <i>date</i>] <i>files ...</i><br>
<ul>After you've run <b>checkout</b> to create your private copy of source from the common repository, other developers will continue changing the central source.  You can use the <b>update</b> command from within your working directory to reconcile your work with any revisions applied to the source repository since your last checkout or update.
<p>
<b>cvs</b> update keeps you informed of it's progress by printing a line for each file, prefaced with one of the characters '<b> U A R M C ? </b>' to indicate the status of the file:
<p>

The file is <i>modified</i> in your working directory.  '<b>M</b>' can indicate one or two states for a file that you're working on: either there were no modifications to the same file in the repository, so that your file remains as you last saw it; or there were modifications in the repository as well as in your copy, but they were <i>merged</i> successfully, without conflict, in your working directory.<p>

(Note that some systems automatically purge files that begin with '<i>.#</i>' if they have not been accessed for a few days.  If you intend to keep a copy of your original file, it is a very good idea to rename it.)<p>

<p>
Running <b>update</b> with the <b>-nq</b> options (<i>cvs_options</i> in the synopsis) will inform you what would happen if update was executed.
<p>
<ul><b>example% cd RiscOS/Sources/Video<br>
example% cvs -nq update</b></ul>
</ul>
<p>

<b>add</b> [<b>-m</b> '<i>message</i>'] <i>files ...</i><br>
<ul>Use the <b>add</b> command to create a new file or directory in the repository.  The files or directories specified with add must already exist in the current directory (which must have been created with the <b>checkout</b> command).  To add a whole new directory hierarchy to the source repository, use the '<b>cvsimport</b>' command instead.
<p>
When all is well, an editor is invoked to allow you to enter a log message that will be written to the repository file.  You can instead specify the log message on the command line with the <b>-m</b> option, thus suppressing the editor.
<p>
The added files are not placed in the repository until you use '<b>cvs commit</b>' to make the change permanent.
<p>
<ul><b>example% mkdir new_directory<br>
example% cvs add new_directory</b></ul>
If you are committing a binary file (ie. a sprite file, or an executable which there are no sources for; or cannot be built again) then you must specify the <b>-kb</b> option as <b>cvs</b> handles binary files differently to plain source files.  Note: If the sources are being placed into <b>cvs</b> then ensure that there are no object, nor executable files within the module itself.
<ul><b>example% cvs add -kb !Sprites</b></ul>
</ul>
<p>

<b>commit</b> [<b>-lR</b>] [<b>-m</b> '<i>log_message</i>' | <b>-f</b> <i>file</i> ] [<b>-r</b> <i>revision</i>] [<i>files ...</i>]<br>
<ul>Use '<b>cvs commit</b>' when you want to incorporate changes from your working source files into the repository.
<p>
If you don't specify particular <i>files</i> to commit, all of the files in your working directory are examined.  <b>commit</b> will change in the repository only those files that you have really changed.  By default (or if you explicitly specify the <b>-R</b> option), files in sub-directories are also examined and committed if they have changed; you can use the <b>-l</b> option (<i>cvs_options</i> in the synopsis) to limit commit to the current directory only.  Sometimes you may want to force a file to be committed even though it is unchanged; this is achieved with the <b>-f</b> flag, which also has the effect of disabling recursion (which can be enabled using <b>-R</b>).
<p>
When all is well, an editor is invoked to allow you to enter a log message that will be written to the repository file.  You can instead specify the log message on the command line with the <b>-m</b> option, thus suppressing the editor (it is also possible to use the <b>-F</b> option to specify that the argument <i>file</i> contains the log message).
<p>
<ul><b>example% cvs commit RiscOS/Sources/Apps/Edit/c/edit</b></ul>
</ul>
<p>

<b>cvsimport</b> <i>module revision tag</i><br>
<ul>Use the <b>cvsimport</b> command to create a new hierarchy in the repository.  The command will recursively import all the files in the current working directory onto the branch specified.  A tag name of initial is advised for consistency.  To add single files in an already checked out module, use the '<b>cvs add</b>' command instead.
<p>
The files are added immediately to the repository.
<p>
<ul><b>example% cvsimport RiscOS/Sources/Kernel Ursula initial</b></ul>
</ul>

<b>cvsbinaries</b> [<b>-test</b>] <i>module</i><br>
<ul>Use the <b>cvsbinaries</b> command to inform <b>cvs</b> that there are binaries (such as sprite files) within the module.  This is important as <b>cvs</b> handles binary files differently to standard text files.  The command should be executed on a checked out version of the module.<p>
If a binary file is being added to an already present module, then the <b>add -kb</b> command should be used instead.<p>
The <b>-test</b> flag will print to the screen what the <b>cvsbinaries</b> script will do.
<p>
<ul><b>example% cvsbinaries RiscOS/Sources/Desktop/Wimp<br>
example% cvsbinaries -test RiscOS/Sources/Desktop/Wimp</b></ul>
</ul></ul>

<p>
<b>REVISION NUMBERS AND BRANCHES</b><br>
<ul>
Each version of a file has a unique revision number.  Revision numbers look like '1.1', '1.2', '1.3.2.2' or even '1.3.2.2.4.5'.  A revision number always has an even number of period-separated decimal integers.  By default revision 1.1 is the first revision of a file.  Each successive revision is given a new number by increasing the rightmost number by one.  The following figure displays a few revisions, with newer revisions to the right.
<p>
<center><img src="pics/figure1.gif" alt="Figure 1"></center>
<p>
<b>cvs</b> is not limited to linear development.  The revision tree can be split into branches where each branch is a self-maintained line of development.  Changes made on one branch can easily be moved back to the main trunk.
<p>
Each branch has a branch number, consisting of an odd number of period-separated decimal integers.  The branch number is created by appending an integer to the revision number where the corresponding branch is forked off.  Having branch numbers allows more than one branch to be forked off from a certain revision.
<p>
All revisions on a branch have revision numbers formed by appending an ordinal number to the branch number.  The following figure illustrates branching with an example.
<p>
<center><img src="pics/figure2.gif" alt="Figure 2"></center>
</ul>

<p>
<b>SYMBOLIC TAGS</b>
<ul>
A symbolic tag is a name given to either a revision number or a branch number to easily identify it.  For example, Ursula, Daytona, Spinner are all symbolic tags for their respective branches.
</ul>

<p>
<b>TAGGING AND PRIVATE BRANCHES</b>
<ul>
When a module is added or modified in <b>cvs</b>, it is a good idea to assign a symbolic tag to that particular version so it is possible to checkout that particular version in the future if needed.  Typically the symbolic tags should follow the form:<br>
<ul><b>username_component-majorversion_minorversion</b></ul><br>
To assign a symbolic tag to a module, you must have that module in your private sources.  Read the sections about <b>checkout</b> and <b>update</b> to
find out how to create a private copy.
<p>
<b>tag</b> [<b>-lR</b>] [<b>-b</b>] <i>symbolic_tag</i> [<i>files ...</i>]
<ul>Executing the <b>tag</b> command will add a symbolic tag to the files you
specifiy, or will assign tags to all files within the current directory if
no files are specified.<br>
The command can also be used to delete a symbolic tag, or to create a branch.  See the options section below.<br>
If you attempt to use a tag name that already exists, <b>cvs</b> will complain and not overwrite that tag.  Use the <b>-F</b> option to force the new tag value.

It is sometimes handy when you are working on a module, especially one which may take several days of development, to create your own development branch and commit to that instead of the normal branch.  his means that you have a backup of the sources incase of a potential problem, but it is sheltered away from other people so, for example, an unfinished module does not get included in a build.  Once development has finished on the development branch, the alterations to the module can be merged into what is already on the main branch.  This also takes into account changes that other people may have made to the module.
<p>
To create your own development branch, you must have the module checked out in your private sources.  Follow the same instructions as <b>tag</b> but use the <b>-b</b> option to create a branch tag.  Once the branch tag has been created, you must re-tag the branch without the <b>-b</b> option and with <b>_dev_bp</b> appended to the symbolic tag name to make it into a branch pointer.
<ul><b>example% cvs tag -b rthornb_mymodule-2_13<br>
example% cvs tag rthornb_mymodule-2_13_dev_bp<br>
</b></ul>
You can then use <b>cvs</b> as normal, but when committing sources back, specify your development branch in the <b>-r</b> option.
<ul><b>example% cvs commit -r rthornb_mymodule-2_13 c/foo<br></b></ul>
When development has finished, the branch must be merged back into the main
branch so that other developers can access your modifications.  To do this, you must checkout a fresh copy of the module from the main branch and set the working directory to be the top level directory of this module.  The <b>update</b> command must then be invoked with the <b>-j</b> option specifying the development branch name.
<ul><b>example% cvs checkout -r Ursula RiscOS/Sources/Test/mymodule<br>
example% cd RiscOS/Sources/Test/mymodule<br>
example% cvs update -j rthornb_mymodule-2_13<br>
</b></ul>
The usual <b>update</b> output information will be printed to the screen (unless the <b>-q</b> option has been specified) and you must fix any conflicts before proceeding any further.
<p>
The <b>update</b> command will examine the differences between the version on the development branch and the version on the main branch, modifying the private copy of the main branch sources with any changes.  When the sources have been updated without any conflicts, you must then commit the sources back to the main branch of <b>cvs</b>.  The development branch will no longer exist, and all the modifications will be back on the main branch for other developers to work with.
