<h2> <a name="overview">Overview </a> </h2>
<p>
This workpackage is a result of discussions held on 1st August 1997 regarding the CVS implementation and source control.

<h2> <a name="outstanding">Outstanding issues </a> </h2>
<p>
Items highlighted <em>like this</em> are subject to discussion and or change.
<p>

<h2> <a name="background">Background </a> </h2>
<p>
With the move to allowing concurrent software development there is an increasing need for individual engineers to be automatically informed when others make changes to particular sources in the repository. We have always had the ability for "build masters" to be informed when commits have been made to the repository. This however has been on a global scale ie, any source on any branch within a given repository. Adding and removing users from this notification list was also a little involved requiring insider information on our CVS implementation.
<p>
There is a requirement therefore to have a facility to allow individual users to add/remove themselves to/from a notification list. They would be allowed to specify which branch and which directory structure they wanted notification for. This would allow the spread of knowledge to those interested whenever a bug was fixed or a feature added to a particular module. Build masters would also use this notification mechanism to keep themselves informed of changes to the build within their area of responsibility. They should also be responsible for picking up on other changes which may be advantagous to them.
<p>

<h2> <a name="implementation">Implementation</a></h2>
<p>
A script will be written that allows a user to investigate and modify their own notification details. This script will be called <em>srcnotify</em>.
<p>
There will be a noddy interface to the commit script allowing inexperienced users to be prompted for the correct entries. There will also be a more advanced interface allowing command line flags that would be quicker for those "who know what they are doing"&reg;.
<p>
The <code>srcnotify</code> script will have the following forms, the user will be picked up as the current logged in user :
<p>
<center>
<table border="1" width="80%">
<tr> <th> Command <th> Description
<tr> <td> <code>srcnotify</code> <td> List all current notifications.
<tr> <td> <code>srcnotify add</code> <td> Add a notification.
<tr> <td> <code>srcnotify remove</code> <td> Remove a notification.
</table>
</center>
<p>
For <code>srcnotify remove</code>, all the current notifications will be listed with a identifier associated with each. The user will be prompted to enter a number to identify the notification to be removed.

<p>
The following parameters can be specified for <code>srcnotify add</code> :
<p>
<center>
<table border="1">
<tr> <th> Parameter <th> Default <th> Flag <th> Description
<tr> <td> Options   <td> None   <td align="center"> -q <td> Quiet operation, don't prompt for user input.
<tr> <td> Directory <td> Current directory <td align="center"> -d <td> Notify the user whenever commits are applied to any file in this directory and any directories below it.
<tr> <td> Branch    <td> Trunk <td align="center"> -r <td> Restrict the notification to changes that are applied to any file in the specified directory only on this branch.
</table>
</center>
If no flags are not present, the user will be prompted to enter values for directory and branch, default responsed will also be presented.
<p>


<h2> <a name="timescales">Timescales</a></h2>
<p>
The timescales for implementing the <em>srcnotify</em> script is approximately 2 days.
