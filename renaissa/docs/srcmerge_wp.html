<h2> <a name="overview" href="#contents">Overview </a> </h2>
<p>
This work-package is a result of discussions held on 1st August 1997 regarding
the CVS implementation and source control.

<h2> <a name="background" href="#contents">Background </a> </h2>
<p>
When two lines of development diverge, it is usually useful to merge
them back together again.  This means that the main line of
development will be updated with the changes that were applied on the
other line.  Although CVS handles merging to a certain extent, there
are some cases which it handles badly.  In particular, it cannot deal
with binary files, even if the files do not need merging.
<p>
In the following discussion, some conventions will be used.  The main
line of development will be known as the trunk (which will usually be
the CVS trunk, but may not be).  The other line of development will be
known as the branch.  The most recent version of a file which both the
trunk revision (most recent revision on the trunk), and branch
revision are up-to-date with respect to will be known as the ancestor.
The merge process will take the changes between the ancestor and the
branch revision, and apply those changes to the trunk.

<h3> Possible merge scenarios </h3>
<p>
There are several possibilities for each file when a merge occurs,
considering that in each direction the file may be modified, created,
deleted or left unchanged.

</table>
The only files we are interested in are the files which are different
between the branch and the trunk.

<h3>Merge assistance tools</h3>
<p>
<em>It may be possible to extend the script to help merging of binary
files such as sprite files using other tools.  I think that creation
of such tools could be an ongoing job, and not covered by this work
package, but the script should be able to support them.</em>

<h2> <a name="implementation" href="#contents">Implementation</a></h2>
<p>
A wrapper script will be written that allows the CVS operations
involved in merging to be carried out with as little user-intervention
as possible.  This wrapper script will be called <em>srcmerge</em>.
<p>
This script does not need a Noddy interface, as only people who "know
what they are doing" &reg; should be using it.  The script will be
allowed to enter vi for no apparent reason to scare off the woosies.

<h3> Tagging </h3>
<p>
In general, the ancestor is not the base revision of the branch.
Although for the first merge, this will be the case, subsequent merges
will use the branch revision of the previous merge as the ancestor.  A
tag therefore needs to be on the next ancestor to use.  In order for
different subdirectories to be merged at different stages, each branch
should have a single tag name for the ancestor, which gets updated as
the changes are applied to the trunk.  While the merge is in progress,
work may still be done on the branch, so a tag should be applied to
the files for the duration of the merge, or information should be
stored in the working directory.  <em>For a branch called Project, the
following tags may be used.</em>

<table border>
  <tr><td><b>Tag</b><td><b>Description</b>
  <tr><td>Project<td>Branch tag
  <tr><td><em>Project_bp</em><td>The ancestor to use for a merge.
  <tr><td><em>Project_fold</em><td>The branch revision used by the
	  merge.
  <tr><td><em>Project_6Aug97</em>
      <td>The ancestor used by the merge on 6 August 1997
</table>

<h3> The merge process </h3>
<p>
To perform a merge, a checked-out copy of the trunk will need to be
available.  At the start of the merge, <em>the branch revision will be
tagged, or marked in some way</em>, so that further commits along the
branch will not affect the merge process.  The working directory will
then be modified to contain the merged version of the sources.  At the
end of the process the sources will be committed.  If a large merge is
taking place, a number of conflicts are likely to occur.  If the
script does find conflicts, it should continue the merge but not
commit the changes, and present the conflicts to the user.  It will
then be up to the user to run the script again, after the conflicts
have been resolved.  It is possible that the user did not resolve all
the conflicts, so the script should cope with being run several times,
and will continue where it left off each time.  It will need to have
some way of identifying outstanding conflicts.  If a working directory
is deleted while a merge is taking place, the script should act as if
the merge had never happened, to the best of it's ability.

<p>
<em>When the script is invoked, it will check the current directory
for a merge in progress.  If there a merge is in progress, it will
check the command line parameters against the merge, and continue the
merge.  If there is no merge, a new merge will be started. </em> If
the merge completes successfully, the sources will then be committed.

<p>
Starting a merge involves the following steps.
<ul>
  <li><em>The user</em> checks out the trunk.
  <li>The script <em>takes note of branch revision number.</em>
  <li>The script <em>takes note of the ancestor revision number.</em>
  <li>The checked out files are merged by the script.
  <li>Any conflicts are reported to the user.
</ul>

<p>
Continuing a merge involves the following steps.
<ul>
  <li>Conflicts are checked by the script.
  <li>Changes are committed by the script.
  <li>The script will tag the ancestor revision, for reference.
  <li>The ancestor tag is moved to the branch revision
</ul>

<h3> Command line options </h3>
<em>The script will use the following command line options:</em>
<table border>
  <tr><td><b>Option</b><td><b>Meaning</b>
  <tr><td><code>-r&nbsp;revision</code>
      <td>Specifies the branch revision to use.  This will be a 
          CVS tag (in most cases).
  <tr><td><code>-a&nbsp;revision</code>
      <td>Specifies the ancestor revision to use.  This will be a
          CVS tag (in most cases).
  <tr><td><code>-A</code>
      <td>The instructs the script to determine the ancestor revision
	  from the branch revision number.
  <tr><td><code>-n</code>
      <td>Does not commit the source files after merging.

<h2> <a name="timescales" href="#contents">Time-scales</a></h2>
<p>
The time-scales for implementing the <em>srcmerge</em> script are
approximately 5 days.
