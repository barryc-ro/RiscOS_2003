<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

This information is intended to provide a guideline as to how all
software engineers should record change information when committing
updated sources to a source repository. It is intended to be brief but
contain all required information.


<h2>2. Components</h2>

A source component can be a module, application or whatever. It is a
unit of software which can have a version number associated with it.


<h2>3. Responsibility</h2>

It is the responsibility of the elected build master to enforce these
rules regarding log messages. If gentle persuasion is not sufficient,
project manager assistance should be sought.


<h2>4. Log content</h2>

Log messages should be split into three sections, summary, detail,
admin. These will be discussed below. Only the Admin section is
compulsory but the others should contain at least the headings with no
content to indicate explicitly that no information was provided.


<h3>4.1 Summary</h3>

Bullet point changes to the component. This includes :
<ul>
<li>features added
<li>features removed
<li>faults fixed - including fault report IDs
<li>ECOs actioned - including ECO IDs
<li>any known problems with this component, features missing or
    inter operability issues.
</ul>
This information is primarily for the use of build masters when
compiling a log of changes in a build and for testers, not concerned
with implementation details.


<h3>4.2 Detail</h3>

If appropriate a more detailed description of the changes taken place
within the source should be given. This should not be detailed diffs as
these are easily available elsewhere. This includes :
<ul>
<li>source files added/removed
<li>details of any major code restructuring
<li>details of any major workspace restructuring e.g. now uses dynamic
memory allocation rather than stack space
<li>makefile modifications
<li>(component status attribute - see below *1)
</ul>

<h3>4.3 Admin</h3>

This is a compulsory section which should be entirely automated by the
source control system being used. This includes :
<ul>
<li>username of engineer making change
<li>date change was committed
<li>externally visible version number of component, what it will be
once the commit has taken place
<li>name of tag/identifier used to retrieve this version from the 
    repository
</ul>

<h3>4.4 Example</h3>

The following example shows the use of this log format.
<blockquote>
<pre>
Summary:
    More bugfixes sent by David Pilling.
Detail:
    fx.c, setextent() : changed condition for setting modified bit.
Admin:
    Sources compiled.
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>Notes</h2>

*1 If the level of testing can be distilled to a number of set states
e.g. Compiled, Stand alone tested, System tested, Audited, etc. ... It
would be possible to move this attribute to the Admin section and
automatically prompt the engineer for a choice from a list of legal
values. This however raises the problem of the correct course of action
when something has changed state. The log file would say the component
is at one state and it now at another - do we 
<ol type="a">
<li>change the log file which would be messy
<li>leave out the status attribute from the log file altogether and
   implement it using source control tags which can be applied without
   modification to a components sources/history. 
</ul>
I would prefer the later solution (b).
