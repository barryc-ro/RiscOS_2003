<h2> <a name="overview" href="#contents">Overview </a> </h2>
<p>
This workpackage is a result of build nightmares encountered by Neil and
myself during the recent NC projects. Comments and suggestions are welcome,
especially from people who know the build process.

<h2> <a name="outstanding" href="#contents">Outstanding issues </a> </h2>
<p>
Items highlighted <em>like this</em> are subject to discussion and or change.
<p>

<h2> <a name="background" href="#contents">Background </a> </h2>
<p>
The current RISC OS ROM build process relies on the following  :
<ul>
<li> <b>!Env</b> - establish hardware and software targets, image size,
locale and keyboard.
<li> <b>BuildSys</b> - components file, "what goes in the ROM" plus a load of
awk and taskobey scripts (eg !MkRom).
<li> <b>Make</b> - the overall build process is run via make.
</ul>
<p> The build process currently follows the pattern given below.
<ol>
<li> Run the appropriate <b>!Env</b> file.
<li> Edit the <b>Components</b> file with your BuildSys directory.
<li> Run <b>!Config</b>, which runs make which runs awk to produce the files
  <ol type="a">
    <li> <b>Makefile</b> - top level ROM makefile
    <li> <b>ROMImage.ForBigSplt</b> - data used by BigSplit to glue a ROM together
    <li> <b>ROMImage.Makefile</b> - makefile for the module link phase
  </ol>
<li> Invoke the appropriate build via a taskobey eg <b>!MkNewRes</b>.
</ol>
<p>
The following observations can be drawn from this process.
<ul>
<li> About 95% of the information contained in the !Env files is common
across all builds (paths, aliases,etc). This has recently been tidied up such
that all core information is sourced from a common file !Common.

<li> Many of the files contained in the BuildSys directories are static and
could be shared across all builds.

<li> The process of generating a log file is not automated or forced.

<li> The process of naming/versioning a final image is not automated.

<li> It is very difficult to pass down flags or options to a module to modify
its behaviour. eg telephone number to put in ROM.

<li> The BigSplit program is written in basic and requires a large DIM to
contain the entire ROM image. This is not practical for 8Mb+ image sizes.
This has recently been fixed by re-writing it in C (BigSplit2).

<li> It is often easy to modify the components file and forget to run
!Config, resulting in an image not reflecting the components file.

<li> A large percentage of information contained in the components file is
duplicated across every build (location of module within the build tree,
location of final module image, module type). If any of this information was
to change, the same change would have to be made in numerous different
places.

<li> awk under RISC OS is not 100% stable with execution aborts often
occurring.

</ul>

<h2> <a name="implementation" href="#contents">Implementation</a></h2>
<p>
<h3> Language </h3>
<p>
It has been decided that make is not flexible enough to act as a top level
build orchestrator. Ideally a replacement would be written in perl but there
is some concern over the reliability of RISC OS perl. The compromise solution
is to write an application in C (written with portability in mind) which will
perform the top level build scheduling required. Such an application should be
able to address many of the points covered above.
<p>
<h3> Log files </h3>
<p>
Log files will be automatically generated and saved for each build. The
filename for these files will be given by an entry in the components file.
This may be an environment variable that has been assigned a value by another
program/script.
<p>
<h3> Final images </h3>
<p>
The final image will be named using another name specified in the components
file. This may or may not be the same as the log filename. Again, environment
variables will be used, allowing another program/script to generate them. 
<p>
<h3> Dependancies </h3>
<p>
When options are passed down to a module that change the build of that module,
care has to be taken that dependancies are dealt with correctly. For example,
in changing an option to a module you may intend a particular flavour of that
module. But due to none of the source files having changed, make will not force
a re-build giving you the module that was built before the options were changed.
<p>
This problem will be overcome by specifying what things should force a clean
build when they have changed. For example, specifying <code>Machine</code> will 
force a clean build if the <code>&lt;Machine&gt;</code> environment variable 
changes. (<code>Machine</code> is looked up as an environment variable, if it
exists, its value is used, otherwise <code>Machine</code> is used.
Secondly, a clean build should be forced whenever the options change.
<p>
<h3> Components </h3>
<p>
Since much of the information in the components file is common across all
builds, make it common. A single file will therefore be kept in a central
place providing a lookup from module name to path and type (C/Asm). This 
will be called the <b>Components Database</b> and have the following file
format :
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
# lines starting with the '#' character will be treated as 
# comments and ignored.
&lt;module build name&gt; &lt;type&gt; &lt;source path&gt; &lt;output path&gt; &lt;filename&gt; &lt;switch&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
These items need a little expansion therefore:
<p>
<table border=1>
<tr><th>item<th>description
<tr><td valign="top"><code>&lt;module&nbsp;build&nbsp;name&gt;</code>
    <td>This is a unique module name used throughout the build process. 
        <br>eg WindowManager in preference to Wimp.

<tr><td valign="top"><code>&lt;type&gt;</code>
    <td>eg <code>EXP, C, ASM, RES, BAS, KERNEL</code>, the same as in the old world.

<tr><td valign="top"><code>&lt;source&nbsp;path&gt;</code>
    <td>Directory containing the module sources.
	<br>eg Desktop.Wimp

<tr><td valign="top"><code>&lt;output&nbsp;path&gt;</code>
    <td>Which directory to place the resultant module as RISC OS doesn't like
        more than 77 files/directory. Directories are prefixed with the environment
        variable <code>&lt;Build&gt;</code>.
        <br>eg HWSupport

<tr><td valign="top"><code>&lt;filename&gt;</code>.
    <td>The name of the module used as input to the BigSplit process.

<tr><td valign="top"><code>&lt;switch&gt;</code>
    <td>This is used by the build process to decide whether a make clean is
        required as described above. Items will be interpreted as environment variables
	if they exist and plain text otherwise.
</table>
<p>
This component database will be validated for syntax and clashes, each time it is used.
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
# Example entry for the FileCore module.
FileCore  FileSys.FileCore  OS_Core FileCore  ASM  

# Another for NVRAM module
NVRAM     HWSupport.NVRAM   NCOS    NVRAM     C    System
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The build specific components file will then consist of a list of modules
along with any options that should be passed down to the build of that
module. This file will be read in directly by the srcbuild application
therefore require no pre-processing before it can be used. 
<p>
The ability to include other component files will be allowed in order for a
core build to be used as a baseline for actual products which can add or
remove modules as requred. This would also allow baseline module options to be
overridden by new options. In addition, some parameters as specified in the
components database can be overridden by the components file.
<p>
The format of the build specific components file (taking into consideration
the points above) will therefore be as follows :
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
# lines starting with the '#' character will be treated as 
# comments and ignored.

# zero or more include lines, each successive include, overriding previous info
%include &lt;file to include&gt;

# compulsory log and image filenames (may be environment variables)
%log           &lt;log filename&gt;
%image         &lt;image filename&gt;
%messages      &lt;location of messages module&gt;
%joiner        &lt;application to glue a ROM together&gt;
%joinerformat  &lt;the format used by joiner application&gt;

# optional signatures
%sigstr        &lt;four character sequence to appear in ROM eg NCOS&gt;
%signum	       &lt;for hext digit sequence to appear in ROM&gt;

# optional parameters for podule builds
%poduleproduct     &lt;value&gt;
%poduledescription &lt;value&gt;
%poduleserial      &lt;value&gt;
%podulestatus      &lt;value&gt;
%podulemanufacture &lt;value&gt;
%podulepart        &lt;value&gt;
%poduledate        &lt;value&gt;
  
# one or more modules to include in the ROM. These may override previous parameters
&lt;module build name&gt; [-type &lt;type&gt;] [-switch &lt;switch&gt;] [-options &lt;module options&gt;] 

# we want to remove a module from a previously included list
-&lt;module build name&gt;

# we want to add a module after another module
&lt;module build name&gt;:&lt;another module build name&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
srcbuild will also maintain a shadow components file. This is an
auto-generated file containing information on modules that have "switch on"
parameters or "options". It records any module options passed to the module
build and an expansion of any parameters specified as build switches. A clean
make is forced if either of the following cases is true :

<p> 
<ul>
  <li> shadow file does not exist and module has options/"switch on's"
  <li> module cannot be found in the shadow file and has options/"switch on's"
  <li> options and/or switch parameters have changed from values in shadow file
</ul>

<p>
<h3> Invoking a build </h3>
<p>
The !Env file sets enough environment variables to be able to deduce the
build target and hence the components file to be used. The build phases will
be invoked by passing parameters to the srcbuild application. These will be
executed in order of appearance on the command line. The following build
phases are supported.
<p>
<center>
<table border="1">
<tr><th>Phase       <th>Action<th>Item type<th>Extras
<tr><td>list        <td>list items
    <td>All<td>Type and Switches and Options  displayed.
<tr><td>clean       <td><code>make clean</code>            
    <td>ASM, C, BAS and KERNEL<td>Libraries not fully cleaned.
<tr><td>export_hdrs <td><code>make export PHASE=hdrs</code>
    <td>ASM, C, BAS, KERNEL and EXP<td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>export_libs <td><code>make export PHASE=libs</code>

<tr><td rowspan="2">install_rom <td><code>make rom_link</code>    
    <td>C<td>Performs final link phase
<tr>                            <td><code>make install_rom</code> 
    <td>ASM, BAS and KERNEL <td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>join        <td>run joiner application
    <td>ASM, C, BAS and KERNEL <td>Uses appropriate file format.
</table>

<p>
The srcbuild application will process modules in the order they are specified
in the components file (with the exception of an additional module inserted
after another).
<p>
Whenever possible, errors will not stop the execution of a particular build
phase. Errors will be recorded and batched up for display at the end of the
phase.
<p>


<h2> <a name="timescales" href="#contents">Timescales</a></h2>
<p>
The timescales for implementing the <em>srcbuild</em> application are approximately 5 days.
