<h2> <a name="overview">Overview </a> </h2>
<p>
This workpackage is a result of discussions held on 1st August 1997 regarding the CVS implementation and source control.

<h2> <a name="background">Background </a> </h2>
<p>
Vanilla CVS does not understand the concept of RISC OS version numbers. It has its own version numbering convention and this does not fit in well with the RISC OS view of the world. This presents a number of problems :
<ul>
<li> Module version numbers can be incremented on different branches creating conflicts of version number.
<li> It can not be guarenteed that a particular version number contains all the features it should.
<li> It is virtually impossible to retrieve all the source files that make up a particular version of a module.
</ul>

<h3> RISC OS version numbers </h3>
<p>
RISC OS uses the version numbering convention <code>x.yy</code> where <code>yy</code> is incremented with each change to the source and <code>x</code> incremented at some other time. This version number is held in the module help text which is formatted as follows :
<blockquote>
<pre>
module_name TAB[TAB] v.vv (DD MMM YYYY)
</pre>
</blockquote>
The RISC OS version number is the version number of the module rather than the version number of a source code file.

<h3> CVS version numbers </h3>
<p>
Under CVS each version of a file has a unique revision number. Revision numbers are an even number of '.' separated integers and look like <code>1.2</code> or <code>1.3</code>. For each modification of a file, the revision number is incremented. Since CVS allows non-linear development on branches, the revision number is used to identify the branch. The branch number is an odd number of '.' separated integers constructed by appending an integer to the revision number where the branch was taken. An example branch number would be <code>1.2.2</code>.
<p>

<h3> Solution/compromise </h3>
<p>
The very workings of CVS rely on the revision number scheme described above. In addition the workings of the RISC OS kernel require the RISC OS version numbers. There is a need to satisfy the following requirements :
<ul>
<li> Increment the RISC OS number in an automated manner, but under user request. The RISC OS version number will be called the <b>major</b> version number.
<li> Whenever the major version number is not incremented, a <b>minor</b> version number will be auto incremented.
<li> The minor version number will be based on the branch number to allow interested parties to determine where the sources can be found.
<li> Sources within the repository will be automatically tagged allowing retrieval of the exact source given the major and minor version numbers.
<li> Both the major and minor version numbers will be available to module writted in C and assembler via an inclusion mechanism.
<li> The major version number is already available as part of the module help text. The minor version number will be appended to this help text in the area currently allowed to be freely formatted.
</ul>
<p>

<h2> <a name="implementation">Implementation</a></h2>
<p>
A wrapper script will be written that allows the cvs commit to be performed with a number of additional actions. The real cvs commit will be disabled, allowing only one route to committing sources. This wrapper script will be called <em>srccommit</em>.
<p>
There will be a noddy interface to the commit script allowing inexperienced users to be prompted for the correct entries during the commit process. If possible we will even try to remove the need to enter vi as it scares some woosies. There will always be a more advanced interface allowing command line flags that would easy batch operation and be quicker for those who know what they are doing.
<p>
<ol>
<li> When performing srccommit, the script will look for a file <code><b>VersionNum</b></code> in the modules root directory. <p><em>We may need to reference a list of modules to find this directory, for example doing a commit in a source directory. eg RiscOS/Sources/Kernel/s/PMF needs to be resolved to RiscOS/Sources/Kernel. We could look for Makefiles moving up the directory structure until we find them.</em><p>
<li> If the file <code>VersionNum</code> <b>is not</b> found, it will be created. A sensible guess will be made to determine if the module is C or Assembler and an initial major and minor version number will be written into the file. The user will be informed that this file has been created and that they should make use of it within their module build. The commit will be aborted at this point.
<li> If the file <code>VersionNum</code> <b>does</b> exist, it will be read. If the commit is taking place on the trunk, the user will be prompted as to whether the major version number should be incremented.
<li> If the major number is to be incremented, the new major version number is written out to the <code>VersionNum</code> file. If not, the minor version number is incremented and written out.
<li> If the commit is taking place on a branch only the minor version number is allowed to be incremented. This is done with the number being prefixed by the branch number to allow differienciation.
<li> The user will be prompted to enter a change log entry. A combination of the major and minor version numbers will be included within this log entry automatically. This text entry may be done without the use of vi.
<li> All the sources within the module directory are cvs tagged with a combination of major and minor version numbers.
<li> The user is informed of a successful commit and the new version numbers associated with the module.
<li> The mechanisms for informing others of repository changes and allowing access control will be supported.
</ol>

<p>
The following command line flags will be allowed for users who "know what they are doing"&reg;
<p>
<center>
<table border="0">
<tr> <th> Flag <th> Description
<tr> <td> <code>-q</code> <td> quiet operation, don't report status etc.
<tr> <td> <code>-m &lt;message&gt; </code> <td> place <code>&lt;message&gt;</code> in the change log and don't prompt for any manual entry.
<tr> <td> <code>-major</code> <td> increment the major version number.
</table>

<h2> <a name="timescales">Timescales</a></h2>
<p>
The timescales for implementing the <em>srccommit</em> script are approximately 3 days.
