<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
<code>srccommit</code> provides a wrapper to the <code>cvs commit</code> command. It has the ability to automatically maintain RISC OS module version numbers and provide uniqueness between modules along a branch. In addition, a single log entry will be associated with all the files changed within the module and sources are conveniently tagged with a unique identifier.

<p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
srccommit [-h] [-m message] 
</pre>
</blockquote>
<center>
<table border="1">
<tr><th> Parameter <th>Flag <th> Description
<tr><td> Message   <td align="center">-m <td> Specify log entry message on the command line rather than via an editor.
<tr><td> Help	   <td align="center">-h <td> Display usage help.
</table>
</center>
<p>
When invoked <code>srccommit</code> will look for a file <code>VersionNum</code> in the current working directory.
<p>
<h3>VersionNum file not present</h3>
<p>
The following actions are performed if the <code>VersionNum</code> is not present.
<ol>
<li> User is asked if a new file should be created, commit is aborted if it is not to be created.
<li> User is asked if an assembler version should be created aswell.
<li> An initial version number is presented which can be accepted or modified by the user.
<li> A <code>VersionNum</code> file and optionally a <code>VersionASM</code> file is created and added to the repository. If this is being performed on a branch the minor version number will be set to the cvs file revision number.
</ol>

<h3>VersionNum file present</h3>
<ol>
<li> The <code>VersionNum</code> file is read and the major module number is extracted.
<li> If working on the trunk, the user will be prompted for the major version number to be incremented. If on a branch, the minor version number will be automatically incremented.
<li> The user is prompted for a log entry to cover changes. The entry can be entered directly or via the configured editor (environment variable EDITOR). Alternativly the entry can be passed in via the <code>-m</code> flag.
<li> The sources are committed using the supplied log entry.
<li> If the major or minor version numbers have changed, the sources are tagged with a tag, constructed using the module name, major and minor version numbers.
</ol>
<p>
<h2>File formats</h2>
<p>
The following is the format of the <code>VersionNum</code> file. It is constructed such that it can be included into C code and cmhg header files.
<blockquote>
<pre>
/* (0.07)
 *
 * This file is automatically maintained by srccommit, do not edit manually.
 *
 */
#define Module_MajorVersion_CMHG     	0.07
#define Module_MinorVersion_CMHG	
#define Module_Date_CMHG      		25 Sep 1997

#define Module_MajorVersion     	"0.07"
#define Module_MinorVersion		""
#define Module_Date      		"25 Sep 1997"
</pre>
</blockquote>
The following is the format of the <code>VersionASM</code> file. It is used by assembler modules or module wrapped C applications to provide the version numbers etc.
<blockquote>
<pre>
;
; This file is automatically maintained by srccommit, do not edit manually.
;
			GBLS	Module_MajorVersion
			GBLS	Module_MinorVersion
			GBLS	Module_Date
Module_MajorVersion	SETS    "0.01"
Module_MinorVersion	SETS	""
Module_Date		SETS    "26 Sep 1997"
		        END
</pre>
</blockquote>

It is the responsibility of the author to ensure that the constants defined in this file are used within their module as appropriate. It has been decided that the minor version number will be present following the module date string in the area currently used for free formatted text. This allows the origin of a particular source to be determined very easily. For example for cmhg :
<pre>
<blockquote>
help-string: FooBar Module_MajorVersion_CMHG Module_MinorVersion_CMHG
</blockquote>
</pre>
or for assembler :
<pre>
<blockquote>
help  = "FooBar",9,"$Module_MajorVersion ($Module_Date) $Module_MinorVersion",0
</blockquote>
</pre>
