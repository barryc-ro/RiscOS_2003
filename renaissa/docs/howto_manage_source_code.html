<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>
This document originates from the Configuration Management group, one of the groups which was setup in 1998 to examine Acorn's project process. Queries concerning this document should be addressed to the author or the Configuration Management group.

<P>
In theory, CVS allows concurrent development by an unlimited number of people; in practice  many components are used by more that one project. When modifying an existing component all changes <B>must</B> be carefully planned before they are made, with regards to all projects in which the component is used. It is undesirable to have shared components diverging along different branches.

<P>
This guide is not intended to be a CVS manual although in places it does refer to CVS commands and assumes that the reader is familiar with CVS terminology. Refer to one of the CVS manuals<SUP><A HREF="#[1]">[1]</A></SUP> for details of the CVS commands needed to implement the procedures described in this document.

<H2>Basic rules of CVS use within Acorn</H2>
<P>
Specified development occurs on the trunk, with branches for projects only created once the components used in that project are feature complete. The purpose of branches is to allow protection from other peoples' changes, not to enable your own development.

<P>
Situations may occur where a single component needs two separate changes to it for two separate projects and one or both of these needs to be implemented in a short space of time (with carefully planned and co-ordinated development this should not happen very often). In these circumstances it is not desirable for both sets of development to occur on the trunk because each developer's  testing would be affected by the other's changes - in this case it is acceptable for the development to occur on a branch and be folded back in.

<P>
If/when bugs are found in core components after a project/component has been branched, and the fix would benefit all other projects which use the component then the bug <B>should</B> be fixed on the trunk and then pulled onto the branches as appropriate. Of course, this means that there is a possibility of pulling in other changes that have been made to that component since it was branched, but these changes can easily be determined and it requires a conscious decision to incorporate them.

<P>
The trunk <B>must not</B> be used to check in 'works in progress'. If you wish to make changes to a component on the trunk where you might need to check in changes before they are fully complete or tested then you <B>must</B> create a 'personal branch' of that component - this is described later in this document.

<P>
Srccommit<SUP><A HREF="#[2]">[2]</A></SUP> <B>must</B> used to ensure that version numbers remain unique and that modifications are automatically given a meaningful tag (based on the component version number) so that any version can easily be extracted at a later date.

<H2>Organising code on your home mount</H2>
<P>
Sometimes an individual is working on more than project, or is buildmaster for that project as well as being a developer for it. In these cases it is a good idea to keep source trees separate for each project (or have separate work and build directories for a single project in the case of a buildmaster) to avoid confusion and accidental mistakes.

<H2>Creating a new component</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Ensure that your component conforms to the standard build system (skeleton components are available on CVS<SUP><A HREF="#[3]">[3]</A></SUP> which illustrate how to do this). For RISC&nbsp;OS components this includes ensuring that the throwback facility is switch off for ROM builds. The skeleton components include the facility to enable throwback for local builds only.
<LI>Decide where in the source tree your component should be placed. Do this in conjunction with your project's buildmaster and, where appropriate, people in the technology ownership group in which your component resides.
<LI>Ensure that your component can be built cleanly (with no warnings) in the standard build environment.
<LI>Ensure that your component is in a clean state i.e. no files that are automatically generated at build time are present.
<LI>The easiest way to place a new component under CVS control is to use the cvsimport<SUP><A HREF="#[4]">[4]</A></SUP> and cvsbinaries scripts.
</UL>

<H2>Updating an existing component</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Ensure that your component is in a clean state i.e. no files that are automatically generated at build time are present.
<LI>If you want, you can check what modifications will happen (and if anyone else has already committed changes) using cvs -nq update.
<LI>Bring your working directory up-to-date with any changes that other people have made to the component. CVS will indicate any conflicting changes, which you <B>must</B> resolve before you will be allowed to commit anything. If other people's changes are merged into your changes then start the update process again from the beginning.
<LI>Use srccommit to commit your changes and increment the version number.
<LI>Enter an appropriate message in the log<SUP><A HREF="#[5]">[5]</A></SUP>.
</UL>

<H2>Developing code somewhere other than your home mount</H2>
<P>
CVS keeps control files for each directory (stored in a directory called 'CVS') which tell it the versions of the files that you have in your working directory. The danger with developing code somewhere other than your home mount is if you do the following:
<OL>
<LI>Copy code from your home mount to another location.
<LI>Modify the copied code.
<LI>Do a CVS update on the code on your home mount to merge in other people's changes.
<LI>Copy your modified code back to your home mount and check it in.
</OL>

<P>
When you perform step 3, CVS will update the CVS control files on your home mount to reflect the version numbers of the files that have been updated. As far as CVS is concerned you are up-to-date with respect to the repository at that point. When you perform step 4, you will overwrite the files on your home mount, losing any changes pulled in by step 3. When you do the commit, CVS thinks that you are up-to-date and so the changes pulled in by step 3 will be lost in your new version of the code.

<P>
If you want to develop code somewhere more convenient than your home mount (e.g.. your machine's local hard drive - likely if you develop on RISC&nbsp;OS) then use the following procedure.
<OL>
<LI>Checkout code onto your home mount.
<LI>Copy the code to your development environment.
<LI>When you want to check your modified code in, or merge in other peoples' updates to your working version, copy the code back to your NFS mount.
<LI>Issue the appropriate CVS commands.
<LI>Copy the code back to your development environment if necessary.
</OL>

<P>
People developing on RISC&nbsp;OS can use the EraseCVS utility (available on the Renaissa NFS mount<SUP><A HREF="#[6]">[6]</A></SUP>) to automatically remove the CVS control files from their working copy of the code on their hard disc (be careful not to accidentally use this on your home mount!). This helps to keep your code tidier and prevents the CVS control files accidentally being pulled into the build process somehow (e.g. the CVS control files in a directory containing C header files might be accidentally exported as part of a library). This approach also saves a considerable amount of hard drive space when working with large source trees.

<P>
An advantage of not using EraseCVS is that if you accidentally do make the mistake discussed at the start of this section, you can restore the correct CVS control files from your hard drive. However, if you rely on this then you need to be careful that you do not accidentally remove some of the CVS control files e.g. when performing a 'clean' of your component.

<H2>Tagging</H2>
<P>
Every time a component is modified and committed using srccommit its version number is incremented and the component is automatically tagged.

<P>
If you make a mistake when checking in a new version of a component (inevitable sooner or later) then it is acceptable to correct the mistake, recommit the errant files and move the tag you just applied on those files. You should only do this if you are sure that nobody else has started using your errant version; if in doubt increment the version number and create a new tag.

<H2>Branches and version numbers</H2>
<P>
Since it is possible to develop a component on more than one branch the potential arises for duplicate version numbers (which relate to different changes) between branches, which would cause extreme confusion.

<P>
When operating on branches, srccommit automatically appends a minor version number (the CVS revision number of the component's version number file) to the tag, which can be used to differentiate a component being developed on more than one branch. However, there is currently no way to automatically make use of this from software - it only exists as a visual aid to developers. This means that if a component is released from a branch then care must be taken to ensure that the major version number is unique, which may involve having to manually adjust the major version number of the component on the branch. This required communication and cooperation between people working on the component on different branches.

<P>
It is reasonable for users to assume that numerically later versions of a component will contain the features of numerically earlier ones, so developers must be aware of this when releasing components from branches. e.g. if version 0.54 was released from branch A, 0.55 from branch B then 0.56 from branch A, a user will expect version 0.55 to contain the features of 0.54, and 0.56 to contain the features of 0.55 even though this does not reflect the way in which they were developed. Again, careful planning and coordination of changes will minimise these situations, but when they do occur developers need to be aware that they may need to merge two versions. The only alternative to this is to provide a method by which a user can find out what features a particular version of your component supports (e.g. a SWI call in a RISC&nbsp;OS relocatable module). This is only really practical for relatively small components.

<P>
To help with this a database of component names, version numbers and srccommit version numbers will be setup and maintained as part of the Drawing Office. This will provide an easy way for developers to check whether they are in danger of duplicating a version number before they assign one. It also provides an early warning should a clash actually occur.

<P>
If a component is diverging widely along two different branches then it may be sensible to split the component into two new independent components. Before doing this consider the alternatives of using conditional compilation within the source code, or if most of the differences are contained in just a few files, having different versions of file(s). A complete split must only be done after careful consideration: past experience has shown that this can create more problems than it solves and the two components end up getting merged back together again (e.g. the RISC&nbsp;OS NFS relocatable module).

<H2>Personal branches</H2>
<P>
Situations arise where a component needs to undergo a major overhaul which will take a relatively long time, while the existing version of that component may continue development (in particular have bug fixes applied).

<P>
The way to deal with this is to use personal branches. If individuals create their own branches, the branch name <B>should</B> be prefixed with the person's login id. The branch name <B>must</B> also include the name of the component, the version of the component on which this development is based and some indication that this is a development branch (to distinguish it from tags generated by srccommit).

<P>
&lt;login id&gt;_&lt;component&gt;_dev-&lt;base version&gt;
<P>
e.g.. blaughto_Daytona_dev-0_42

<P>
When you create a branch you <B>should</B> also label the point at which the branch was taken. This is done using an ordinary symbolic tag rather than a branch tag. The name of this tag should be the same as the name of your new beach with _bp appended to the end.

<P>
e.g.. blaughto_Daytona_dev-0_42_bp

<P>
When development and testing of one of these branches is complete it should be folded back into it's parent branch. [This is fairly trivial for a personal branch of a single component. The consequences are obviously far greater when folding in an entire project branch to the trunk.] Once the merged component has been tested and verified to work the branch should be closed so that no further development can take place on it - if you needed to do more similar development after a merge then you should start a new branch with a new base version number.

<H2>Third party components and vendor branches</H2>
<P>
Developers need to be aware that not all components in the source tree are owned by Acorn. There are many varying degrees of restriction that are placed on the distribution of some components and violating these restrictions has potentially serious legal implications (even if done accidentally). Such components <B>must</B> have a file called LICENCE in their root which contains details of the licence, or a pointer to where the details can be obtained.

<P>
Vendor branches can be used to import unmodified distributions from a third party. If any modifications are made to this then they will be committed to the trunk. See the CVS manual for further details. There is one danger to be aware of when using vendor branches: if the component that you are importing already exists in the CVS repository before you first try to create a proper vendor branch then the procedure described in the CVS manual will not work. In fact it is not possible to create a genuine vendor branch in such circumstances, but it is possible to simulate one<SUP><A HREF="#[7]">[7]</A></SUP>.
<B></B>
<H2>Miscellaneous considerations</H2>
<P>
With the introduction of long filenames on RISC&nbsp;OS and the increasing use of cross-compilation, porting etc. it is likely that people will start using filenames longer than 10 characters. To ensure compatibility across all systems, care should be taken to ensure that in such cases files are checked in using long filenames, not the 10 character truncated ones generated by RISC&nbsp;OS. Also, filenames in Makefiles and the inclusion of header files must use the full length filenames. If possible, ensure that all filenames are unique in the first 10 characters so that components can still be built on RISC&nbsp;OS systems with a 10 character filename limit.

<P>
Case sensitivity is also an issue on some systems. To ensure compatibility with such systems you should always use case-correct filenames. However, you must also cater for non case sensitive systems by ensuring that filenames remain unique when case is ignored.

<P>
RISC&nbsp;OS users should also be aware that when a file is moved from e.g. ADFS to NFS the time stamp of the file can change by a small amount.
