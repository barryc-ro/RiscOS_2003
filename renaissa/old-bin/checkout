# Note that when checking this script in, file permissions must be set to 775.

# 19/04/1999 : Removed the commented out changes from the original script.
#            : Made it allow comments at the end of a component line.
#	     : Added initial support for the Unix<->RiscOS semaphore file.
# 06/05/1999 : Made the semaphore file be written during every checkout.
#            : Made checkput errors be written to the semaphore file.
#            : Initial work on checking whether component needs updating or 
#               not.
# 03/06/1999 : Started adding code to create an obey file with all updated
#              component present in it. This obey file will then be used to 
#              copy over all the changed resources.
# 13/06/1999 : Removed reliance on cvsbs.pl
# 15/06/1999 : Altered to use NBingham's updated RiscOS-side scripts.
#               Sempahore file code has been removeed as it is now 
#               unnecessary (communications done via rsh), and added support
#               for the ERRORS file, to which errors get output so they can
#               be picked up by the RiscOS side. All error conditions inside
#               this Perl script should use the error() routine, along with
#               an explanatory string.
# 17/06/1999 : Removed the renaming of old tagged components and instead cvs
#               -Q release -d them, which is altogether neater.
# 23/06/1999 : Altered to merge the AutoBuild obey file with this one as
#               requested by NBingham. Hopefully this will remove the crashes
#               which may be related to obey-file nesting.
# 17/08/1999 : (SBrodie) Taught it about tracking tags.  An optional third
#               parameter in the modules list can be the single keyword
#               "track" which indicates that the tag specified is not 
#               symbolic (ie. a branch or magic tag like HEAD).  Script will 
#               apply its own tag $user_autobuild_$$product to such 
#               components and use it to diff against the specified tag to 
#               determine whether an update is required of that component, 
#               and then moves the tag to whatever was just checked out. 
#               HEAD is known to this script and implies track automatically.
# 01/09/1999 : (DCotton) Moved some variable definitions to the top of the
#               script to avoid warnings about them not being initialized. No
#               functional changes.
# 03/09/1999 : (DCotton). Altered so that if the
#               <AutoBuild$UseNewNamingScheme> is set to "Yes" then the
#               script uses the new naming image conventions. If it is set to
#		anything else then it still uses the old ImageName perl
#		script.
# 08/09/1999 : (DCotton). Some tidying up done.
# 14/09/1999 : (DCotton). Added support for the -localfile flag. If this is
#               set, then the program does not check out the product file
#               from CVS but uses a local copy instead. This is to aid
#               testing of the script only; it stops us from having to check
#               in a new file each time we want to test a new feature.
# 15/09/1999 : (DCotton). No longer stops when it comes across an error in
#               the product file, but continues on. Hence there can be more
#               than one error in the ERRORS file. Done so that in one pass
#               through a product file all the incorrect entries can be
#               quickly seen. 
# 23/09/1999 : (DCotton). Updated to cope with !EraseCVS and !Perl being
#               checked out of CVS. The build machine now no longer has to
#               have these two items on it as a matter of course.
# 05/11/1999 : (DCotton/SBrodie). Now deals with Tags that start with an N as
#               well as a T. Added because CVS version 1.10.7 now appends N
#               to the tag name instead of T if yo check out as a symbolic 
#		tag.
# 06/01/2000 : (DCotton). Now uses do mkdir -p to create the directory
#               structure for components under RISC OS instead of having all
#               that nasty recursing down the path and creating the
#               direcrories individually.
# 21/01/2000 : (DCotton). Added support for the "Using Repository" command. 
#               Not currently used, but hopefully support will be added soon.
#               Also used the opportunity to create a main() routine that 
#               gathered up the main routine.
# 16/02/2000 : (DCotton). Now checks for $USERNAME and sets the relevant
#               $USER system variable accordingly. This is the first step of
#               making the scripts work under NT. It also calls a generic
#               delete_tree() routine instead of rm-rf directly.
#               Also now detects whether we are running on MSWin32.

checkout checks out the product module and the modules which incorporate
the product. All the modules are checked out into the current directory.

If no release tag is specified, or the special release tag main is used,
the latest committed versions of all the modules are checked out instead
of any particular version - the version field in the product modules
file is ignored.

If the release tag is a branch tag, the latest committed versions of the
modules on that branch are checked out.

If -localfile is passed in as a parameter, then it uses the next parameter as
the name of a local file (i.e. the same directory as the one that script is
run from) to use as the Product file.
