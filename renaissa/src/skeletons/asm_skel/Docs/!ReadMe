These notes have been put together to provide a skeleton ASM module structure
that will fit into the Acorn ROM build mechanism.

Variations on this core structre might consist of :
* Sources - conditional assembly of debug/non-debug versions of the module
* rm - multiple targets based on machine/system/userif oriented builds
* Docs - location of useful nugets of info
* Resources - different locales, userif etc
* Test - location of any test harnesses used - sources and makefiles in same
  style as build process.
